    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, containing detailed budget information and economic forecasts. The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 released by the Bush Administration includes historical budget data, detailed budget authority, outlay and receipt data, analysis of budget-related topics, policy proposals from FY2007 through FY2012, and information on long-term fiscal issues. The documents discuss budget policies for FY2012 through FY2017, long-term fiscal issues, historical data on appropriations, outlays, and revenues. The congressional budget process begins with the Administration submitting its budget to Congress, and revisions are made as Congress deliberates. Congress adopted the conference report on the FY2008 budget resolution on May 17, 2007. Congress often revises its proposals as it interacts with Members of Congress and as economic conditions change. The FY2008 budget resolution conference report was adopted on May 17, 2007. By August 5, the House had passed all twelve regular appropriations bills for FY2008, while the Senate passed some bills in July and mid-September. The House and Senate passed various appropriations bills for FY2008, with the Senate failing to pass all bills by September 30. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until November 16, and the President signed it into law. Congress later approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill. On September 26, the House passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 52) to fund the government until November 16, which the Senate also passed. The President signed the resolution on September 29 (P.L. 110-92). Congress approved the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) providing $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority, which the President signed. The President's veto threats on appropriation bills may have complicated the process. The President vetoed many appropriation bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements, complicating the process. Congress passed funding extensions until December 21, with an omnibus appropriations bill passed on December 19. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that included 10 regular appropriations bills. A fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) was also passed. Another continuing resolution (P.L. 110-149) was signed by the President on December 21, funding government operations through the end of the year. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The President signed the omnibus measure, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 included baseline deficit estimates and economic projections for FY2007 through FY2017. It projected a decrease in the FY2008 baseline deficit compared to FY2007. Budget estimates from different sources may vary due to differences in assumptions and techniques. Projections are subject to change with new data and economic conditions. The FY2008 budget report projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, lower than the FY2007 deficit of $172 billion. The CBO baseline showed a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and a projected surplus of $249 billion in FY2017. Assumptions in CBO baseline projections include constant discretionary spending in inflation-adjusted terms and the impact of tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The CBO baseline projections include assumptions of slower growth in discretionary spending, the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts after 2010, and the lapse of the AMT \"patch.\" These factors contribute to a declining deficit and significant revenue growth after 2010. After 2010, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 will expire, leading to substantial revenue growth. The projected declining deficit and emerging surpluses are mainly due to the expiration of tax cuts and zero growth in discretionary spending. Future deficits are expected to increase rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window, driven by the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The CBO report includes estimated budgetary effects of selected policies not included in baseline estimates. Future deficits are expected to increase rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and growing healthcare costs. The CBO's report includes estimated budgetary effects of selected policies such as making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, increasing discretionary appropriations, and freezing total discretionary appropriations. The CBO's analysis of the President's budget proposals in March 2007 forecasted slightly higher revenues and smaller outlays, resulting in a projected FY2008 deficit of $226 billion. By FY2012, the President's proposals were expected to produce a deficit of $31 billion, rather than a $61 billion surplus. The CBO projected a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion, smaller than the President's budget estimate. By FY2012, the deficit was expected to be $31 billion instead of a $61 billion surplus. The difference in forecasts is due to uncertainty in medium-term projections. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The President's budget had a cumulative net deficit estimate of $514 billion for the same period. The President's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. Additionally, the budget includes a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for Social Security. Administration proposals aim to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and by $309 billion over 10 years. The Administration's budget proposes policy changes to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years. It includes a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for personal accounts for Social Security, with projected savings of $59 billion over five years and increases of $359 billion over 10 years. The budget also includes limited information for years beyond FY2012. The Administration's budget proposes policy changes to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, including a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for personal Social Security accounts. The budget provides limited information for years beyond FY2012, omitting data for individual years after FY2012 and projections for other budget components. The President proposed eliminating, reducing, or reforming about 141 programs. The President proposed eliminating, reducing, or reforming about 141 programs, affecting discretionary and mandatory spending. Administration estimates show a $22 billion cut in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Administration's Mid-Session Review in July reiterated these proposals, with some deterioration in the FY2008 budget outlook since February. The Administration's Mid-Session Review in July showed a $19 billion increase in the FY2008 deficit estimate compared to the February estimate. The cumulative five-year deficit estimate rose from $514 billion to $651 billion in the MSR, with a significant portion attributed to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending due to rising healthcare prices and hospital costs. The FY2008 deficit estimate increased by $19 billion in the Administration's Mid-Session Review, with a significant portion attributed to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending due to rising healthcare prices and hospital costs. CBO estimates spending totals for discretionary appropriations legislation through a process known as \"scoring.\" The CBO analyzed FY2008 appropriations legislation, estimating $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Emergency spending is treated differently in budget legislation. The FY2008 appropriations legislation provided $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment included an additional $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The McConnell Amendment to the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act allocated an extra $70 billion for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution projected a $249 billion deficit for FY2008, with a $132 billion surplus expected in FY2012. Differences in revenue and outlay levels were noted between the Senate's proposal and the President's. The Senate budget resolution proposed higher discretionary spending levels than the President's proposal. It also included extending expiring tax cuts if offset by lost revenues. The FY2008 totals were similar between the Senate's reported resolution and versions passed in March, with amendments reducing expected deficits for FY2012. The FY2008 totals in both the SBC-reported resolution and versions passed by the Senate on March 23 were almost identical, although amendments adopted by the Senate reduced the expected FY2012 surplus to $1 billion. The House Budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) was expected to yield a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion, requiring offsets to extend expiring tax cuts. All proposals aim for a balanced budget in FY2012. The House resolution, like the Senate resolution, required offsets to extend expiring tax cuts and aimed for a balanced budget in FY2012. The Administration, House, and Senate all assumed minimal or nonexistent funding for military operations after FY2008, leading to lower outlays. These proposals also anticipated more middle-income taxpayers becoming subject to taxes. The President's budget assumes minimal funding for military operations after FY2008 and projects a larger portion of middle-income taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. It also anticipates little to no growth in discretionary spending over the next five years. The President's budget assumes minimal funding for military operations after FY2008 and projects more middle-income taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, which boosts estimated tax revenues. Budget projections are uncertain, with different assumptions on tax cuts and discretionary spending growth. Budget forecasts are uncertain due to various factors such as policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. The quality of economic forecasts is measured by statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. OMB and CBO provide some insight into budget projections. Budget forecasts are influenced by policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. OMB and CBO assess the accuracy of their forecasts. Models used for projections consider economic structure, tax and program changes, and other factors. Economic conditions like growth rate, inflation, and policy changes impact budget estimates. The budget forecasts are affected by economic conditions, policy changes, and technical factors. Changes in economic conditions, such as growth rate and inflation, along with policy changes, impact budget estimates. Factors like the structure of the economy, tax and program changes, and demographic trends also play a role in budget projections. Budget estimates are influenced by stable trends like population demographics, such as the upcoming retirement of baby boomers leading to increased spending on Medicare and Social Security. However, factors like future productivity growth and business cycles are harder to predict. Federal revenues can be affected by volatile financial market trends, with small changes in economic conditions causing significant shifts in budget estimates. Factors affecting federal revenues, such as financial market trends and GDP growth, can lead to significant changes in budget estimates. A 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over 10 years. Government policies, like military operations in Iraq or tax cuts, also impact budget outlook. The President's FY2008 budget includes measures to analyze the accuracy of previous forecasts, which show that forecast accuracy declines over time due to policy and economic changes.OMB analyzed a quarter century of deficit estimates to understand why budget estimates differ from actual results. The accuracy of forecasts declines over time due to policy and economic changes. OMB analyzed a quarter century of deficit estimates and found that the standard deviation for the current fiscal year was $71 billion, while the corresponding five-years-ahead forecast had a standard deviation of $289 billion. This resulted in upper and lower bounds for deficit projections with a gap of over $1.1 trillion after five years. The OMB analyzed deficit estimates over a quarter century, finding a standard deviation of $71 billion for the current fiscal year and $289 billion for five-years-ahead forecasts. This led to upper and lower bounds for deficit projections with a gap exceeding $1.1 trillion after five years. CBO extensively analyzes budget estimate accuracy and explains differences from OMB projections. The CBO analyzes budget estimates extensively, includes forecast accuracy in budget publications, and explains differences from OMB projections. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution after debates and amendments. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution on March 23, debated and passed it on March 29. Both resolutions aimed for additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request, with rules requiring offsets to new tax cuts or mandatory spending increases. Conferees were appointed in early May to resolve differences between the House and Senate. After lengthy discussions, conferees appointed by both the House and Senate reached an agreement on the FY2008 budget resolution, setting discretionary spending at $954 billion, exceeding the President's request. The House and Senate adopted the agreement on May 17, 2007. The FY2008 budget resolution agreement set discretionary spending at $954 billion, surpassing the President's request. The House and Senate adopted the agreement in May 2007, leading to the drafting of FY2008 appropriations bills by the Appropriations Committees. By mid-July, most of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been approved by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. In early June, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2007. By the end of FY2007, the House had passed all 12 bills, while the Senate had passed four and later passed three more in October. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills in November, with the President vetoing the former and signing the latter. The President indicated intentions to veto most remaining appropriations bills due to disagreements on policy and spending levels. In FY2007, Congress passed a continuing resolution to fund government operations until November 16, which the President signed. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding until December. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710), which the President vetoed, and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116), which he signed. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding for government operations until December 14. On December 14, Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) extending funding for another week, signed by the President (P.L. 110-137). On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 remaining regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that included 10 remaining regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, $84 billion above the CBO baseline. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. Both the Administration and CBO have issued projections of future federal outlays, reflecting Congress's priorities for spending and revenues. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed $2,902 billion in outlays, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. The proposals would boost funding for defense and homeland security spending, hold non-defense discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, and slow the growth in some mandatory programs. Total mandatory spending would increase, with a $30 billion increase in FY2012 for personal accounts for Social Security. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed increasing outlays by $150 billion (5.5%) above the FY2008 current services baseline, with a total outlay increase of 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012. This includes a $30 billion increase in FY2012 for personal accounts for Social Security. Total mandatory spending would increase under the proposals. The proposed FY2008 budget aims to increase total outlays by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012, exceeding the current services baseline by $150 billion (5.5%). The increase is mainly for security activities, including defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, with additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Non-security discretionary spending would see a $8 billion increase (1.8%), while mandatory spending would be reduced by $10 billion (0.7%) compared to baseline levels. The proposed additional security funding is for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The budget also includes an $8 billion increase (1.8%) for non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion (0.7%) reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. The Administration's budget shows a $7 billion (2.8%) increase in net interest payments from baseline levels in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. The overall $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008 is due to various factors, including automatic cost-of-living adjustments, population growth, policy changes, and higher costs due to inflation. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce outlays from 20.2% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.0% of GDP in FY2008, with projections showing a decrease to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012. This includes a projected decrease in non-defense discretionary spending by 0.7% of GDP over five years and a 1.1% decrease in defense spending. Various factors contribute to the $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008, such as cost-of-living adjustments, population growth, policy changes, and inflation. The Administration's projections show outlays falling to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012, the lowest since FY1960. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP over five years, while defense spending is expected to fall by 1.1% of GDP. Mandatory programs increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, while net interest falls by 0.2% of GDP. Medicare and Medicaid are expected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP. The President's budget proposes a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008. The Administration's budget proposes a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008, reaching $603 billion. Non-defense discretionary spending is also set to exceed the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion for FY2008. Over the next five years, non-defense discretionary outlays are projected to grow by an average of 0.7% annually. The Administration's proposed non-defense discretionary spending for FY2008 exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion. Over the next five years, the Administration's proposed levels show a decrease in non-defense discretionary spending, dropping from $511 billion in FY2007 and FY2008 to $493 billion in FY2012. As a percentage of GDP, non-defense discretionary spending falls from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending decreased from $511 billion in FY2007 and FY2008 to $493 billion in FY2012, dropping from 3.7% of GDP to 2.8% of GDP. The Administration aimed to achieve reductions in mandatory spending, with a proposed growth of 4.2% ($62 billion) from FY2007 to FY2008. Reducing mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008 was part of the plan, although specific details were lacking. In the President's budget, spending grows by 4.2% ($62 billion) from FY2007 to FY2008. Proposals include reducing mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008, achieved by slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending is projected to decrease by almost $60 billion over five years. Mandatory spending remains the largest federal spending category, increasing from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012. Mandatory spending is projected to total $1,100 billion, growing to $1,923 billion in FY2012. Net interest outlays are rising, leading to higher federal debt and interest payments. Proposed net interest outlays in FY2008 exceed the Administration's current budget. The federal debt has been growing rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue growing under the Administration's proposals. Net interest outlays are also increasing, with proposed outlays in FY2008 exceeding the Administration's current budget estimate by $7.8 billion. Additionally, the Administration's policy proposals would raise net interest outlays in FY2012 by almost $30 billion above its current services estimate. Despite these increases, net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to show little change over the next five years, ranging between 1.6% and 1.8% of GDP. According to Administration estimates, net interest payments as a percentage of GDP will remain stable between 1.6% and 1.8% over the next five years. CBO projections show federal outlays rising to 20.8% of GDP in FY2008 before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012, with FY2017 outlays at 20.3% of GDP. Many analysts believe that CBO's current-law baseline underestimates future growth in discretionary spending. Federal outlays are projected to grow by an additional $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period if discretionary spending grows at the same rate as the economy. On the other hand, if discretionary spending remains fixed at FY2007 levels, federal outlays would decrease by $1.65 trillion. Defense spending is expected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008 according to CBO baseline estimates. Defense spending is projected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008 according to CBO baseline estimates. The baseline assumptions show defense spending increasing to $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. Defense spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to gradually decrease over the 10-year period, from 4.0% in FY2007 to 4.2% in FY2008. Defense spending is projected to rise to $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017, with a gradual decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP over the 10-year period. Alternative scenarios suggest lower spending trajectories if troops are withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. Withdrawing troops could reduce discretionary spending and interest costs by about $1.25 trillion over the period FY2008-FY2017. The CBO projects that withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan could significantly reduce discretionary spending and interest costs. Withdrawing all but 30,000 troops by 2010 could save about $1.25 trillion, while withdrawing all but 75,000 troops by 2013 could save about $750 billion over the period FY2008-FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017. CBO projects non-defense discretionary spending to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017, with a decrease in percentage of GDP over the same period. Both CBO and Administration projections show discretionary spending's relative size shrinking over time. The CBO projects an increase in mandatory spending from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion by FY2017. Mandatory spending as a share of GDP is expected to remain relatively stable, moving from 10.6% in FY2007 to 10.8% in FY2012 according to CBO baseline projections. CBO projections show mandatory spending increasing to $2,598 billion by FY2017, with net interest growing from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. Smaller deficits in later years are expected to slow federal debt growth, leading to projected surpluses in FY2012 and beyond, reducing federal debt and lowering net interest payments. The CBO baseline projections show smaller deficits in later years, leading to projected surpluses in FY2012 and beyond. This would reduce federal debt and lower net interest payments, which are expected to peak at $292 billion in FY2012 before easing back to $278 billion in FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, increasing to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The resolution included defense funding matching the President's request for FY2008, with domestic spending exceeding the Administration's proposal. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution on March 23, which was passed by the House with no amendments. The Senate passed the resolution with amendments on March 23, with outlays close to the committee's version. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution on March 23, which was passed by the House on March 29. The resolution would provide $2,933 billion in outlays in FY2008, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The conference agreement on May 17, 2007, included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. The agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Spending by category as percentages of GDP from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review shows little difference from the President's February 2007 budget. Actual outlays for defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending from FY2000 through FY2006, and the Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012 are depicted in Figure 1. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are expected to decline over the five-year period FY2007-FY2012, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012 show a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The downturn in discretionary spending relative to GDP after FY2008 depends on assumptions that non-defense discretionary spending falls after 2007 and no additional spending is provided for ongoing military operations overseas after FY2008. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending are also part of the plan. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending from current service baseline levels keep mandatory spending as a share of GDP stable. The FY2012 introduction of private Social Security accounts would lift mandatory spending relative to GDP above the current services level. Figure 2 shows four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending from current service baseline levels keep mandatory spending as a share of GDP stable. The FY2012 introduction of private Social Security accounts would lift mandatory spending relative to GDP above the current services level. Figure 2 displays four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017, including the President's FY2008 budget proposal, a revised proposal, an alternative outlook from CBO data, and the CBO reestimate of the President's original FY2008 proposals. The President's proposed outlays decrease after FY2007 due to reduced discretionary spending and slower growth in mandatory programs. By FY2012, spending would be slightly below its FY2000 level as a percentage of GDP. Outlays in the Mid-Session Review are slightly higher than in the February budget, mainly due to reestimation. In FY2012, spending would be just below its level as a percentage of GDP in FY2000. Outlays in the Mid-Session Review are slightly above those in the February budget, mainly due to reestimation rather than policy changes. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary appropriations grow with the overall economy and a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by FY2013. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary spending will grow with the overall economy and a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by FY2013, leading to increased outlays, deficits, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects higher net interest payments and outlays as a percentage of GDP rising to 21.1% in FY2017. Federal receipts are forecasted to be influenced by economic conditions beyond the immediate short term. The future path of federal receipts, as projected by the Administration and CBO, is summarized in Table 4. Recent years have seen rapid growth in receipts, with increases following years of falling receipts. Receipts rose from 16.3% of GDP in FY2004, the lowest level. Receipts grew significantly from FY2003 to FY2006, following three years of decline. OMB's MSR showed little variation in receipts as a share of GDP from FY2008 to FY2012. CBO's baseline projected a rise in receipts after the expiration of tax cuts, reaching 19.8% of GDP in FY2012. Receipts increased by 4.8% in current dollars from FY2007 to FY2008 under the Administration's FY2008. Receipts as a percentage of GDP ranged between 18.4% (FY2008) and 18.7% (FY2012). The President's proposals aimed to extend and make permanent most expiring tax cuts, leading to a rise in receipts to 18.6% of GDP by FY2012. The Administration estimated that making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by $374 billion from baseline levels between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. This and other Administration proposals would reduce receipts by an estimated $599 billion in the first five years and by $1,854 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposals, including making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, would reduce receipts by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. Additionally, proposed relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) would cost $48 billion in FY2008. Receipts from the President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review are shown in Figure 3. Receipts from the President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review for FY2007 through FY2012 show stable corporate income taxes and social insurance receipts. Individual income taxes fluctuate but regain some lost share under the Administration's proposals. Individual income taxes fell from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% in FY2004, but regained some lost share under the Administration's proposals. The Administration's proposals included extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008, as a growing number of middle-class taxpayers would be affected by the AMT without changes. Temporary AMT \"fixes\" were estimated to cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion. The FY2008 budget estimated that temporary AMT \"fixes\" would cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008, with CBO estimating that indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion a year over the next 10 years. The President's budget aimed to limit the growing reach of the AMT but omitted estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix, potentially increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year post-FY2008. The President's budget aimed to limit the growing reach of the AMT but omitted estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix, potentially increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year post-FY2008. Total receipts in the budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP, while CBO's baseline revenue estimates are larger, rising to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and to 20.1% of GDP in FY2017. CBO's baseline revenue estimates project an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017, excluding the extension of tax cuts. Extending expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending all expiring tax cuts would further reduce revenues by $870 billion in the first five years and $3,178 billion over 10 years. Extending expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years. CBO's March 2007 budget report projected slightly lower revenues than the President's budget in most years. The CBO's March 2007 budget report analyzed the President's FY2008 policy proposals, showing slightly lower revenues than the President's budget in most years due to differences in economic assumptions. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than CBO's cumulative revenue baseline estimates over five years. The CBO's March 2007 budget report analyzed the President's FY2008 policy proposals, showing slightly lower revenues than the President's budget in most years due to differences in economic assumptions. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than CBO's cumulative revenue baseline estimates over five years, with a 2% decrease in cumulative revenues. The revised revenue baseline estimates in CBO's March report differed only slightly from the January estimates, projecting slower growth in receipts both in dollars and as shares of GDP. The report presented revised revenue baseline estimates that differed slightly from CBO's January estimates. Modifying CBO's baseline revenue estimates by using alternative policy assumptions results in slower growth in receipts, both in dollars and as a percentage of GDP. The alternative estimate includes extensions of expiring tax cuts, adjustments to the AMT, and the interaction effect of these policies. AMT reform combined with tax cut extensions leads to greater revenue losses, with receipts projected to fall to around 17.5% of GDP. The alternative revenue assumptions, including extensions of expiring tax cuts and AMT reform, would result in significant revenue losses. By FY2017, the alternative projection falls $560 billion below the baseline. The House and Senate budget resolutions do not include extending expiring tax cuts. The House and Senate budget resolutions do not incorporate extending expiring tax provisions without offsetting their cost. Instructions in the budget resolutions generally require revenue changes to have offsets to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. The conference agreement allows for extending some expiring tax cuts under certain conditions. The conference agreement included provisions to extend expiring tax cuts with offsets to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown in Figure 4, with actual receipts from FY2000 to FY2006 and projections from CBO and the President's budget submissions. Federal receipts averaged 18.3% of GDP over a 41-year period. Federal receipts as a percentage of GDP have averaged 18.3% over a 41-year period. Projections from CBO and the President's budget submissions show estimates close through FY2010, with receipts rising slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017 according to CBO's reestimate. CBO's revenue reestimate and the President's revenue estimates are similar through FY2012, with receipts projected to rise slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over the five years, with a slight increase in the last year. OMB's MSR projects slightly larger receipts than the February budget, assuming tax cuts are extended and an adjustment to the AMT expansion occurs only through FY2008. The OMB sets of estimates assume tax cuts are extended and an adjustment to the AMT expansion occurs only through FY2008. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt. The federal government incurs deficits when spending exceeds receipts, leading to an increase in government debt. Surpluses occur when receipts surpass outlays, reducing the federal debt. Running surpluses during periods of strong economic growth is seen as beneficial by many economists. The last surplus was in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The actual FY2007 deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's projections. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's projections. The President's February budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The President's February budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008, with a small surplus projected for FY2012. The Administration's baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew compared to estimates in the President's budget. The July 2007 Mid-Session Review showed minimal differences from the February budget, with the FY2007 deficit decreasing slightly and the FY2008 deficit increasing. The MSR projected larger deficits in subsequent years, aiming for a small surplus in FY2012. To achieve deficit reduction goals, the Administration proposed strict limits on discretionary spending growth and slower entitlement spending growth. The Administration aims to reach budget deficit reduction goals by limiting discretionary spending growth and slowing entitlement spending. Some of the President's proposals may increase spending or reduce receipts, necessitating larger spending cuts in other areas. The federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011 and surpluses are expected from FY2012 to FY2017. The CBO projects federal deficit reduction through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Tax increases and expiration of tax cuts are key factors in boosting revenues. Discretionary spending growth is also a factor in the projections. The CBO projects federal deficit reduction through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Tax increases and expiration of tax cuts are key factors in boosting revenues. Discretionary spending growth is also a factor in the projections, with some alternative scenarios showing a less optimistic fiscal outlook. Some alternative scenarios project a less optimistic fiscal outlook than the CBO baseline, with deficits growing from FY2007 to FY2017. These scenarios include limiting AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending. The deficit would rise from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% in FY2017 under these policies. The CBO analysis of alternative policies projects deficits increasing from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% in FY2017. The Administration's projections differed, with CBO forecasting larger deficits in subsequent years. The CBO projected larger deficits than the Administration for subsequent years, with a small deficit in FY2012. The House and Senate budget resolutions included surpluses in FY2012, with different assumptions about future policy. The conference agreement had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. The difference in surpluses is due to varying assumptions about future policy. Figures show deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017. The data on shares of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006 and estimates for FY2007 through FY2017 are provided by CBO and OMB. The average deficit over 40 years is 2.3% of GDP. The President's policy proposals include increased defense spending, controls on domestic discretionary spending, slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, no additional AMT relief after FY2008, and personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The defense budget for FY2009 only includes minimal costs for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President's policy proposals include increased defense spending, controls on domestic discretionary spending, slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, no additional AMT relief after FY2008, and personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The proposed defense budget only includes a minimal placeholder for war costs in FY2009, with no assumptions for subsequent years. Administration projections show a rapid decline in the deficit as a share of GDP, with a slight surplus in FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections show an improving federal fiscal situation, with deficits falling in proportion to the economy. CBO and OMB deficit projections in Figure 5 extend through FY2017, showing an improving federal fiscal situation with projected deficits falling in proportion to the economy. However, an alternative CBO deficit projection based on different policy assumptions predicts a steady deterioration in fiscal conditions, with the deficit reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. Prominent economists argue that alternative assumptions offer a more realistic view of future fiscal trends. The alternative CBO deficit projection shows a rapid increase from FY2012 to FY2017, reaching 3.6% of GDP. This projection is less optimistic than OMB and CBO baseline projections. OMB, CBO, and GAO all agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable in the long term due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable due to the nation's aging population and rising healthcare costs. This leads to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that spirals out of control. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, according to CBO projections, would lead to an unsustainable fiscal path. The timing of deficits and resulting debt build up varies depending on assumptions used, leading to an unsustainable fiscal path. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in spending other than Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending for these programs is projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP, necessitating significant budget cuts to keep overall spending close to 20% of GDP. The CBO report on the long-term fiscal outlook predicts that spending on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid will reach 15% of GDP by 2030. To maintain overall spending at 20% of GDP, the rest of the budget would need to be cut by more than half. This is due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs creating a growing demand for resources to finance federal mandatory programs. The retirement of the baby-boom generation will lead to a growing demand for resources to finance federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Fiscal stability in the future may require significant spending cuts and possibly higher taxes. The current structure of major entitlement programs poses long-term budget concerns. The Administration has concerns about the long-term budget outlook due to the unsustainable burden of major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. By 2050, spending on these programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, presenting different challenges to the federal government's fiscal position. Projected to be more than 15 percent of GDP, or more than twice as large as spending on all other programs combined, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid present different challenges to the long-term fiscal position of the federal government. Estimates of the long-term fiscal gap between Social Security outlays and revenues are generally smaller than estimates for Medicare. These estimates are sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding productivity growth and interest rates. The long-term fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are also sensitive to changes in medical inflation and unexpected events can impact the short-term budget outlook. The long-term fiscal gap for Medicare and Medicaid is influenced by changes in assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Projections for medical inflation have often been overly optimistic, with unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns affecting short-term budget outlook. Policy, demographics, and healthcare costs will determine the long-term budget outlook, with the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs putting pressure on the federal budget. Without policy changes, these programs could overwhelm the rest of the budget. The rapid expansion of the elderly population eligible for federal programs, coupled with increasing healthcare costs, will strain the federal budget. Without policy changes, these programs could overwhelm the budget and limit the government's flexibility to meet new needs."
