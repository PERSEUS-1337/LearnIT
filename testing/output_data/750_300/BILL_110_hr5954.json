Presumption of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112 is added to title 38, United States Code. This includes diseases incurred or aggravated by service, even without evidence during that period. The diseases must be diagnosed to qualify. The Secretary can presume service connection for diagnosed diseases related to increased exposure to toxic agents during military service, including chemical or biological warfare projects.
