    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Consumers lack standing to enforce provisions of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in US courts. Courts have ruled that consumers lack standing to bring civil action in US courts for enforcing the provision in the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibiting importation of goods made with forced or convict labor. There have been fewer than 40 enforcement actions in the past 80 years due to broad exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. Federal mechanisms exist to prevent and punish such practices. The enforcement actions on record in the past 80 years for tainted goods imported to the US are limited, with fewer than 40 cases. Federal mechanisms to prevent forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in supply chains suffer from scope limitations and lack of information on tainted goods. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act addresses these issues. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if a contractor engages in trafficking or uses forced labor. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows for criminal jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors engaging in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. Executive Order 13126 prohibits the acquisition of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. Federal regulations such as Executive Orders and the National Defense Authorization Act prohibit contractors and their employees from engaging in trafficking-related activities like charging recruitment fees or confiscating passports. Federal regulations (Public Law 112-239) prohibit Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must also maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism. Federal regulations and Executive Orders require Federal contractors and subcontractors to have an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism to prevent trafficking in persons. Congress acknowledges that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor for commercial profit are severe forms of abuse. Forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are severe forms of abuse for commercial profit. Legislation is needed to prevent these practices and provide consumers with information on products free of such labor.
