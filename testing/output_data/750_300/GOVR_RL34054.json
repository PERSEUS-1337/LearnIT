    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. Rules were issued for spectrum allocation, auction process, public safety spectrum use, and the establishment of a public-private partnership for a network. 24 MHz had already been set aside for public safety in the same bandwidth. The FCC proposed setting aside 10 MHz from public safety frequency bands to pair with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum, creating a shared 20 MHz network for nationwide broadband. This decision was based on the need for a network with national coverage to meet public safety requirements. The FCC proposed creating a shared network of 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network to meet public safety needs. Sharing spectrum with commercial users would provide new funding sources and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The FCC proposed a shared network of 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network to enhance public safety. This collaboration would provide new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. A national license for 10 MHz was assigned to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests. The FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests. This license was created from the 24 MHz originally designated for public safety and is administered by a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL). The FCC paired 10 MHz from commercial frequencies with public safety's 10 MHz to form a shared network. The D Block license, intended for commercial use, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, which concluded on March 18, 2008. The D Block license, intended for commercial use, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, which concluded on March 18, 2008. Qualcomm, Inc. placed an opening bid of $472 million but there were no other bidders; consequently, the reserve price of $1.3 billion set by the FCC was not met. The FCC directed the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block in an Order adopted and released on March 20, 2008, stating it is \"in the public interest to provide additional time to consider all options.\" The FCC decided not to re-auction the D Block after only one bidder participated in Auction 73. They initiated a review of rules and proposed new auction rules for the D Block. The FCC prepared a notice of proposed rule-making for the D Block, seeking comments on disposal options. A Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was created with new auction rules, including a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and options for commercial licenses. Public safety associations have requested local public safety networks to manage access to the public. The FCC is considering offering a national license or smaller licenses for the Broadband Licensee. Public safety associations want local networks to manage access to the public safety spectrum, while a national licensee would ensure common standards and interoperability. Congressional discussions are focused on combining public and private spectrum ownership for a national capability. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at DHS are pursuing separate paths for public safety communications support. Congress is considering how to combine public and private spectrum ownership for a national capability, with funding solutions being a major policy consideration. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for public safety communications support. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. An economic stimulus program could include funding for critical infrastructure improvements, including public safety networks. In the current economic situation, funding for improvements to critical infrastructure, including public safety networks, may receive renewed interest. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources, building economies of scale, and accessing additional spectrum. The consensus is to share spectrum and network facilities with the private sector for public safety benefits, including new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The report assumes three key needs for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network. The report assumes three key needs for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network, a source of funds to meet unavoidable costs associated with public safety, and the costs of rebanding as part of the new allocation plan for 700 MHz set forth by the FCC. A source of funds is needed to cover costs related to public safety, such as rebanding and spectrum license administration. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. Commercial partners will use the shared network for consumer services, requiring incentives to meet higher public safety standards. This overlooks the significant demand from businesses for mobile data access and their need for security and reliability. Incentives are needed to build a network meeting public safety standards, despite high demand from businesses for secure and reliable mobile data access. The D Block license failed to attract bids, sparking debates on potential flaws in the auction structure. The D Block license failed to attract bids, sparking debates on potential flaws in the auction structure and possible solutions to assign the license. Discussions include modifying auction rules to eliminate FCC requirements that may have discouraged bidders while maintaining the public-private partnership structure for a public safety broadband network. To meet the goal of an interoperable public safety broadband network, considerations include modifying auction rules to attract bidders and maintaining the public-private partnership structure. This involves eliminating network sharing requirements, allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships, and auctioning the D Block license without public safety requirements. The goal is to attract bidders for a public safety broadband network by eliminating network sharing requirements, empowering public safety to negotiate partnerships independently, and auctioning the D Block license without public safety requirements. This approach assumes collaboration among entities with adequate spectrum capacity and using federal funds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies to build the network. The nationwide public safety interoperability network can be built using federal funds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies, requiring congressional action for authorization. An alternative organizational structure may involve sharing resources with commercial and other spectrum-license holders, also needing congressional approval and potential legislation for the organizational framework. These solutions are not mutually exclusive and can be implemented together. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions for the nationwide public safety interoperability network, including re-auctioning the D Block under new rules. Several proposals combine different elements, and most fall within specific categories. At a hearing on April 15, 2008, all five FCC commissioners affirmed their support for re-auctioning the D Block under new rules to provide a commercial partner for public safety. The FCC intends to increase its oversight role in supervising the public-private partnership, with potential rule changes for the auction including modifications for the winning bidder. The FCC is considering rule changes for the auction of the D Block, which may involve modifying requirements for the winning bidder, such as lowering the reserve price or eliminating penalties for failure to negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement. Other proposals include re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances like costly build-out requirements and network sharing agreements. Some suggestions even include completely eliminating the network sharing agreement. Some proposals suggest re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances like costly build-out requirements and network sharing agreements. Suggestions include eliminating the network sharing agreement entirely to offer the D Block as a commercial license under terms similar to other blocks assigned through Auction 73. It is recommended to use surplus funds from auctions to build a public network. Many suggest reworking the network sharing agreement for potential bidders and re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances. Surplus funds from auctions could be used to build a public safety network, as proposed in the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer using federal funds to meet public safety needs. The FCC Chairman and Commissioner prefer federal funding for a nationwide public safety network. Recommendations using spectrum auction proceeds lack details on fund distribution. The solution proposed involves using private sector funds to build a nationwide interoperable network at 700 MHz for public safety partners to connect to during emergencies. The public-private partnership aims to create an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for public safety partners to connect to during emergencies. State and local agencies would be heavily involved in building and controlling access to their parts of the network, with the commercial partner playing a dominant role. Funding for public safety could come from existing grant programs. The commercial network would collaborate with public safety partners to provide interoperability. Funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs. Multiple commercial partners could be involved in the cooperative organization, with licenses assigned for local markets and rural coverage. Public safety would lead in designing the network and technology decisions. Instead of a single D Block partner, licenses could be assigned to multiple commercial partners for local markets and rural coverage. The public safety partner would lead in network design and technology choices, with the FCC potentially setting standards. Federal funds could be used for network construction through existing DHS programs. The network sharing agreement for the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz would prioritize the commercial partner's competitive position. Federal funds from the Department of Homeland Security could be used for construction. The federal government's role would be minimized, with support through funding. Federal programs might participate as network customers to ensure economic viability. Broad-based participation of public safety agencies would be maintained. To ensure economic viability, federal programs could participate as network customers in a federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization. Funding could come from appropriations or fundraising efforts. The Public Safety Broadband License could remain with the not-for-profit corporation. The FCC may not assign the D Block to public safety, but with Congress's help, a new broadband network for public safety could be created. Funding options include appropriations, fundraising, or a combination of tools. The Public Safety Broadband License could stay with the not-for-profit corporation or be reassigned, with laws and congressional oversight replacing FCC regulations. The FCC, with Congress's assistance, could create a new broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using existing licenses. Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC can only influence outcomes through spectrum band plans, auction rules, and service rules. The FCC is seeking opinions and information on various questions related to this. The FCC can only influence outcomes through spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements without additional authority from Congress. They are seeking opinions and information on various topics related to the Public Safety Broadband License, network sharing agreement, D Block auction, relocation costs, and service rules for providing broadband wireless access for public safety. The FCC is seeking opinions on the Public Safety Broadband License, D Block auction, and network sharing agreements for providing broadband wireless access for public safety. Cyren Call Communications Corporation proposed a $197 million loan secured by projected revenue from spectrum access fees for capital expenditures. Cyren Call Communications Corporation proposed a $197 million loan secured by projected revenue from spectrum access fees for capital expenditures, including building an overlay for network administration and customer care for public safety customers. The FCC is seeking opinions on funding sources for operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF). Amendments by Congress may be needed for the USF, while the TDF was created in 1996 to provide capital through loans. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) was created in 1996 to provide capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through loans or investments. Amendments by Congress may be necessary for the existing statutes authorizing the fund's uses. The FCC has consistently provided auction rules since initiating auctions in 1994. The FCC has consistently provided auction rules since 1994, including financial requirements for bidders, setting aside licenses, and enforcing service rules for advanced wireless services. The FCC establishes auction rules and service rules for licenses, including requirements for license usage within a specific timeframe. For Auction 73, the FCC introduced service rules mandating spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial license holders. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial license holders, creating a public-private partnership for network building. The FCC established rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction to address potential challenges in building and operating a shared network. This partnership includes a Public Safety Broadband Licensee with 10 MHz of spectrum and a commercial partner with a national license for 10 MHz of spectrum. The FCC established rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, involving a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a commercial partner with a national license. The partnership requires compliance with FCC guidelines, approval of contracts by the FCC, oversight of compliance, and resolution of disputes through the FCC. The FCC established rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, involving a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a commercial partner with a national license. Contracts and legal agreements would be approved by the FCC, compliance overseen, and disputes resolved through the FCC or litigation, in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC's Second Report and Order highlights issues for policy makers regarding public safety communications, not covering purely commercial licenses auctioned later. Congress directed the FCC to allocate 24 MHz of spectrum. The FCC was directed by Congress to allocate 24 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band for public safety use as part of the transition from analog to digital television. Planning for public safety use of frequencies at 700 MHz began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The planning for public safety use of frequencies at 700 MHz started in 1997 and ended in 2003 with the final report of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The NCC, a Federal Advisory Committee to the FCC, developed standards for the 700 MHz band and managed licenses through regional committees. The governance for these channels involves 55 Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) coordinated by the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC). The band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz has been revised to include two licensing approaches. The band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz has been revised to create two licensing approaches, with one block designated for narrowband applications and the other for broadband applications. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum. The revised band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz includes two blocks, one for narrowband applications and the other for broadband applications. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum. Financing for networks on narrowband frequencies will come from a mix of local, state, and federal funds. Additionally, 10 MHz of spectrum will be allocated for broadband communications. The revised band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz includes two blocks, one for narrowband applications and the other for broadband applications. Financing for networks on narrowband frequencies will come from a mix of local, state, and federal funds. Spectrum is allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz, with guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. The revised band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz includes two blocks, one for narrowband applications and the other for broadband applications. Guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz are created to prevent interference. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with some costs covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The public safety licensee must meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation to hold the license. The public safety licensee must meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation to hold the license, establishing standards, participating in the Network Sharing Agreement, and ensuring compliance. The cost of building the national network using the spectrum would be covered by its commercial partner, with potential funding from the public sector for system enhancements. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on specific criteria. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on specific criteria such as not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation was formed in anticipation of receiving the public safety license, hiring Cyren Call Communications Corporation as its advisor for negotiations with the D Block licensee. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed by public safety associations in anticipation of receiving the public safety license. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor for negotiations with the D Block licensee. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License, with representation on the Board of Directors consisting of members from named organizations representing public safety. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members and allowed for two at-large members, creating a board of 13 members. The FCC changed the composition of the Broadband Licensee board, adding three representatives from named organizations, eliminating one representative, and increasing the number of at-large members from two to four. Four at-large members were selected jointly by the FCC bureau for Public Safety and Homeland Security and for Wireless Telecommunications. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council was eliminated. The FCC changed the Broadband Licensee board composition, adding three representatives from named organizations and increasing at-large members to four. NPSTC was eliminated due to membership overlap. PSST, as licensee, must file quarterly financial reports with the FCC. The FCC requires PSST, as the selected licensee, to file quarterly financial reports with copies to relevant bureaus. The licensee must meet criteria for incorporation and bylaws as specified in the rules. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure compliance with corporate governance stipulations. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure compliance with corporate governance stipulations, including the right to re-assign commercial licenses if necessary. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign the D Block license if cooperation and progress are unsatisfactory. It can also revoke the license awarded to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee if obligations are not met. The public safety license is valid for ten years and renewable, starting from February 17, 2009. The public safety license awarded by the FCC is valid for ten years, starting from February 17, 2009, and renewable. The licensee must negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner, administer access to the network for public safety users, and represent the interests of its constituents. The licensee must negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner, administer access to the network for public safety users, represent the interests of its constituents, and approve equipment and applications for the network. The licensee has the authority to approve equipment specifications and applications for the network. State and local entities must seek approval before connecting their systems. The licensee coordinates stations accessing frequencies and oversees user relocations. They decide whether federal public safety agencies can access the network and review requests for wideband networks. The licensee oversees frequencies and user relocations, decides on access for federal agencies, reviews wideband network requests, and facilitates negotiations for network sites on public land. The commercial partner for Block D in the public-private partnership is determined by the FCC. Eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 were ruled on by the FCC. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would be entitled to a bidding credit of 15% for companies with average revenues of $40 million in the past three years and 25% for companies with average annual earnings of no more than $15 million. This designation allowed many start-up companies to qualify as designated entities for the D Block. The FCC set a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz in Auction 73, with a presumed value of $1.7 billion based on previous bids. The Telecommunications Bureau recommended setting a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block license in an upcoming auction. The winning bidder would need to meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC required the winning bidder of the D Block license to complete a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee within six months of filing the long form application. Additionally, a separate agreement was needed to grant the Public Safety Broadband Licensee right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets. The NSA for the D Block license required approval by the FCC and included provisions for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to have right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets. The winning bidder had to certify active negotiations within ten days and provide a timetable for the first 30 days of negotiation meetings. The FCC required the winning bidder of the D Block license to file a report certifying active negotiations within ten days and provide a timetable for the first 30 days of negotiation meetings. Detailed monthly reports on negotiations were required after three months, with the FCC able to demand additional reports as needed. Two FCC staff members would act as neutral observers throughout the negotiation process. Another requirement was the formation of separate legal entities to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the network. The FCC staff would be neutral observers during negotiation stages for the D Block license. Separate legal entities must be formed to hold the license, own network assets, and operate the network. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and have a corporate structure that ensures financial independence. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership for the D Block license must have a corporate structure that is \"bankruptcy remote,\" approved by the FCC, and comprised of quasi-independent companies with designated functions. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership for the D Block license must have a corporate structure approved by the FCC, comprised of quasi-independent companies with designated functions. These entities would be subject to the Communications Act and the Commission's rules and regulations, responsible for building out the shared network as specified in agreements and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations or deadlines could result in consequences. The FCC-approved corporate structure for the D Block license must build out the shared network as per agreements and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could lead to license revocation and penalties. License valid for ten years from February 17, 2009. The D Block license holder must pay a penalty of 10% of the auction price for any default. The license is valid for ten years from February 17, 2009, and can be renewed if FCC rules are followed. The commercial corporation formed must build the public safety network using the spectrum held by the public safety licensee and the D Block license holder. The commercial corporation formed as required by the FCC would be fully responsible for building the public safety network, using spectrum held by the public safety licensee and the D Block license holder. The build-out must conform to FCC and specific negotiated requirements with the public safety licensee. Modifications may be allowed with approval from all parties, including the FCC. Population-based build-out benchmarks were set by the FCC, with the first benchmark being four years from February 2009 to reach 75% of the population to be served by the national D Block license. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build-out, with coverage reaching 75% of the population by 2013, 95% by 2016, and 99.3% by 2019. The build-out schedule includes major highways, interstates, and communities with a population over 3,000 to meet FCC's minimum standards. The FCC required the NSA to include a build-out schedule for major highways, interstates, and communities with a population over 3,000 based on U.S. Census data. The D Block licensee had to confirm benchmarks were met, with failure leading to license cancellation. Additionally, a handset with integrated satellite solution had to be offered to improve coverage in rural areas. The D Block licensee must meet benchmarks set by the FCC or risk license cancellation. They are required to offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for rural area coverage and ensure signal robustness for population coverage. The NSA establishes requirements for public safety service, network performance, and reliability. The licensee cannot discontinue or degrade service as per FCC regulations. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) sets requirements for public safety service, network performance, and reliability. The FCC prohibits the D Block licensee from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers without approval. Adherence to the NSA is a regulatory condition for both commercial and public safety licensees. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is crucial for the public-private partnership, serving as the contractual mortar between licensees. The FCC reviews and approves all components of the NSA, setting requirements like network coverage and minimum standards for the network to meet public safety needs. The FCC sets minimum standards for network coverage in the NSA to meet public safety needs, including specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data, interoperability across agencies, and sufficient signal coverage. The evolving technologies for public safety and commercial uses must have specifications ensuring communications interoperability, signal coverage meeting public safety standards, robustness for reliability, capacity for emergency situations, and heavy usage without service degradation. The FCC expects public safety networks to have facilities and towers that can withstand harsh conditions, backup power for extended operations, spectrum efficient technologies, state-of-the-art security measures, and automatic prioritization of public safety communications in real-time based on type and priority levels. State-of-the-art security and encryption technologies. Automatic prioritization of public safety communications in real time, with the highest priorities given to safety of life and property, and homeland security. Operational control of the public safety network by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to ensure public safety requirements are met. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the public safety network to meet safety requirements. They have the right to approve equipment specifications and purchase subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide an integrated handset for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users on the network. The FCC ruled on guidelines and obligations for the Network Sharing Agreement between the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the D Block Licensee. This includes the adoption of a common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability and specifying all service fees in the agreement. The FCC ruled on guidelines for the Network Sharing Agreement between the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the D Block Licensee, including fee structures and duration. Fees for normal network service and priority access to spectrum capacity must be specified in the agreement. The FCC suggested negotiating \"reasonable rates\" in good faith, with financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on the number of public safety sector subscribers. The FCC provided guidelines for a reasonable pricing structure in the Network Sharing Agreement between the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the D Block Licensee. This included financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on the number of public safety sector subscribers and affordable rates priced lower for public safety. The D Block licensee was expected to negotiate fees that best serve public safety goals. The FCC outlined guidelines for pricing in the Network Sharing Agreement between the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the D Block Licensee. The agreement included affordable rates for public safety and tools to resolve disputes over fees. The agreement would be in effect for up to ten years, aligning with the D Block license duration and could be renewed. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) sets pricing guidelines for fees charged, aligning with the D Block license duration of up to ten years. The NSA can be renewed along with the license, with any modifications requiring approval from the FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety and Homeland Security. The NSA agreements in public-private partnerships must be approved by FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety and Homeland Security for major changes. Approval must be obtained before any action, after both licensee partners agree to modifications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary, unconditionally preemptible basis. This allows commercial users on the D Block network to transmit on public safety band frequencies only when there is no demand. The D Block licensee has secondary access to frequencies in the public safety band, allowing commercial users to transmit only when there is no demand from public safety users. This privilege is part of the public-private partnership agreements. The D Block licensee has secondary access to public safety frequencies as part of a public-private partnership. The licensee must lease spectrum to build a network for public safety use, with the responsibility for compliance placed on them for the full ten-year term. The D Block licensee, as part of a public-private partnership, must lease spectrum for public safety use for the full ten-year term. They are responsible for ensuring no interference with public safety users and must prioritize first responders on the network. The FCC requires the network to prioritize first responders automatically, with immediate preemption for commercial users. Public safety has real-time emergency access to the spectrum licensed to the D Block. The definition of an emergency is part of the NSA, and in cases without agreement, public safety prevails. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. This allowed for a shared spectrum agreement between public safety and the private sector, resolving spectrum management issues. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety to accommodate narrowband and broadband networks, allowing for a shared spectrum agreement with the private sector. Key decisions include moving networks in the 700 MHz band, requiring technical adjustments, and capping reimbursement at $10 million for public safety. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band, requiring technical adjustments for network relocation. The D Block licensee must cover costs, with reimbursement capped at $10 million for public safety. New operations of narrowband systems are prohibited, and wideband network building and use are limited. The band plan includes two sets of paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. The new band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band has created two separate sets of paired spectrum blocks. One set is for narrowband communications, while the other is designated for a new broadband network to be built through a public-private partnership. Some states have already started building narrowband networks using the 700 MHz capacity. Modifications will be needed for base stations and radios programmed to operate on frequencies reassigned to the broadband network. Some states are constructing narrowband networks on the 700 MHz capacity, requiring modifications to base stations and radios programmed for frequencies reassigned to broadband. The FCC mandated these frequencies be vacated by February 17, 2009, for immediate broadband use. Motorola provided cost estimates for a rebanding plan proposed by NPSTC, covering existing, ordered, or planned equipment. Motorola provided the FCC with a $9.45 million cost estimate for a rebanding plan proposed by NPSTC, covering existing, ordered, or planned equipment. The FCC decided that the D Block licensee would cover rebanding costs, with a $10 million reimbursement cap to control expenses. Systems and radios in operation 30 days after the Second adoption would be eligible for reimbursement. The FCC established a $10 million cap for rebanding costs, with a cut-off date of August 30, 2007, to limit the number of systems and radios eligible for reimbursement. The estimated cost was around $6 million, based on Motorola's projections, to allow for potential underestimations and ensure costs remained below the cap. The FCC set a $10 million cap for rebanding costs by August 30, 2007, based on Motorola's $6 million estimate. New operations on affected frequencies were prohibited, and rules for cost calculations were established, requiring agreements between public safety and commercial licensees to be approved by the FCC. The FCC established rules for calculating costs and reimbursements related to the Network Sharing Agreement between public safety and commercial D Block licensees. They must reach an agreement on relocation and rebanding costs within 30 days, meeting certain conditions to receive reimbursement. To receive reimbursement, displaced public safety network operators must provide information on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, contact information, and geographical areas of operation. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing necessary changes to equipment. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to handsets, base stations, and equipment. The FCC does not require the licensee to cover costs related to reassigning channels or other changes to Regional Planning Committee plans, but some reimbursement may be possible for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's rebanding program costs. The rule making acknowledges the possibility of reimbursement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs related to the rebanding program. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs not exceeding $10 million for changes necessitated by rebanding. This amount, once approved by the FCC, must be paid into a trust. The FCC requires a relocation plan to be submitted with certification from license holders and equipment vendors agreeing to negotiated prices. The approved amount must be paid into a trust account by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee before the Network Sharing Agreement is executed. The licensee administers the account and makes payments according to the reimbursement schedule, but no payments can be made until the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. The winning bidder for the D Block license must wait until all FCC requirements are met. Public safety network operators need a waiver to operate wideband systems, which must be requested with an application and confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. To operate wideband systems in narrowband channels, a waiver is required. The waiver request must include an application, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed-upon conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and a certification of no reimbursement sought from the D Block licensee for future transition costs. Waivers for wideband operations are only granted within narrowband frequencies, with rare exceptions for broadband frequencies. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks. Licenses for wideband operations will be valid for five years and devices must be interoperable with the broadband network. No wideband operations will be permitted in broadband frequencies except under rare circumstances. The FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks for five years. It extended its authority to regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and companies managing the obligations of the D Block license holder. Congressional oversight of the public-private partnership falls under the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC made a commitment to oversee and adjudicate the operation of service rules for auctions. The FCC has extended its authority to oversee the public-private partnership for a nationwide emergency communications network. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will control a significant asset value, with four board members appointed by the FCC. Congressional committees dealing with telecommunications will have jurisdiction over the partnership. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, governed by its Board of Directors in accordance with FCC regulations, has four voting members appointed by the FCC. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Congress would provide guidance to FCC commissioners. Two bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, governed by its Board of Directors according to FCC regulations, may face enforcement actions such as license revocation under the Communications Act.
