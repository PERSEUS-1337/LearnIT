Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing around $2.7 billion in Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The program aims to improve cost-effectiveness, promote self-sufficiency, and expand housing options for low-income families. The Moving to Work (MTW) program, established in 1996 by Congress, aims to improve cost-effectiveness, promote self-sufficiency, and expand housing options for low-income families. Currently, over 30 PHAs are participating in MTW, managing approximately $2.7 billion in Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher funding and $1.1 billion in public housing funding. The future of MTW is uncertain as the current HUD-PHA agreements are set to expire in 2018, with calls for earlier changes to the program emerging. Critics argue that MTW agencies have been given unprecedented authority. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) program is uncertain as the current HUD-PHA agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics argue that MTW agencies have been given unprecedented flexibilities, with concerns about negative impacts on low-income families. Supporters believe the program allows PHAs to serve more families in unique and cost-effective ways. The Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program has sparked conflicting views among critics and supporters regarding its impact on low-income families. Critics question the effectiveness and efficiency of MTW agencies' policies, while supporters praise the program for allowing PHAs to serve more families in innovative ways. The future of the MTW program is uncertain, with calls to either end, change, or expand the program. The MTW demonstration program's effectiveness and efficiency are difficult to evaluate against statutory goals, leading to conflicting views on its success. Some argue for restructuring to better serve its original purpose, while others believe PHAs have shown success operating outside traditional regulations. The MTW demonstration program has sparked debate about its future, with some advocating for restructuring to improve its effectiveness in providing assisted housing. Others argue that MTW agencies have shown success operating outside traditional regulations, suggesting a potential future for assisted housing programs. Despite the controversy, policies developed by MTW agencies have influenced reforms in mainstream assisted housing programs. The MTW demonstration program has influenced reforms in mainstream assisted housing programs. Policymakers may consider lessons from MTW agencies for future federal housing assistance program reforms. The report provides an overview of the program's history, purpose, policies adopted by participating PHAs, outcomes, and policy options. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program (MTW) was authorized by Congress in the FY1996 omnibus appropriations law. It allows Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. The program's history, purpose, policies, outcomes, and future policy options are discussed in the report. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families outside of HUD's primary programs. The program aims to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices for low-income families. Up to 30 PHAs will be selected through a competitive process to participate in the program. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program aims to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices for low-income families. Up to 30 PHAs will be selected through a competitive process to participate in the program, with the flexibility to develop their own policies to achieve these objectives. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows MTW agencies to develop their own policies for assisted housing, including combining funding streams and waiving statutory requirements. PHAs can design a \"reasonable\" rent policy to promote employment and self-sufficiency. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to create their own rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for participating families. The program also requires PHAs to maintain a certain number and mix of low-income families and meet HUD housing quality standards. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs flexibility in creating rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for low-income families while ensuring compliance with HUD housing quality standards. Additionally, PHAs must guarantee that at least 75% of assisted families are low-income and seek public input in developing their MTW policies. The law prohibits HUD from waiving certain provisions of the U.S. Housing Act related to public housing demolition, labor standards, and community service requirements. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs flexibility in rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for low-income families. PHAs must seek public input in developing their MTW policies and hold a public hearing before submitting an application. The plan detailing how the PHA will use MTW flexibilities must be approved by HUD for participation. MTW agencies must submit annual reports to HUD for monitoring compliance with their plans. The Moving to Work (MTW) program allows PHAs flexibility in rent policies to promote self-sufficiency for low-income families. HUD must approve PHAs' plans to participate in the MTW program and monitor their compliance. MTW agencies must submit annual reports to HUD detailing their use of funds and activities. The MTW program allows agencies to implement various policies and activities within a structured framework. The MTW demonstration program allows agencies to implement diverse policies and activities within a structured framework. The program was developed in response to concerns about rising costs and management issues in public housing during the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers sought strategies to reduce costs and improve public housing management through major reforms. During the 1980s and 1990s, public housing faced social issues, leading federal policymakers to consider reforms to reduce costs and improve management. The concept of \"block granting\" was explored to give local officials more autonomy in housing programs. This influenced the development of the MTW demonstration program. In the 1990s, the concept of \"block granting\" in social programs was being explored, with housing practitioners and federal policymakers considering devolving assisted housing programs to the local level for greater autonomy. Some believed federal regulation was necessary for achieving housing goals like desegregation. Welfare reform debates focused on increasing family self-sufficiency. Tenant advocates believed federal regulation of assisted housing programs was necessary to achieve federal housing goals, such as desegregation. Welfare reform debates in the 1990s focused on increasing family self-sufficiency across social welfare programs, including housing assistance. Federal policymakers and housing practitioners increasingly believed that market-based approaches practiced by private industry would reduce assisted housing costs. The MTW demonstration program allowed for the pursuit of these policy goals while maintaining existing models. The MTW demonstration program, announced by HUD in December 1996, aimed to reduce assisted housing costs through market-based approaches practiced by private industry. 30 PHAs were selected from 43 applicants to participate in the program, entering into individual negotiations with HUD to set the terms of their agreements. The negotiation process was complicated and lengthy. After selecting 30 PHAs for participation in the MTW program, HUD engaged in individual negotiations with each agency to establish the terms of their agreements. The negotiation process, which began in 1998, was complex and time-consuming, with most agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Six of the selected MTW agencies opted out, possibly due to delays in implementation or the increased flexibility provided to all PHAs in 1998 through a housing reform law. In 2000, HUD allocated six open spaces in the MTW program to housing authorities with more than 2,500 units. The program has grown beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs, with additional agencies added through acts of Congress, such as Charlotte and Pittsburgh through P.L. 105-276. The MTW program has expanded beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs, with additional agencies added through acts of Congress. Congress directed HUD to competitively select high-performing PHAs with fewer than 5,000 assisted housing units for participation in MTW. HUD has expanded the MTW program beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs, with additional agencies added through acts of Congress. Currently, 35 PHAs are participating in the MTW demonstration program, with four more agencies selected by HUD pending final agreements. HUD has expanded the MTW program beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs, with currently 35 PHAs participating. Four more agencies have been selected by HUD, pending final agreements. Criticisms of HUD's implementation include selecting PHAs with prior poor performance, lack of uniform program structure leading to varied policies, and data systems limitations. The MTW program faced challenges due to non-uniform program structure, data system limitations, and difficulties in collecting tenant information, hindering HUD's ability to evaluate the program's impact. HUD has faced challenges in evaluating the impact of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and program costs due to data collection issues and program design. Reports on MTW have been process-oriented and lack comparison of policy results. HUD's monitoring of the demonstration's implementation was criticized by the Inspector General, prompting recommendations from the Government Accountability Office to improve monitoring. HUD faced challenges in evaluating the impact of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and program costs. The Inspector General criticized HUD for insufficient monitoring of the program's implementation. In response, HUD executed a standard MTW agreement with participating agencies in 2008, extending their participation until 2018. The agreement introduced uniform language and reporting requirements while still allowing agencies flexibility to develop local policies. The standard MTW agreement introduced uniform language and reporting requirements, extending agencies' participation in the program until 2018. HUD believes this will allow for more systematic evaluation of agencies' policies in the future, but it does not standardize performance data, limiting HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies. HUD has increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with statutory purposes and requirements, including collecting data on tenant characteristics for evaluation of policies. HUD has increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with statutory purposes and requirements, including defining terms like \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice\" and assessing if agencies meet program requirements. HUD has been monitoring MTW agencies' compliance with program requirements, including assessing if agencies serve a comparable mix of low-income families. A 2011 assessment found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income, and most agencies served a similar number of families as before entering the program. The GAO report praised HUD's initiatives for moving in the right direction. The GAO report found that most MTW agencies served a similar number of families as before entering the program, with only one agency serving substantially fewer families. HUD's recent initiatives were praised for moving in the right direction in ensuring compliance with statutory requirements, but the lack of standard definitions and a systematic process hinders effective evaluation of MTW agencies' compliance. The HUD IG report in September 2013 highlighted that despite some improvements in oversight, the department still struggled to ensure agencies' compliance with the statute. HUD's oversight of MTW agencies' compliance with statutory requirements has been criticized by the HUD IG report in September 2013. The report recommended that HUD should not add any new MTW agencies until its administration of the program improved. MTW agencies have implemented a variety of program activities, with some making significant transformations to their assisted housing programs. MTW agencies have adopted a wide range of program activities, with some fully transforming their assisted housing programs while others have made more modest policy changes. They have applied their MTW policies to all assisted households or subsets of their populations. The following section describes three policy areas where MTW agencies have discretion and provides examples of their developed policies. The section discusses three policy areas where MTW agencies have discretion: merging funding streams, level of assistance, and administrative flexibilities. Policies may vary due to program scope and scale, with examples of policy changes over time noted. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge their federal funding streams into a block grant, departing from the standard set of assisted housing funding streams. The report does not evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. MTW agencies have the option to combine their federal funding streams into a block grant, deviating from the usual individual funding streams for assisted housing programs. This allows for more flexibility in how the funds are used across different programs. Under the non-merged funding structure, Section 8 voucher funding is limited to landlord payments and cannot be used for PHA administration or other housing development plans. MTW block grant assistance is negotiated rather than determined by traditional formulas, with the majority of MTW PHAs now opting for merged assistance funding. MTW agencies receive grant assistance through negotiated agreements, allowing flexibility in funding usage. Initially, only six agencies opted for merged funding, but now the majority do. A 2004 report showed limited use of this flexibility, mainly to address financial shortfalls and for approved cross-program purposes. MTW agencies used merged funding flexibility to address financial shortfalls and for cross-program purposes approved by HUD. Officials believed this autonomy encouraged alternative fund uses, such as developing support services for tenant self-sufficiency. MTW agencies utilized funding flexibility to create autonomy from regulatory processes, enabling alternative uses of funds. This included developing support services for tenant self-sufficiency and leveraging financing for additional low-income housing units. More agencies are now opting for block grant funding. MTW agencies, like the Chicago Housing Authority and the Atlanta Housing Authority, have used block grant funding to develop additional low-income housing units and undertake significant redevelopment of their public housing stock. The Chicago Housing Authority and the Atlanta Housing Authority have used their MTW flexibility to redevelop public housing stock. Chicago attracted private investment for its \"Plan for Transformation\" by replacing deteriorating housing with new developments in mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream was crucial in securing financing from private investors. The Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority utilized their MTW flexibility to revamp public housing stock, attracting private investment for redevelopment in mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream played a key role in securing financing from private investors, enabling projects like revenue bond financing in Chicago and replacement of distressed housing in Atlanta. Other MTW agencies, such as Keene Housing Authority and Housing Authorities of Santa Clara and San Jose, also leveraged funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based. The Keene Housing Authority and other MTW agencies have used funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments, attracting additional financing. This approach allows for leveraging outside funding not typically available in traditional public housing. The interest in converting public housing developments into new forms of assistance is driven by leveraging additional outside financing, which is limited in traditional public housing. Project-basing of vouchers is more widely used by MTW PHAs than non-MTW PHAs, allowing a PHA to reserve a portion of a building for low-income tenants by attaching vouchers to the reserved units. In the traditional voucher program, PHAs can \"project-base\" vouchers by reserving units for low-income tenants with a limit of 20% of vouchers and 25% of units in a private building. MTW agencies have more flexibility to waive these restrictions and convert public housing developments. MTW agencies have the flexibility to waive restrictions in the traditional voucher program, allowing them to convert public housing developments and project-base units in various ways, such as converting public housing stock to project-based vouchers or serving special populations in entire buildings. MTW agencies have the flexibility to project-base entire buildings to serve special populations, with the majority either currently using or planning to use project-based voucher assistance. This rate is much higher than non-MTW PHAs, with only about 15% of all PHAs engaged in project-basing vouchers according to a 2010 HUD report. MTW agencies have the flexibility to project-base entire buildings to serve special populations, with a higher rate of project-basing than non-MTW PHAs. Until 2011, MTW agencies had full discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures. In 2011, HUD issued guidance that MTW agencies must determine tenant eligibility based on statutory income calculation, removing discretion for alternative income calculations. Compliance with new guidance for agencies with approved alternative income calculations is unclear. MTW agencies no longer have discretion to use alternative income calculations but can still implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Industry groups representing PHAs have raised concerns about the new statutory income calculations and rent structures for public housing and Section 8 programs. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures for tenants, aiming to simplify administration and encourage income growth through work. Industry groups representing PHAs have raised concerns about the complexity of current income calculations and rent structures in public housing and Section 8 programs. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures to simplify administration and encourage income growth through work. This includes limiting income exclusions and deductions, and not including income derived from assets below a certain threshold value. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold. Over half of participating agencies in 2011 used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. There is uncertainty about the future of these policies due to recent HUD guidance. Most MTW agencies have experimented with reducing the frequency of verifying tenants' income, especially for those with fixed incomes like the elderly or disabled. Some agencies only reexamine income every two or three years and may eliminate interim reexaminations. 88% of MTW agencies are implementing these changes. Some MTW agencies have adopted alternate schedules for recertifying tenant income, potentially forgoing additional revenue or increasing subsidy costs. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown due to a lack of data. Some MTW agencies have adopted alternate schedules for recertifying tenant income, potentially forgoing additional revenue or increasing subsidy costs. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown due to a lack of data. Under traditional housing assistance programs, tenants pay a percentage of their income towards rent, with flexibility for PHAs to set minimum rent policies. As tenants' incomes change, their rents and subsidies adjust accordingly. MTW agencies have experimented with various rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, stepped rents, and alternative subsidies. These changes allow for adjustments in rent based on tenant income levels. MTW agencies have implemented different rent structures such as minimum rents, tiered rents, and flat rents. Some agencies have simplified utility calculations for determining tenant subsidies. Some MTW agencies have implemented alternative rent structures to encourage work and mimic the private market. Officials believe these structures are easier for tenants to understand and for staff to administer. MTW agencies have adopted alternative rent structures to mimic the private market, making it easier for tenants and staff. However, there is a lack of data to evaluate the impact on tenant earnings and administrative work. Some MTW PHAs have implemented new requirements for tenants, such as time limits and work requirements, to promote self-sufficiency and serve more families. Data on the outcomes of these changes is lacking. MTW agencies have implemented work requirements and time limit policies to promote self-sufficiency and serve more families. These policies vary in their specifications, with time limits ranging from three to seven years. Supportive services are often provided to families subject to these requirements. MTW agencies have implemented work requirements and time limit policies to promote self-sufficiency. Time limits for program participation range from three to seven years. Additional policies streamline operations without changing the level of assistance families receive, such as alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements. MTW agencies have adopted policies to streamline operations without altering the level or type of assistance families receive, such as alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program requires annual inspections to ensure units meet HUD's standards, but industry groups argue that the current requirements demand high staff resources and may not always be necessary. Some MTW agencies have adopted alternative inspection schedules, like risk-based inspections, to address concerns about high staff resources required for annual unit inspections. This approach includes less frequent inspections for landlords with good records and self-certification of units. Some MTW agencies have implemented risk-based inspection schedules, allowing landlords with good records to have less frequent inspections and self-certify units under certain conditions. HUD's 2010 Report to Congress emphasizes the importance of ensuring that assisted housing meets federal housing quality standards. Some MTW agencies are conducting inspections less frequently and allowing owners to self-certify under certain conditions. The MTW program requires agencies to ensure housing meets federal quality standards. HUD's 2010 Report suggests alternative inspection procedures have maintained quality in a cost-effective manner, but a full evaluation is needed to compare effectiveness with regulated procedures for Section 8 voucher-assisted rental units. The effectiveness of alternative HQS inspection procedures for Section 8 voucher-assisted rental units compared to traditional inspection procedures needs further evaluation. MTW agencies vary in how they report program information to HUD due to the different accountability structure of the MTW demonstration program. MTW agencies differ in reporting program information to HUD. They submit an Annual MTW Plan and Report, while non-MTW agencies have more prescriptive plans focused on meeting federal rules. MTW reporting requirements are believed to encourage accountability. MTW officials believe that MTW reporting requirements promote program creativity and strategic planning, leading to activities that may not have been attempted otherwise. Other assisted housing program reporting requirements are seen as mere obligations. Since the implementation of the standard MTW agreement in 2008, MTW agencies must now include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval. This change allows HUD to have more knowledge of MTW agencies' activities and their outcomes. Since the 2008 agreement, MTW agencies must include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval. This change gives HUD more insight into MTW agencies' activities and outcome measurement. However, GAO noted that the current reporting process allows MTW agencies to self-report on program outcomes without verification. Some agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements after not reporting activities for up to 11 years. HUD's reporting systems still lack capacity to accept certain data. HUD has reported that some MTW agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements after not reporting on activities for up to 11 years. Several of HUD's reporting systems lack capacity to accept data on MTW-specific activities. There has been no systematic evaluation of the outcomes of the policies adopted by MTW agencies in achieving program goals. Despite the lack of verified evidence, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD suggest that the Moving to Work program has impacted tenants and PHAs' operations, informing policy debates about its future. HUD aims to standardize the program and improve data collection for a more systematic evaluation in the future. Tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD have observed the impact of the Moving to Work program on tenants and PHAs' operations, influencing policy debates. Concerns have been raised about the negative effects on assisted housing tenants. HUD has suggested that the Moving to Work program has allowed participating PHAs to offer more assisted housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. The impact of the program on tenants has raised concerns among advocates, PHAs, and HUD. The Moving to Work program has allowed PHAs to offer more assisted housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, concerns have been raised about the impact on tenants, as some agencies may be reducing assistance to current recipients. Some PHAs have implemented policies to reduce rental assistance for tenants, potentially impacting low-income individuals. MTW agencies' self-sufficiency programs may benefit families in the long term, but concerns exist about needy families losing access to assistance due to time limits and work requirements. Reports suggest MTW agencies have limited tenants' portability. The MTW demonstration program has raised concerns about needy families losing access to assistance, limited tenants' portability, and led to the demolition of public housing in some communities, impacting tenants' lives significantly. Further research is needed to determine the overall benefit of MTW discretion for low-income individuals. The MTW demonstration program allows flexibility for low-income individuals receiving assistance, leading to the demolition of public housing in some communities. Atlanta and Chicago PHAs, as MTW agencies, have demolished most of their public housing stock, replacing some with vouchers and mixed-income housing. MTW agencies like Atlanta and Chicago have demolished much of their public housing stock, replacing it with vouchers and mixed-income developments. This strategy has faced criticism from tenant advocates who argue that it disrupts communities and makes social services less accessible. The HOPE VI program funded the demolition or redevelopment of severely distressed public housing, including that owned by MTW agencies. Research by the Urban Institute showed mostly positive outcomes for tenants displaced from such housing. Research by the Urban Institute on the outcomes of HOPE VI shows positive results for tenants displaced from severely distressed public housing. While most tenants now live in lower-poverty neighborhoods with improved health outcomes, some vulnerable groups may require additional services for housing revitalization benefits. Some vulnerable groups, such as large families, those with disabilities, and facing multiple barriers to self-sufficiency, may not benefit as much from public housing revitalization and may need extra services. While data is limited on the cost-effectiveness of MTW agencies, supporters believe the program has been successful. Renewal of participation by most PHAs and interest from others indicate support for the program. Supporters of the MTW program, including PHA industry groups, some housing practitioners, and Members of Congress, believe in its success. Most PHAs renew their participation, showing popularity. Congress supports the program by expanding participation. HUD officials suggest MTW agencies are cost-effective in housing administration. Some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies may not be as cost-effective as believed. They suggest that MTW agencies may actually administer assisted housing at a higher cost than non-MTW agencies, impacting funding for other PHAs in a limited funding environment. Some advocates argue that MTW agencies may be less cost-effective, potentially impacting funding for other PHAs in a limited funding environment. Supporters claim that increased discretion for MTW agencies reduces administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. Supporters of Moving to Work (MTW) argue that the increased discretion given to MTW agencies reduces administrative burdens without raising oversight risks. Unlike traditional housing programs, MTW agencies are not held accountable through regulatory structures, allowing them to focus on outcomes rather than processes. This lack of regulatory oversight may be seen as a way to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Moving to Work (MTW) agencies focus on outcomes rather than processes, defining their own goals and self-reporting effectiveness to HUD. Supporters argue this allows for innovative strategies and long-term planning, while industry groups see it as a case for deregulation and moving away from traditional oversight. The Moving to Work (MTW) program allows agencies to pursue innovative strategies and focus on program outcomes. However, there are concerns about the monitoring of program funds and the future of the MTW demonstration is uncertain. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program is uncertain, with proposals to either expand it into a permanent program or phase it out and replace it with targeted demonstrations. HUD will decide whether to renew agreements for the program set to expire in 2018. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program is uncertain, with proposals to either expand it into a permanent program or phase it out and replace it with targeted demonstrations. Critics have called for more meaningful evaluations to inform future policy changes. Policymakers are debating whether the MTW program should be a testing ground for reforming rental assistance programs or if some version of it is the future of assisted housing. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) program is uncertain, with proposals to expand it into a permanent program or phase it out. Policymakers are debating whether the program should be a testing ground for rental assistance reform or if it is the future of assisted housing. Policymakers may consider changing the MTW program to make it more effective, turning it into a permanent program, or maintaining the status quo. The program aims to design and test various approaches for providing housing assistance. The MTW demonstration program aims to test different approaches for providing housing assistance, with goals of reducing costs, promoting work and self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. The program's effectiveness has been limited due to its design and implementation. The MTW demonstration program has limitations in achieving its goals due to its design and implementation. Some suggest changes to allow it to better serve research-oriented purposes. Some propose changes to the MTW program to enhance its research-oriented purposes. HUD has suggested expanding the program to 60 agencies for a systematic evaluation, including a more targeted selection for studying specific policies. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for a systematic evaluation, focusing on selecting high-performing agencies capable of rigorous evaluation. The goal is to assess policies for potential national adoption. Similar proposals are found in housing reform legislative acts. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for a systematic evaluation of policies for potential national adoption. This proposal aligns with housing reform legislative acts. The MTW compromise allowed for the creation of a new, block grant program. The MTW compromise was a result of policymakers wanting to transform rental assistance programs into a flexible block grant program. It created a new housing program for some PHAs while maintaining existing programs for others. The program has expanded beyond its original scope, with many PHAs now seeking MTW status. Calls have been made to make MTW a permanent program through legislation like the Moving to Work Charter Program Act. The desirability of MTW for PHAs has led to calls to expand and make MTW a permanent program. Legislation like the Moving to Work Charter Program Act aims to increase the number of PHAs eligible for MTW and make it a permanent program. Calls have also been made for block granting and deregulating federal housing assistance for all PHAs, similar to MTW. The Bush Administration proposed the Housing Assistance for Needy Families program in 2004, modeled on MTW, to convert housing assistance into a block grant for PHAs. Concerns were raised about potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections with deregulation. The Bush Administration proposed the Housing Assistance for Needy Families program in 2004, modeled on MTW, to convert housing assistance into a block grant for PHAs. Concerns were raised about potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections with deregulation. Tenant advocates raised concerns about policies that could raise rents and subject tenants to unreasonable conditions. HUD expressed concerns about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW demonstration program. Some PHAs admitted to the current program were considered poor performers prior to entering. The Housing Assistance for Needy Families program proposed in 2004, modeled on MTW, could be raised again. HUD has concerns about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW program, recommending selection based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. High performers are more likely to succeed in meeting reporting requirements. HUD recommends selecting PHAs for the MTW program based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program would be suitable for small PHAs. Policymakers could choose to maintain the current MTW program structure. Existing MTW agencies have agreements through 2018, with possible extensions. The MTW program may continue as is, with existing agencies having agreements through 2018. Congress could add a few more agencies, and HUD has made some changes to address critics' concerns. HUD has made changes to address critics' concerns about the MTW program, including increasing reporting requirements and standardizing agreements. Participating PHAs are experimenting with new policies that could impact assisted housing programs. Both HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Obama Administration and Members of Congress have proposed changes to HUD rental assistance. Both HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Changes proposed include inspection rules, income calculation rules, and rent policies. Obama Administration and Members of Congress support these changes to HUD rental assistance programs. Changes proposed include biennial inspections, changes to income calculation rules allowing alternate sources of documentation, streamlined rent policies with higher minimum rents, expanded authority for PHAs to \"voucher-out\" public housing, and blending of operating and capital funding for PHAs. Some reforms based on the MTW demonstration have bipartisan support, but controversial policies remain regarding the amount of assistance provided to residents and placing conditions. Some reforms based on the MTW demonstration have bipartisan support, but controversial policies remain regarding the amount of assistance provided to residents and placing conditions like time limits and work requirements. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the effects of these policies on tenant outcomes."
