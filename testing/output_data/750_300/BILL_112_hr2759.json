SHORT TITLE, ETC.\" The Act may be cited as the \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act.\" Congress finds that in 2010, the Department of Labor identified goods made by forced labor and child labor from 70 countries. The United States is the largest importer, and there is a growing demand for information on human rights impacts of products. California enacted the first State law in 2010 requiring public disclosure by manufacturers and retail companies. Civil society demands information on human rights impact of products in the US market. California enacted a law in 2010 requiring disclosure of policies to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in supply chains. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits goods made with forced labor, with exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importation of goods made with forced labor or convict labor, with exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. Courts have ruled that consumers cannot bring civil actions for enforcement of this provision, resulting in few enforcement actions in the past 80 years. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 aimed to protect American manufacturers from unfairly priced goods, not consumers from tainted products. There have been fewer than 40 enforcement actions in the past 80 years. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking in commerce face similar limitations in scope and providing information on tainted goods' specific suppliers. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as egregious forms of exploitation. The Sense of Congress is that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are severe forms of abuse for profit, and legislation is needed to prevent tainted goods from entering the US market. Legislation is necessary to prevent goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US market. Businesses can help by providing transparent information to consumers and investors, responding to their demands rather than just following government regulations. SEC. 2.
