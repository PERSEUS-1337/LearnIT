    "content": "The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes an excise tax on corporations with low-wage employees under a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes a tax on applicable employers who employ low-wage employees based on the aggregate amount of wages paid during the calendar year. The term \"applicable employer\" refers to those required to make tax deposits under chapters 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. The term 'applicable employer' refers to any employer required to make tax deposits under chapters 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code for periods exceeding 180 days in the previous calendar year, excluding governmental entities, churches, and qualified church organizations. The term 'applicable employer' excludes governmental entities, churches, and qualified church organizations. Aggregation rules from section 414 apply, with a substitution in the percentage threshold. A 'low-wage employee' is also defined. In subsections (b) and (c), 'more than 80 percent' is replaced with 'more than 50 percent'. A 'low-wage employee' is defined as someone earning less than 218 percent of the Federal poverty line. The text chunk discusses the definition of a 'low-wage employee' as someone earning less than 218 percent of the Federal poverty line. Rules similar to section 36B(d)(3)(B) apply for this definition. The text chunk explains how the amount for an applicable taxpayer is reduced if they were not an employee for the entire calendar year. The reduction is based on the ratio of weeks not employed to 52. The applicable percentage is determined for subsection (a) in a specific manner. The applicable employee ratio determines the applicable percentage for an employer with low wages: 25% or less = 25%, greater than 25% but not more than 50% = 50%, greater than 50% but not more than 75% = 75%, greater than 75% = 100%. The low-wage employee ratio is calculated as the percentage of low-wage employees to total employees for an employer. This ratio determines the applicable percentage for employers with low wages. The applicable percentage for employers with low wages may be reduced by 25 percentage points if certain requirements are met, including offering benefits to all full-time low-wage employees. The applicable employer can reduce the percentage points by 25 for low-wage employees if specific requirements are fulfilled, such as offering benefits to all full-time low-wage employees. The employer must provide an eligible health plan with a minimum of 60% coverage of allowed costs, and the employee's contribution should not exceed a certain percentage. The employee's contribution to the health plan must not exceed a certain percentage of their annual wages paid by the employer and must meet retirement plan requirements for low-wage employees. The retirement plan requirements for low-wage employees include eligibility to participate in applicable eligible retirement plans maintained by the employer, meeting the percentage in effect under section 36B(c)(2)(B)(II) for the plan year. The retirement plan requirements for low-wage employees involve eligibility to participate in applicable eligible retirement plans maintained by the employer for a plan year ending within the calendar year. The term 'applicable eligible retirement plan' refers to a defined contribution plan requiring employer contributions of at least 5% of the employee's compensation or a defined benefit plan with employer-derived accrued benefits. A defined benefit plan must provide an annual retirement benefit not less than 2% multiplied by the employee's years of service with the employer or 20. The defined benefit plan must provide an annual retirement benefit based on the employee's years of service and final average pay, meeting specific interest credit requirements. The defined benefit plan must meet interest credit requirements and ensure the employee receives a pay credit of at least 5% of compensation for the plan year. The defined benefit plan must meet interest credit requirements and ensure the employee receives a pay credit of at least 5% of compensation for the plan year. Definitions and special rules apply, including the definition of an eligible retirement plan. The term \"account or annuity\" in the defined benefit plan only includes a simplified employee pension. Final average pay is determined based on the highest compensation over a consecutive period of up to 5 years. The Secretary may establish regulations for alternative plan designs for applicable employers. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for applicable employers to meet compensation requirements through a combination of defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Plans must meet requirements without considering social security contributions and benefits. Plans must meet requirements without taking into account social security and similar contributions and benefits. Certain employees may be excluded based on age criteria. Certain employees may be excluded from meeting plan requirements based on age and service criteria. Employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement or described in section 410(b)(3)(C) may be excluded from meeting plan requirements. Employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement or described in section 410(b)(3)(C) may be excluded from meeting plan requirements. Definitions and special rules regarding wages and tax allocation are provided in the section. The Secretary will allocate the tax among entities treated as a single employer. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. Chapter 37 of the Act introduces the Corporate Responsibility Tax. The amendments will be effective for calendar years starting after the enactment date of the Act."
