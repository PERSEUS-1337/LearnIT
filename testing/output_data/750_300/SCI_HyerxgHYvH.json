Eight fundamental operations are identified and learned using feed forward neural networks. In this work, 8 fundamental operations for solving arithmetic problems are identified and learned using feed forward neural networks. These operations are then reused to create larger networks capable of solving more complex arithmetic tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. The approach allows for generalization to computations involving up to 7 digit numbers. Our approach involves using a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to solve arithmetic problems, including n-digit multiplication, n-digit division, and cross product. This strategy promotes reusability and generalization for computations with up to 7 digit numbers, including both positive and negative numbers. The success of ANNs lies in their ability to learn from training data and develop internal structures suitable for specific tasks, although generalization remains a common challenge. The learning process in artificial neural networks (ANNs) relies on the data provided during training, but they often struggle with generalization, leading to performance degradation on unseen data. Techniques like Domain Adaptation can help address these issues, but the behavior suggests that ANNs primarily rely on memorization for learning. The learning process in artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggles with generalization issues, relying primarily on memorization rather than understanding inherent rules. This lack of quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction hinders their decision-making process, unlike other intelligent beings that possess numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Children can memorize single digit arithmetic operations and extrapolate to higher digits, showing the ability to generalize by reusing memorized examples. Complex operations are combinations of simple functions, highlighting the importance of understanding and reusing memorized information for numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning. The key to generalization in arithmetic operations lies in understanding and reusing memorized examples. Complex operations are combinations of simple functions, and by identifying fundamental operations, one can develop quantitative reasoning among ANNs. In this work, fundamental arithmetic operations are identified and learned using neural networks to solve various problems like n-digit multiplication and division. This approach offers a generalized solution for arithmetic operations, unlike existing methods. This work proposes a complex neural network solution for arithmetic operations like n-digit multiplication and division, including both positive and negative numbers. Unlike previous methods, this approach offers a generalized solution and utilizes the ability of neural networks to approximate mathematical functions. Neural networks can approximate mathematical functions, with recent works focusing on generalizing over minimal training data using various architectures like Resnet, highway networks, and dense networks. Recent works such as Resnet, highway networks, and dense networks aim to train networks that can generalize over minimal training data. EqnMaster uses generative recurrent networks for arithmetic functions, but struggles with generalization beyond 3-digit numbers. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) by Trask et al. (2018) represents numerical quantities using linear activations. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) by Trask et al. (2018) uses linear activations to represent numerical quantities and predict arithmetic function outputs. However, extrapolation issues persist in end-to-end learning tasks. A simple Feed Forward Network by Franco & Cannas (1998) can solve arithmetic expressions, including multiplication, but may not be the most efficient network architecture. Issues in end-to-end learning tasks persist, with simple Feed Forward Networks like Franco & Cannas (1998) being inefficient for solving arithmetic expressions. Optimal Depth Networks, as proposed by Siu & Roychowdhury (1992), use binary logic gates for efficient arithmetic function computation, inspired by digital circuits. Research on neural network architecture inspired by digital circuits, such as Digital Sequential Circuits by Ninomiya & Asai (1994), has been explored. Neural networks inspired by digital circuits, like Binary Multiplier Neural Networks, can predict outputs for arithmetic functions on binary digits. This approach builds on research using binary logic gates for efficient arithmetic computation. We propose a network that can predict the output of arithmetic functions on both positive and negative decimal integers using multiple smaller networks for different sub tasks, unlike existing models that only work on limited digits positive integers. We propose training smaller networks for different sub tasks in arithmetic operations like signed multiplication, division, and cross product. By combining these networks, we can perform complex tasks and generalize solutions from 1 digit to n-digit arithmetic operations. The text discusses a loop unrolling strategy for generalizing arithmetic operations from 1 digit to n-digit, using digital circuits for accurate calculations. Initial work has shown neural networks can simulate these circuits. Neural networks can simulate digital circuits for arithmetic operations in computing equipment. n-digit multiplication involves 1-digit multiplication, addition, place value shifter, and sign calculator. Division requires subtraction in addition to multiplication. Six neural networks were designed for fundamental operations. The text discusses the design of neural networks for performing fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, place value shifting, and sign calculation. Complex functions like multiplication and division can be achieved by combining these basic operations. The text discusses how basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction can be implemented in neural networks using simple functions like multiplication and division. The design involves using neurons with specific weights to perform these operations efficiently. The addition and subtraction modules in the neural network are implemented using single neurons with specific weights. The shift-and-add multiplication process involves multiplying digits from right to left and combining the outputs. Place value shifter is used to position the output correctly for addition to obtain the final result. The shift-and-add multiplication process involves multiplying digits from right to left and combining the outputs using a place value shifter. This module uses fixed weights for each preceding digit and can handle n inputs with 1 digit each. The network uses fixed weights for each preceding digit in 1-digit integer multiplication, with two input neurons, 1 hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons. It computes the absolute value of a single number using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The model uses a neural network with 2 hidden layers to compute the absolute value of a single number. It includes operations like x + x, x \u2212 x, and maxpooling to produce the final output. Additionally, an input sign calculator neuron is used to determine the sign of the input number. The output of maxpool layer is represented as max(x + x, x \u2212 x) \u2212 x. An input sign calculator neuron extracts the sign of an input number using the activation function x/(1 + mod(x)). The output sign calculator computes the sign of the result from a multiplication or division of two numbers using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The neural network model uses 2 hidden layers to calculate the sign of the result from a complex operation like multiplication or division. The process involves adding two numbers, applying modulus as an activation function, and subtracting 1. The network takes input sign and magnitude, passes them through 10 neurons in a hidden layer, and uses soft-sign activation in the output layer to predict the sign multiplication result. The neural network model utilizes 2 hidden layers to determine the sign of the output from operations like multiplication or division. It involves converting numbers to positive integers, performing multiplication using various operations, and calculating the sign of the result. The neural network model uses hidden layers to determine the sign of the output from operations like multiplication. Numbers are converted to positive integers, multiplied using a multiply sub module, and the sign of the result is calculated. The neural network model utilizes hidden layers to determine the sign of the output from multiplication operations. The process involves single digit multiplication of tokens from the multiplicand and multiplier, with results combined to form a single number. The final output is assigned a sign using 1-digit sign multiply. The architecture for multiplication operations involves single digit multiplication of tokens from the multiplicand and multiplier, with results combined to form a single number. The final output is assigned a sign using 1-digit sign multiply. The division model separates the sign and magnitude during pre-processing, inspired by the long division model. The architecture for division involves separating the sign and magnitude during pre-processing. It is inspired by the long division model, where a n-digit divisor controls the output computation by multiplying with single digit multipliers and subtracting from selected n-digit chunks of the dividend. Additional layers are introduced to select the smallest non-negative integer as the output, representing the remainder and quotient result of division for the selected chunk. The quotient is combined over all iterations, and the remainder is carried over to the next digit in the divisor. The architecture for division involves separating the sign and magnitude during pre-processing. The selected node represents the remainder and quotient result of division for the selected chunk of n-digit dividend and n-digit divisor. The quotient is combined over all iterations, and the remainder is knitted to the next digit available in the divisor. The division model is based on digital circuitry for decimal digits as shown in Algorithm 2. Comparisons are made with signed arithmetic operations. The study compares the results of signed arithmetic operations using different architectures. The Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU) implementation is trained to match claimed results and tested on a prediction dataset. The model's generalization is tested on integers ranging from 2-digit to 7-digit numbers. Experiment 1 shows that our model outperforms recurrent and discriminative networks, achieving 100% accuracy even within the testing range of the dataset. The signed multiplication capability is exclusive to our model. Experiment 2 compares our model with others.

Experiment 2 compares our results with the state-of-the-art Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU) model for arithmetic operations on positive integer values. The NALU network fails drastically outside the range of 10-20. In this experiment, the NALU network is trained between the range of 10-20, showing drastic failure outside this range. Results of the comparison with the division architecture proposed in the paper are shown in Table 2. The paper demonstrates that complex tasks can be divided into smaller sub-tasks, sharing similar sub-tasks, instead of training a complex end-to-end neural network. In this paper, it is shown that complex tasks can be divided into smaller sub-tasks, which share similar operations. Instead of training a single complex neural network, multiple smaller networks can be trained independently to accomplish specific operations. These fundamental operations, such as arithmetic operations, are then learned using simple feed-forward networks. The study identifies fundamental operations commonly used in arithmetic tasks and trains smaller neural networks to learn these operations. These smaller networks are then combined to create larger, more complex networks for tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. One limitation is the use of float operation in the tokenizer, which hinders end-to-end training of complex networks.
