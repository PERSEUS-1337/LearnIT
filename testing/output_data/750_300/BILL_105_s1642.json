    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that there are over 600 different Federal financial assistance programs, some of which have duplicative or conflicting administrative requirements, hindering cost-effective service delivery at the local level. State, local, and tribal governments, along with nonprofit organizations, are facing increasingly complex problems that require coordinated services. The Congress acknowledges the need for streamlining Federal financial assistance programs to improve service delivery at the local level. The purposes of this Act are to improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify application and reporting requirements, enhance service delivery to the public, and promote greater coordination among service providers. In this Act, the term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \"Federal agency\" means any agency defined under section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \"Federal financial assistance\" has the same meaning as defined in section 7501(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code. The term \"non-Federal entity\" refers to a State, local government, or nonprofit organization. A \"nonprofit organization\" is defined as any corporation, trust, association, cooperative, or other organization. A nonprofit organization is defined as a corporation, trust, association, cooperative, or other organization operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest, not organized primarily for profit, and uses net proceeds to maintain, improve, or expand operations.

The term \"State\" includes various regions and governmental entities, while \"tribal government\" refers to Indian Tribal Governments.
