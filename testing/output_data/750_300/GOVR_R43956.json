    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides cash benefits to individuals who participated in atomic weapons testing or worked in the uranium industry between 1942 and 1971. Claimants must have contracted specified medical conditions after possible exposure to ionizing radiation. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides cash benefits to individuals who were exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry. The program is administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and has approved over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits. The majority of claims are related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The RECA program has approved over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. All benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will sunset. On July 16, 1945, the United States conducted the first atomic bomb test at the Trinity Test Site in New Mexico, leading to the development and testing of atomic weapons until 1992. The majority of the 1,054 tests were done at the Nevada Test Site. The Department of Energy conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests, with 928 tests at the Nevada Test Site. 828 were underground tests and 100 were atmospheric tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. These tests were the only atmospheric atomic weapons tests conducted in the continental United States and Alaska. The Nevada Test Site conducted 100 atmospheric atomic weapons tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest test, the Hood Test in 1957, had an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The RECA program offers $75,000 to onsite participants. The RECA program provides benefits to individuals affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site in 1962. Onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers are eligible for one-time lump sum payments of $75,000, $50,000, and $100,000 respectively. These payments are not adjusted for changes in wages or the cost of living. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments to individuals affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site in 1962. Eligible groups include onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers, who can receive $75,000, $50,000, and $100,000 respectively. These payments are not adjusted for changes in wages or the cost of living and are not subject to federal income tax. However, benefits may be reduced by payments from lawsuits, workers' compensation, or the Department of Veterans Affairs for related illnesses or injuries. No medical or other benefits are provided by the RECA program. Veterans Affairs (VA) does not provide medical benefits under the RECA program, but uranium workers eligible for RECA can receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits through the EEOICPA. Each qualified onsite participant, downwinder, or uranium worker is entitled to one benefit payment, which is paid directly to the claimant if they are living. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) provides benefits to qualified onsite participants, downwinders, or uranium workers under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). If the claimant is living, the benefit is paid directly to them. If deceased, the benefit is paid to eligible survivors in a specific order of precedence: spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents. Only these survivors are eligible for RECA benefits. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements by being present onsite during an atmospheric atomic weapons test conducted by the United States. Eligible survivors for RECA benefits are listed in a specific order of precedence: spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents. Only these survivors are eligible for benefits. To be eligible for RECA benefits, a person must have been present onsite during an atmospheric atomic weapons test conducted by the United States in specific geographic areas. The Pacific Test Sites (Bikini Atoll, Enewetak Atoll, Johnston Island, Christmas Island), Trinity Test Site, South Atlantic Test Site, and designated locations within naval shipyards or air force bases where atomic weapons tests were conducted. Non-test affiliated ships were excluded from official zones for security and safety. Test Site for Operation Argus and the official zone around the site were designated for security and safety during atmospheric nuclear detonation testing. Decontamination of equipment used in the tests also took place at designated locations within government installations. Individuals who worked in specific occupations and activities during atomic weapons testing, including monitoring fallout, are eligible for compensation. During atmospheric atomic weapons testing at NTS, individuals in specific occupations are eligible for compensation if they were onsite during the testing period or up to six months after. These occupations include members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of various government agencies, and members of the Federal Civil. Individuals eligible for compensation if they were involved in activities around atmospheric detonations of nuclear devices, such as decontamination, cloud tracking, or serving in specific government agencies. Participants in activities around atmospheric detonations of nuclear devices, including decontamination, cloud tracking, and maintenance on Enewetak atoll or as part of a radiological safety team, may be eligible for compensation if they developed certain types of cancers. Participants involved in activities around atmospheric nuclear detonations, such as decontamination and monitoring fallout, may be eligible for compensation if they developed specific cancers. Eligibility for benefits as a downwinder is based on exposure near the Nevada Test Site for at least 24 consecutive months. To qualify for RECA benefits, a downwinder must have been physically present near the Nevada Test Site for a specific period and developed one of the listed cancers after exposure to radiation from atomic weapons tests. To qualify for RECA benefits, a uranium miner must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971, or have been exposed to 40 working-level months of radiation. A uranium miner must have worked in a uranium mine between 1942 and 1971 or been exposed to 40 working-level months of radiation in specified states. A working level month is defined as one unit of radiation exposure per work day for a month. The miner must have developed lung cancer or certain respiratory diseases due to radiation exposure. A uranium miner must have developed lung cancer or specific respiratory diseases after exposure to radiation to qualify for RECA benefits. Uranium millers and ore transporters may also be eligible if they meet certain exposure and disease criteria. Uranium millers must have worked in a uranium mill in specified states for at least one year between 1941 and 1971, while ore transporters must have transported uranium or vanadium-uranium ore. A uranium miller or ore transporter must have worked in specified states for at least one year between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure to qualify for RECA benefits. A uranium miller or ore transporter must have worked in specified states for at least one year between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure to qualify for RECA benefits. The DOJ's Civil Division administers the RECA program and makes eligibility decisions on claims, which require written documentation of illnesses for benefit claims to be submitted. The RECA program administered by the DOJ requires written documentation of illnesses for benefit claims, with specific requirements outlined in the regulations. Native American applicants have procedures that consider their laws and customs. Application decisions are made by an assistant director within the Constitutional and Specialized division. The DOJ's application and payment procedures for RECA benefits must incorporate Native American law, tradition, and custom. Decisions are made within 12 months by an assistant director in the Torts Branch. If no decision is made, the application is automatically approved. HHS is authorized to provide grants for health centers and nonprofits under the 2000 RECA amendments. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized HHS to provide grants for health centers and nonprofits to conduct cancer screenings and assist with medical documentation for RECA claims. These grants are administered by HRSA as the RESEP program, with six clinics currently operating in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. The RECA program provides grants for health centers to conduct cancer screenings and assist with medical documentation for RECA claims. There are six RESEP clinics operating in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. Applicants for RECA benefits are not required to be screened for cancer at these clinics. If denied benefits, applicants can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. Applicants denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. An appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division will rule on the appeal. If dissatisfied, applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Licensed attorneys can represent applicants in all program-related matters, and Native American claimants have additional support options. Applicants denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days and may seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Licensed attorneys and non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations can represent applicants in program-related matters. Non-attorney representatives cannot charge fees for their services. The RECA statute sets limitations on fees for licensed attorneys representing claimants. The RECA statute limits fees for licensed attorneys representing claimants, with different percentages based on the date of the contract. Attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims. The RECA program limits attorney fees for representing claimants, with different percentages based on the outcome of the claim. Attorneys can also recover costs for unsuccessful claims. Legislation has been introduced to expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers. Some Members of Congress are pushing to expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers under the RECA program, which has not seen any statutory changes since 2000. Eligibility may be extended to include uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Some Members of Congress are advocating to broaden benefits for downwinders and uranium workers under the RECA program, which has not been updated since 2000. Current eligibility requirements limit benefits to individuals present in specific counties during atmospheric testing at NTS, excluding those in closer proximity or other affected areas. New eligibility areas cannot be added through regulation or executive action. Residents outside the current downwinder eligibility area expressed concerns about health effects from atomic weapons testing fallout, seeking compensation through civil courts. Inability to win civil judgments led to the creation of the RECA program in 1990. The RECA program was created in 1990 to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. Bills introduced in 1979 aimed to make the US liable for damages caused by atomic testing to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. H.R. 4766 aimed to make the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. Eligibility for compensation under this bill included downwinders with specific types of cancer in a defined geographical area around NTS. The affected area for downwinder eligibility in H.R. 4766 was a rectangular area around NTS from 112 degrees to 117.5 degrees longitude and from 36.5 degrees to 39 degrees latitude, including parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, Mohave, and Coconino Counties. S. 1865 would have made the US liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, sheep herds, and uranium miners. The proposed bill H.R. 4766 included provisions for downwinders, onsite participants, and affected sheep herds and uranium miners. It also aimed to establish a federal advisory board to expand the list of specified cancers. The affected areas for downwinder eligibility were specified in terms of counties and geographic features in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill H.R. 4766 proposed expanding downwinder eligibility areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, giving authority to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to add more areas. The original RECA statute had a smaller coverage area for downwinders. The original RECA statute had a smaller downwinder eligibility area, which was expanded with the 2000 RECA amendments to include additional areas in Arizona and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare was given authority to add more affected areas. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, the downwinder eligibility area has expanded to include additional areas in Arizona and Utah. Members of Congress have introduced bills to further expand eligibility to include residents of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico. Members of Congress have introduced bills to expand downwinder eligibility areas, including residents of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Guam during atomic weapons testing. Legislation also aimed to include persons affected by fallout from the Trinity test in New Mexico. In 2002, Congress responded to this by mandating action in the House report accompanying the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery. In 2002, HRSA asked the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure for those living in Guam during atomic weapons testing and affected by fallout from the Trinity test in New Mexico. The NRC's final report in 2005 recommended potential expansion of the RECA downwinder area. The NRC's final report in 2005 recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA, advising against simply expanding the downwinder area based on geographic location. The NTC recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like exposure to NTS fallout and ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on factors like ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on factors like geographic, demographic, and behavioral factors. This model would estimate each applicant's absorbed dose of radionuclides to calculate the probability that their specific type of cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. Congress would then determine the threshold for awarding benefits or varying levels based on probabilities. The NRC report recommended using a probability of causation model to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on factors like absorbed dose of radionuclides and cancer type. Congress would set the threshold for benefits based on probabilities, similar to EEOICPA and VA programs. No legislation has been introduced to change RECA downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability-based. The NRC report recommended a probability of causation model for RECA benefits, but no legislation has been introduced to change downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability-based. The presumption of eligibility model used by RECA may be preferred by some advocates due to the low levels of radiation exposure from fallout. The NRC recommended a probability of causation model for RECA benefits, which may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels from fallout. The scientific evidence suggests that exposure to radiation is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer development in most cases. Scientifically based changes in eligibility criteria for compensation are expected to lead to few successful claims. The committee's conclusion, based on scientific information, is that fallout was a significant contributing factor to cancer development. Changes in eligibility criteria for compensation may result in few successful claims for RECA benefits for uranium workers exposed to radiation before 1972. The original RECA legislation set a cut-off date of December 31, 1971 for uranium worker eligibility due to the end of federal procurement of uranium for atomic weapons. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants became legal in 1964, creating a market for mined uranium post-1971. Ownership of Special Nuclear Materials Act, P.L. 88-489, legalized private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants, creating a new market for mined uranium. Legislation has been proposed to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers and research on health effects of uranium tailing piles. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to include uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations enacted since 1971, uranium workers, especially miners, remain at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. Workers, especially miners, are at a higher risk for radon-induced diseases due to elevated radiation exposure limits. The Mine Safety and Health Administration's annual limit of 4 WLM exceeds the recommended limit of 1 WLM by NIOSH. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by atomic weapons tests fallout and uranium miners exposed to high levels of radon. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by atomic weapons tests fallout and uranium miners exposed to high levels of radon. An expansion of RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would largely cover workers in the commercial uranium sector. Expanding the RECA program to include post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, potentially beyond the program's original scope. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may already be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
