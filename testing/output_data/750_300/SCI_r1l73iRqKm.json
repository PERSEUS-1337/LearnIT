    "content": "In open-domain dialogue, intelligent agents struggle to incorporate knowledge into conversations. Existing models often rely on generic responses rather than utilizing recalled knowledge as context. To address this, a new dataset grounded in knowledge from Wikipedia has been created to improve dialogue systems. A large dataset grounded in knowledge from Wikipedia has been created to improve dialogue systems. New architectures are designed to retrieve and use knowledge in conversations, leading to dialogue models capable of conducting knowledgeable discussions on open-domain topics. This benchmark allows for measuring improvements in this important research direction in AI and natural language processing. The ultimate goal of natural language research is for humans to communicate with machines. Machines need to comprehend language, retain knowledge, reason, and provide engaging responses in conversations. Current AI approaches aim to achieve this through knowledgeable discussions on various topics. Current state-of-the-art approaches in natural language processing, such as sequence to sequence models, aim to enable machines to engage in intelligent conversations by encoding input sequences, reasoning, and decoding outputs. However, these models often struggle to effectively utilize memory and knowledge in conversations. In natural language processing, sequence to sequence models aim to enable intelligent conversations by encoding input sequences, reasoning, and decoding outputs. However, more direct knowledge memory mechanisms are needed for open-domain dialogue where speakers engage in chit-chat on various topics. In open-domain dialogue, speakers engage in chit-chat on various topics, exchanging new information and personal views. Designing architectures combining Memory Network and Transformer elements is crucial for this challenging task. Designing architectures combining Memory Network and Transformer elements is crucial for open-domain dialogue, requiring specific components for knowledge retrieval and text representation. A supervised dataset of human-human conversations was created using crowd-sourced workers, with diverse discussion topics connected to Wikipedia. A supervised dataset of human-human conversations was created using crowd-sourced workers, with diverse discussion topics connected to Wikipedia. The dataset includes 201,999 utterances about 1365 topics, allowing for training and evaluating conversation models with a memory component that recalls and grounds knowledge from existing text. The conversation agent utilizes a memory component to recall and ground existing text, evaluating models' ability to use knowledge. Transformer Memory Network architectures are tested for engaging conversations with humans, outperforming baselines. A new benchmark in ParlAI aims to drive further research improvements in this area. The new benchmark in ParlAI aims to encourage and measure improvements in dialogue tasks that explicitly use knowledge, unlike existing chit-chat datasets that focus on sequence-to-sequence models without long-term knowledge recall. Our work explores unstructured knowledge from a wide range of topics, potentially covering all of Wikipedia, in contrast to goal-directed dialogue systems that rely on database access. In question answering, the focus is on providing factual answers based on questions, rather than generating responses from conversation history. Our work focuses on unstructured knowledge from various topics, including all of Wikipedia. Question answering involves providing factual answers based on questions, rather than generating responses from conversation history. Neural models have been developed to answer questions by attending to paragraphs from Wikipedia, such as in SQuAD and Open-SQuAD. The QuAC dataset explores similar themes through a sequence of questions. The QuAC dataset investigates themes through a sequence of questions and answers in dialogue form, focusing on natural human dialogues with a diverse set of utterances. This work does not address question answering but instead looks at non-goal directed dialogue incorporating knowledge. The work discussed in the curr_chunk focuses on non-goal directed dialogue incorporating knowledge, similar to previous works using Memory Networks and unstructured text for discussions on movies, news articles, and local businesses. The curr_chunk discusses BID8 using an extended Encoder-Decoder for dialogues with external knowledge encoding. The comparison is made with Memory Networks BID19 and Transformers for dialogue tasks. The curr_chunk introduces a comparison between Memory Networks BID19 and Transformers for dialogue tasks in an open-domain setting. It also mentions the development of an architecture that combines these approaches and highlights the novelty of working on full multi-turn dialogue in this context. Our paper presents models for full multi-turn dialogue in an open-domain setting, where two participants engage in chitchat with one being a knowledgeable expert (wizard) and the other a curious learner (apprentice). The apprentice's goal is to delve deep into the conversation with the wizard. The conversation involves a knowledgeable expert (wizard) and a curious learner (apprentice). The apprentice engages in deep discussions with the wizard, focusing on a chosen topic of interest to make the conversation engaging and fun. The wizard is instructed to discuss a topic with the curious apprentice. The task involves a knowledgeable expert (wizard) engaging in deep discussions with a curious learner (apprentice) about a chosen topic. The wizard's goal is to inform their conversation partner about a topic chosen by one of them, using an information retrieval system to access relevant Wikipedia paragraphs. The task involves a knowledgeable expert (wizard) engaging in deep discussions with a curious learner (apprentice) about a chosen topic. The wizard uses a system to show relevant Wikipedia paragraphs to the apprentice during the conversation. The flow of the conversation involves choosing a topic, starting the conversation, and exchanging messages between the wizard and the apprentice. The conversation between the wizard and apprentice involves choosing a topic, exchanging messages, and responding based on relevant knowledge. The chat continues until one of the partners ends it, after a minimum of 4 or 5 turns each. The conversation between the wizard and apprentice involves choosing a topic, exchanging messages, and responding based on relevant knowledge. The chat continues until one of the partners ends it, after a minimum of 4 or 5 turns each. The goal is to replace the human wizard with a learned agent in conversations, using a set of diverse dialogue topics sourced from Wikipedia articles. The wizard and apprentice engage in dialogue on various topics sourced from Wikipedia articles. The wizard has access to relevant knowledge passages during the conversation. The retriever used is similar to the one in the Open-SQuAD dataset. The retriever used for presenting knowledge context to the wizard during dialogue is similar to the one in the Open-SQuAD dataset, utilizing inverted index lookup and term vector model scoring. Top articles are retrieved based on TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word and n-gram vectors, with the wizard being presented with the top 7 articles for the last two turns of dialogue and the article for the original topic. The wizard is presented with top articles for the last two turns of dialogue and the original topic. The wizard can click on article titles to expand them and select a relevant sentence for their response. The wizard can select a relevant sentence from retrieved articles in the dialogue UI to respond to the apprentice. The dialogue model aims to replace the wizard by learning from a knowledge source like Wikipedia. In this work, dialogue models are developed to replace the wizard in learning tasks. These models have access to a knowledge source, such as Wikipedia, to ground conversations. Extensions of Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 models are created to retrieve relevant information from a large memory, read and attend to the knowledge, and generate dialogue utterances. The models are used consecutively in each turn to form dialogues with users. The dialogue models developed in this work have access to a knowledge source, such as Wikipedia, to ground conversations. Two classes of models are created: retrieval models that select from a set of candidate responses, and generative models that produce responses word-by-word. The input to both models is the current dialogue context at each turn. The dialogue models have access to a knowledge base organized into documents and sentences. They use information retrieval techniques due to the scale of the knowledge base. The dialogue models utilize standard information retrieval techniques to access a large hierarchical knowledge base, returning a smaller set of candidates for fine-grained selection. The IR system operates on the topic and the last two turns, effectively making three different queries. The IR system provided to human annotators during dataset creation operates on the topic and the last two turns, calling the IR system three times with different queries. The top 7 articles are retrieved for each lookup, and the results are flattened into separate sentences with article titles prepended. These sentences are then given to the neural model as candidates for the next stage. The IR system retrieves top 7 articles for each lookup, flattens results into sentences with article titles, and provides them as candidates for the neural model. An attention mechanism selects knowledge sentences for the next dialogue turn independently encoded with a Transformer encoder. The neural model uses an attention mechanism to select knowledge sentences for the next dialogue turn, encoded with a Transformer encoder. The final stage involves predicting the output utterance for the next dialogue turn. Different variants of knowledge attention and utterance prediction are considered for retrieval and generative models. The final stage involves predicting the output utterance for the next dialogue turn by encoding knowledge sentences and dialogue context with a Transformer. Different variants of knowledge attention and utterance prediction are considered for retrieval and generative models. The model predicts the output utterance by encoding knowledge sentences and dialogue context with a Transformer, using dot-product attention and cross-entropy loss for training. Two versions, Two-stage and End-to-end, are considered for finding relevant knowledge and generating responses. In the Two-stage and End-to-end versions, models select the most relevant knowledge and encode it with the dialogue context to formulate responses. Beam search with BPE encoding is used to generate the best response. The End-to-end version employs a shared Transformer encoder for all candidates and dialogue history. The End-to-end version of generative models uses BPE encoding BID16 to enable copying rare words from Wikipedia sentences. It employs a shared Transformer encoder to encode all candidates and dialogue history, producing an attention prediction over the memory. The selected knowledge is concatenated with the dialogue encoding and passed into a Transformer decoder. The End-to-end model uses BPE encoding to copy rare words from Wikipedia sentences. It employs a shared Transformer encoder for encoding candidates and dialogue, producing attention prediction over memory. The selected knowledge is concatenated with dialogue encoding and passed to a Transformer decoder. Training minimizes negative log-likelihood of response utterance. Additional supervision can be added by forcing correct knowledge selection as human wizard. In Two-stage version, two separately trained models are used for each task. In the Two-stage version, two separately trained models are used for knowledge selection and utterance prediction. Knowledge dropout is employed to improve decoder performance by preventing the model from attending to knowledge during training. In the Two-stage version, two separately trained models are used for knowledge selection and utterance prediction. Knowledge dropout is employed to improve decoder performance by preventing the model from attending to knowledge during training. This technique helps the generator be more resilient to errors and speeds up training. The experimental setups and results are described, focusing on the ability of models to select knowledge appropriately and perform dialogue tasks with knowledge. The study compares Transformers with baselines like random, Information Retrieval, and Bag-of-Words Memory Network BID19 in selecting knowledge for dialogue tasks. The feasibility of predicting human-selected knowledge in a two-stage architecture is assessed before examining the full Wizard dialogue task. The study compares Transformers with baselines like random, Information Retrieval, and Bag-of-Words Memory Network BID19 in selecting knowledge for dialogue tasks. Transformers work best when pretrained on a large dataset like Reddit, while multi-tasking on SQuAD has minimal impact. Further analysis using other models is provided in Appendix B.1. The study evaluates Transformer models pretrained on Reddit for dialogue generation tasks, with minimal impact from multi-tasking on SQuAD. The best performing Transformer model is used for a two-stage generative Memory Network. Experiments are conducted on dialogue generation with knowledge, either given by a human or predicted by the model. Transformer Memory Networks are applied, attending over knowledge in the experiments.

Transformer Memory Networks are applied, attending over knowledge in the experiments. The addition of knowledge improves all models, with significant performance improvements when models are provided gold knowledge. The addition of knowledge significantly improves Transformer models for dialogue generation tasks. Performance enhancements are observed when models are provided with gold knowledge. Generative experiments comparing different models show improvements in perplexity and unigram F1 scores. The End-to-end and Two-stage models utilize knowledge in response predictions, outperforming the Transformer model without knowledge. The Two-stage model performs better with predicted knowledge, while the End-to-end model excels with gold knowledge. The Two-stage model shows improvements with predicted knowledge, while the End-to-end model performs better with gold knowledge. The End-to-end model benefits from additional knowledge selection supervision, leading to improvements in all metrics. Knowledge dropout also proves to be beneficial.

In a conversation about E-books, individuals express a preference for physical books over E-books due to the tactile experience and smell of real books. In a conversation about E-books, individuals express a preference for physical books over E-books due to the tactile experience and smell of real books. They discuss the disorientation of reading on a screen and the satisfaction of owning a physical copy. Model preferences for print and newsreels are also mentioned. The Two-stage models outperform retrieval models in F1 scores. Human evaluation involves pairing humans with models for conversation and rating the engagingness. Wiki F1 score is calculated based on F1 overlap in collected conversations. The engagingness rating is based on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the best. The Wiki F1 score measures the model's knowledge by comparing its utterances with the first 10 sentences of a Wikipedia page. A total of 546 conversations were collected for evaluation, including 100 human-human conversations for comparison. The study collected 546 conversations for evaluation, including 100 human-human conversations. Retrieval models outperformed generative models in human engagingness evaluation. The study compared retriever and generative models in human engagingness evaluation. Retrieval models did not show significant differences with or without knowledge, but trended towards using knowledge. Generative models significantly improved human engagingness ratings with the use of knowledge, achieving higher Wiki F1 scores in both seen and unseen test sets. The study found that generative models significantly improved human engagingness ratings by using knowledge, as indicated by higher Wiki F1 scores on both seen and unseen test sets. The gap between retrieval and generative models was larger on unseen data, where retrieval models are limited by the training set. There is still a considerable gap to human ratings compared to all models. In this work, dialogue agents are developed with large memory systems containing encyclopedic knowledge to engage in open-domain conversations. Transformer Memory Network models are used to retrieve and generate responses. Additional analysis and examples can be found in the appendices. Our study introduces Transformer Memory Network models for engaging open-domain conversations by retrieving and generating responses using encyclopedic knowledge. We utilize the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset to train and evaluate these models, demonstrating their effectiveness through automatic and human experiments. This benchmark dataset aims to inspire further research in this area, leading to significant advancements in dialogue agent development. Our new benchmark dataset encourages model exploration for engaging open-domain conversations by retrieving and generating responses using encyclopedic knowledge. Future work includes bridging the gap between retrieval and generative models, learning to retrieve and reason simultaneously, and investigating the relationship between knowledge-grounded dialogue and existing QA tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the aim of combining knowledge retrieval and reasoning in dialogue systems to create an engaging conversational agent. It includes examples of conversations from a dataset where a wizard with access to an information retrieval system interacts with an apprentice. Knowledge retrieval is based on dialogue history, providing multiple knowledge candidates per turn. The wizard in the conversation has access to an information retrieval system over Wikipedia, allowing them to ask and answer questions relevant to the discussion. Knowledge retrieval is based on dialogue history, providing multiple knowledge candidates per turn. The dataset shows that apprentices ask questions in 13.9% of training set utterances, answer questions 39.5% of the time, and make new or follow-on statements 49.3% of the time. The dataset shows that apprentices ask questions in 13.9% of training set utterances, answer questions 39.5% of the time, and make new or follow-on statements 49.3% of the time. To select natural topics, the Persona-Chat dataset BID26 was used, consisting of \u223c1000 personas with 4-5 sentences describing their interests. The Persona-Chat dataset BID26 contains \u223c1000 personas with 4-5 sentences describing interests, which were mapped to relevant Wikipedia pages. This resulted in 1,431 topics for the task. The Persona-Chat dataset contains \u223c1000 personas with interests mapped to Wikipedia pages, resulting in 1,431 topics. During data collection, 2-3 related topic choices are presented as conversation starters per dialogue. Additional experiments were conducted on knowledge selection tasks, showing the performance of retrieval systems. The performance of the retrieval system for knowledge selection tasks was tested, with results indicating room for improvement. An analysis of dialogues from human evaluation experiments was conducted, with conversations re-tokenized and analyzed in a single-blind setup. In evaluation experiments, 20 conversations were sampled from each setting, seen and unseen, and analyzed for common errors and behaviors. Human-human conversations differed significantly from bot conversations, with humans engaging in more small talk and using the topic as an icebreaker. In contrast to human-human conversations, where one human has access to Wikipedia, conversations with bots tend to be more factual and less focused on small talk. Models could benefit from additional training data like SQuAD to improve their performance, especially the retriever model which is prone to changing the subject rapidly. The retriever model, when lacking knowledge, tends to go off-topic during conversations. On the other hand, when equipped with knowledge, it sticks to the chosen topic but struggles if the subject changes. Additionally, a two-stage retrieval system was tested on the full Wizard task. The two-stage retrieval system tested on the full Wizard task outperformed the best retrieval method in terms of F1 but not in terms of Recall@1. The system's performance on the gold knowledge task suggests potential for improvement. The two-stage retrieval system outperformed the best method in terms of F1 but not Recall@1. Results suggest potential for improvement in the retrieval system by enhancing performance on knowledge selection. Human experiments were conducted to compare Wiki F1 scores between wizard and apprentice. The wizard and apprentice in the dataset were evaluated for comparison with human evaluations. The wizard had direct access to Wikipedia passages, leading to higher Wiki F1 values. The apprentice often provided factually inaccurate answers but had inviting responses for a natural conversational flow. The model often provides inaccurate answers to user queries, such as listing locations in Greece when asked about parts of Ireland to visit. Despite this, it can have inviting responses for a more natural conversational flow. The generator without knowledge exhibits typical behaviors of seq2seq systems, including repetition and inconsistencies in its personality. The generator with knowledge has fewer issues with repetition and can act as a selfish conversationalist. It sometimes produces inaccurate statements but generally provides accurate information. The generator with knowledge can act as a conversationalist, providing accurate information from Wikipedia. It may occasionally give incorrect details but can generalize to new topics successfully."
