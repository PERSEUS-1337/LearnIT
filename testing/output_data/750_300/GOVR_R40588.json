The World Health Organization (WHO) later explained that pigs can be infected by various flu viruses from birds, humans, and pigs, leading to gene reassortment and the emergence of new virus strains. The emergence of a novel influenza virus in 2009, initially called \"swine flu,\" was a result of gene reassortment in pigs infected with flu viruses from birds, humans, and pigs. This reassortment led to the creation of a new virus strain with genes of swine, avian, and human origin, which had not been seen before in humans or swine. The virus is now being transmitted from human to human in a sustained manner. The exact origin and timing of this reassortment are unknown. The novel influenza virus in 2009, known as H1N1, emerged from gene reassortment in pigs infected with flu viruses from birds, humans, and pigs. This new virus strain contains genes of swine, avian, and human origin, not previously seen in humans or swine. It is now transmitted from human to human and is referred to as Influenza A(H1N1) by WHO and 2009 H1N1 flu by CDC. H1N1 is less lethal than H5N1 avian influenza but slightly more lethal than seasonal flu. The 2009 H1N1 flu virus, also known as H1N1, is not as lethal as H5N1 avian influenza but slightly more lethal than seasonal flu. It has spread enough to be considered a pandemic, with researchers uncertain about its full virulence. In April 2009, CDC reported cases of H1N1 in California and Texas, with gene segments from swine flu viruses found in infected individuals who had no contact with pigs. On April 24, 2009, Mexico announced a new strain of influenza affecting the country with over 1,000 suspected cases. Schools and public gatherings were closed in Mexico City and surrounding states until May 6, 2009. WHO reported cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths by April 27, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Mexico announced a new strain of influenza, leading to closures of schools and public gatherings in Mexico City and surrounding states until May 6, 2009. By April 27, 2009, cases were reported in Canada and Spain with no deaths. WHO raised the influenza pandemic alert level to Phase 5 two days later. Phase 4 involves human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus causing 'community-level outbreaks.' Phase 5 is marked by spread to at least two countries in one WHO region, signaling an imminent pandemic. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, as the virus was deemed \"moderately severe\" by Director-General Margaret Chan. On June 11, 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the moderately severe H1N1 virus. By June 22, 2009, over 50,000 human cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in more than 80 countries, with 231 deaths reported. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 human cases of H1N1 in 80+ countries with 231 deaths. The number of cases may be higher as only confirmed cases are reported. WHO states no risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked pork. Limiting travel has little effect on the spread of the virus. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and WHO confirm no risk of contracting H1N1 from well-cooked pork. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they have little impact on virus spread but may disrupt the global community. Ill individuals should postpone international travel. Most H1N1 patients experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. According to WHO, most people with H1N1 experience influenza-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness and death. The current strain of H1N1 is a new virus, and older antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness against it. The WHO has found that older antiviral drugs are not very effective against the new H1N1 virus, but oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are. They have a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries, distributing 3 million courses from the stockpile. The WHO has a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries. They are distributing 3 million courses to developing countries in need. There is no available vaccine against the current strain of H1N1, and currently available seasonal influenza vaccines will offer no protection. WHO and CDC are preparing vaccine candidate viruses, estimating it could take five to six months for the strain to be modified. Currently available seasonal influenza vaccines will not protect against H1N1. WHO and CDC are working on developing a vaccine, which could take five to six months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Most countries, except China, are following WHO recommendations. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline pledge to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. China quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to Mexico barring flights to China. No other country has taken similar actions. Mexico responded by barring all flights to China until \"concerns about discrimination were addressed.\" Some countries have warned against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico, with the European Union Health Commissioner urging Europeans to postpone travel to these countries. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico but later downgraded the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" Vassiliou urged Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC also recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico but later downgraded the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, citing marginal benefits and high costs. The strain of the virus detected in Mexico is already present throughout the United States. Closing the U.S. border to Mexico would have minimal benefits with high costs, as the virus strain from Mexico is already widespread in the United States. Focus should be on mitigating the virus rather than containment through border closures. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Several countries have implemented thermal scanners in airports to detect high body temperatures in travelers. Some countries have taken actions to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, such as ordering the slaughter of pigs and banning pork imports from certain countries. USAID established the Pandemic. The United States has provided over $16 million in aid to assist Latin American and Caribbean countries in responding to H1N1 outbreaks. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian efforts. Several countries have banned pork imports and ordered the slaughter of pigs as a precaution. The United States has provided $16 million in aid to assist Latin American and Caribbean countries in responding to H1N1 outbreaks. U.S. aid focuses on H1N1 specifically and builds on pandemic preparedness efforts since the 2003 SARS outbreak. Responses are mainly conducted by CDC and USAID, with support from the Department of Defense. Assistance efforts focus on commodity delivery and disease detection. The U.S. has provided aid to Latin American and Caribbean countries for H1N1 outbreaks, with support from CDC, USAID, and the Department of Defense. USAID donated PPE kits and disinfectant powder to Vietnam for responding to avian or H1N1 influenza outbreaks. The CDC has provided over $57,000 worth of disinfectant kits to help animal health workers respond quickly to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. CDC's influenza laboratory in Atlanta collaborates with WHO and creates testing kits for detecting influenza subtypes worldwide. CDC collaborates with WHO to create testing kits for detecting influenza subtypes worldwide. CDC also sends experts to help strengthen laboratory capacity and train health experts in controlling virus spread. HHS Secretary announced moving 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, representing less than 1% of the total American stockpile. Administration aims to distribute 2. HHS Secretary announced moving 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, representing less than 1% of the total American stockpile. Administration aims to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. The CDC deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala to work on influenza epidemiology, laboratory capacity, health communications, and emergency operations. They collaborate with various global organizations to better understand H1N1 transmission patterns and improve clinical illness severity assessment. The CDC collaborates with global organizations to understand H1N1 transmission patterns and improve laboratory capacity in Mexico. They support pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries by sending experts or providing funding. USAID announced additional funding to WHO and PAHO for pandemic response efforts. USAID announced on April 28, 2009, an additional $5 million funding to WHO and PAHO for H1N1 response in Latin America and the Caribbean. As of May 18, 2009, USAID has provided a total of $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with $0.9 million directed at Mexico, $0.2 million in Panama, and $5 million to the region. The assistance includes support to FAO for animal surveillance. USAID provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance as of May 18, 2009.

In Ethiopia, USAID held a three-day pandemic preparedness exercise with stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. In April 2009, USAID provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, including a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia with stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. Participants identified roles, established coordination principles, developed a pandemic response action plan, and tested existing plans through a simulation exercise to improve preparedness for potential influenza pandemics. USAID conducted a simulation exercise to test and improve pandemic preparedness plans, focusing on influenza viruses from various sources. The exercises also addressed cross-border population movement issues. Similar exercises were planned for South Africa and Asia in 2009. USAID conducted pandemic preparedness exercises focusing on influenza outbreaks and cross-border population movement issues. They plan to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. Additionally, USAID is collaborating with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness during a pandemic. In 2009, USAID conducted joint pandemic preparedness exercises with PACOM, AFRICOM, and the World Food Program involving 27 African and Asian countries. Congress provided emergency funds for global pandemic influenza preparedness efforts since FY2005. The United States has provided significant funding for global pandemic influenza preparedness efforts since FY2005, totaling $949 million. This accounts for 30.9% of overall international donor pledges of $3.07 billion, making the U.S. the largest single donor in this area. The United States has contributed $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making up 30.9% of international donor pledges. The funds have supported preparedness, surveillance, and response efforts in over 100 nations and jurisdictions. The $949 million provided by the United States for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts includes funding for bilateral activities, support to international organizations like WHO and UNICEF, regional programs, a global contingency fund, and international technical and humanitarian assistance. The United States allocated $123 million for regional disease detection sites, $83 million for a global contingency fund, $77 million for international assistance and coordination, $71 million for influenza research and wild bird surveillance, and $67 million for stockpiles of non-pharmaceutical supplies. The U.S. allocated $949 million for various initiatives, including the Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance (GAINS), stockpiles of non-pharmaceutical supplies, and global communications and outreach. USAID contributed $542 million, while HHS, including CDC, NIH, and FDA, contributed $353 million. The U.S. allocated $949 million for global initiatives, with contributions from USAID, HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS. President Obama requested an additional $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness. President Barack Obama requested $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for pandemic preparedness. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID and $200 million for CDC for H1N1 activities, with no specified amount for international efforts. Infectious diseases account for over 25% of global deaths. In 2009, President Obama requested $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million to USAID and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities, without specifying the amount for international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with concerns rising due to outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. The emergence of H1N1 influenza highlights the threat of infectious diseases, with 75% of recent diseases originating from animals. Infectious diseases, like influenza A H1N1, pose a global security threat with 75% of recent diseases originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other international players have been crucial in preparing for pandemics and monitoring infectious disease spread. Investments by the United States and other international players have helped prepare for pandemics like H1N1. Health experts have made progress in developing tests and treatments for the disease, but concerns remain about poorer countries' capacity to monitor and respond effectively. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries' ability to monitor and respond to H1N1, especially as winter approaches and transmission rates may increase. Questions also remain about the potential for the virus to change or reassort its genes, particularly in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Some health experts are concerned about the global spread of H1N1 as countries enter winter and report cases. Questions arise about the virus potentially changing or reassorting its genes, especially in countries with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Debate in May 2009 focused on whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system or develop an alert system based on severity. The debate over WHO's pandemic influenza phase system continues, with some advocating for an alert system based on severity. Concerns include public understanding of the severity levels and potential panic if the threat level is raised to Phase 6. Recent cases of human-to-human transmission in Japan are cited as justification for raising the pandemic threat level. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, citing recent cases of sustained human-to-human transmission of H1N1 in Japan. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the shift did not indicate a change in severity. WHO also updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, retaining the six-phase structure but redefining the phases for accuracy. WHO updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, retaining the six-phase structure but redefining the phases for accuracy. The update outlines steps governments should take in planning and preparing for an epidemic. USAID announced a new five-year emerging pandemic threats program in April 2009. USAID announced a new five-year emerging pandemic threats program in April 2009 to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans, like SARS and H5N1. The program will collaborate with CDC and USDA, focusing on establishing a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis in both animal and human populations. USAID plans to invest in establishing a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis of new emergent pathogens in both animal and human populations. Concerns have been raised about the poor condition of laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa, with only South Africa and Botswana confirming cases of H1N1. South Africa is the only sub-Saharan country with confirmed cases of H1N1. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are generally poor, leading to limited public health and surveillance capacity. Efforts are being made by CDC, USAID, and other international health experts to improve these systems, including sending H1N1 testing kits to laboratories in Africa. Despite weak laboratory and disease surveillance capacity in most African countries, efforts by CDC, USAID, and other international health experts have been made to improve systems. CDC has distributed H1N1 testing kits to 237 laboratories in 107 countries, including 18 in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a contentious issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission and global H5N1 outbreaks. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a contentious issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission and global H5N1 outbreaks. Concerns about access resurfaced during the recent H1N1 outbreaks, with worries that poorer countries would be unable to afford vaccines. The link between access, poverty, and health has been well-documented, with USAID estimating that about 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to healthcare. Some concerns have been raised about poorer countries lacking access to vaccines, with most of the global capacity located in Europe and North America. Richer countries may hoard vaccines during a pandemic, leaving poorer countries reliant on donor generosity. Some concerns have been raised about poorer countries lacking access to vaccines, with most of the global capacity located in Europe and North America. Richer countries may hoard vaccines during a pandemic, leaving poorer countries reliant on donor generosity. WHO reported that national authorities, not the organization, would conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns if a vaccine is developed. The WHO expects national authorities to conduct mass vaccination campaigns, as poorer countries may struggle with routine vaccines. 1.4 million deaths in children under five could have been prevented with routine vaccination. In 2002, 1.4 million deaths in children under five could have been prevented by routine vaccination, representing 14% of global mortality in this age group. Health experts are concerned about the potential reassortment of H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 strains, which could create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Health experts were concerned about the potential reassortment of H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 strains in the same area, which could lead to the creation of a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. The first human cases of avian influenza were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam in January 2004, linked to highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks in poultry that began in 2003. All prerequisites for a pandemic were met except efficient human-to-human transmission. Efficient human-to-human transmission was the only missing factor for a pandemic to start. Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in poultry affected eight Asian nations since 2003. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide confirmed H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with the disease becoming endemic in Asia. Indonesia and Cambodia were the only countries not reporting human H5N1 cases in 2008 and 2009. H5N1 bird flu has become endemic in Asia, with health experts monitoring if countries with ongoing cases will also see H1N1 cases. Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases. H5N1 is more deadly but less easily transmissible than H1N1. Most H5N1 deaths result from direct contact with sick birds, while the source of H1N1 transmission is unknown."
