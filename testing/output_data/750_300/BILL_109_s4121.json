If the election is made, liability is determined under subsection (b) within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The applicable pension plan's liability is determined under subsection (c). If an eligible employer elects within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the plan's assets and liabilities are spun off to an eligible spunoff plan, and the employer's liability is determined by reference to the spunoff plan. The employer's liability for the applicable pension plan is determined by reference to the eligible spunoff plan. This liability is in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. Liability of employers electing spinoff: The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments do not apply to eligible spunoff plans until they cease to be eligible or January 1, 2017. The employer is responsible for ongoing funding liability until then.

If an eligible employer does not elect spinoff, they are liable for the terminated plan under ERISA. If an eligible employer does not elect spinoff, they are liable for the terminated pension plan under ERISA, in an amount equal to the fractional portion of the adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities of the plan. The employer is liable for the pension plan's unfunded benefit liabilities if they do not elect spinoff. Adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities are determined as of December 31, 2005. Adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities are the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities with a specific interest assumption. The term \"fractional portion\" refers to a fraction representing the amount required to be contributed to the pension plan for the 5 plan years before. The term \"fractional portion\" is defined as a fraction where the numerator is the amount required to be contributed to the pension plan by the employer for the 5 plan years before December 31, 2005, and the denominator is the total amount required to be contributed by all employers who do not make a specific election. The term \"applicable pension plan\" refers to a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967, with 2 or more contributing sponsors, at least 2 of which are not under common control. The term \"allocable portion\" is defined as the portion eligible employers contribute when making an election. The term \"allocable portion\" refers to the portion of an applicable pension plan's liabilities and assets that eligible employers contribute when making an election. The excess of plan liabilities over plan assets, determined for eligible employers in an eligible multiple employer plan, is divided by the total excess amount to calculate the allocable portion. An eligible employer is defined as one participating in the plan after January 1, 2000."
