    "content": "The \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use and public facility planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. Despite land use planning falling under State and local jurisdiction, there is a need for better coordination and preparedness. The Federal Government and State governments should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into land use planning to enhance community safety and reduce post-disaster recovery costs for United States taxpayers. Disaster response and relief efforts incur significant costs for US taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should prioritize prevention of property damage and human casualties by integrating mitigation strategies from various professional fields. Disaster planning should prioritize prevention of property damage and human casualties by integrating mitigation strategies from various professional fields, including urban, community, and regional planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and urban design. The Federal Government and States should support comprehensive planning to reduce risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. Many States have land use statutes that do not align with comprehensive planning goals. Efforts are being made to update state land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, including long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. Coordination between state and local plans for at-risk public infrastructure requires additional state-level planning. Efforts are being made to update state land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, including long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. Coordination between state and local plans for at-risk public infrastructure requires additional state-level planning. Comprehensive urban planning integrates land use, transportation systems, water and wastewater facilities, open space, and critical infrastructure to promote safe and economically viable communities. Local governments should incorporate safety considerations into their planning efforts, including safe housing. Local governments should integrate safety considerations into comprehensive planning efforts to ensure safe housing options are available for all community members. Prevailing land use patterns can put people, structures, and environmental systems at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to address growth pressures and haphazard development patterns in rural communities and small towns on the metropolitan fringe. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to address natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in incorporating risk-reduction and hazard mitigation strategies into land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in incorporating risk-reduction and hazard mitigation strategies into land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local planning director must submit an application demonstrating that their land use planning goals align with specific guidelines. The Secretary requires an application demonstrating that State or local government land use planning goals align with guidelines on citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation. The legislation emphasizes the importance of multi-jurisdictional cooperation and multi-agency coordination in developing land use plans to assess risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts. Implementation elements in land use plans include a timetable for action, defining roles and responsibilities of agencies, local governments, and citizens, and aligning with State and local capital budget objectives. The comprehensive planning process includes defining roles and responsibilities of agencies, local governments, and citizens, aligning with capital budget objectives, and guiding decisions on future infrastructure development. Comprehensive planning includes incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into state or locally adopted land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. The government also addresses how these plans will be updated over time. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing a comprehensive land use plan integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) can be used for developing a comprehensive land use plan, assessing critical public infrastructure, and developing geographical information systems. The grant funds can be used for developing land use policies, geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, and assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use. Implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability in land use, incorporating mitigation and security in transportation plans, and encouraging interagency cooperation between first-responders and planning agencies. The grant program aims to enhance cooperation between first-responders and planning agencies, integrate natural hazard areas into comprehensive plans, and limit the grant amount to $1,125,000 with a maximum federal share of 90% for project funding. The Federal share of a project funded with a grant under subsection (a) shall not exceed 90%, but the Secretary may increase the Federal share for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations if they lack sufficient funds. The Secretary will encourage coordination of land use planning for Federal land among Federal land management agencies. The Tribal government or Native Hawaiian organization lacks funds to contribute to the project. The Secretary will encourage coordination of land use planning for Federal land with State or local planning directors. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security will conduct audits on grants provided under this section.
