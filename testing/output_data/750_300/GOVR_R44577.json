A conference committee was convened to reconcile differences between the two versions. The House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee was convened to resolve differences between the versions, leading to the final bill being signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of congressional and constituent interest. Related CRS products are referenced for more detailed information and analysis. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of congressional and constituent interest, with references to related CRS products for more detailed information and analysis. Contact information for a CRS analyst is provided for each issue discussed. Some issues were previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and in other reports. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, recent years saw decreases in end-strengths for Air Force and Navy due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. FY2016 and FY2017 authorized end-strengths are shown in Figure 1. In FY2017, the Administration proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the Senate approving the same and the House approving higher end-strengths, particularly for the Army. The Navy's end-strength was reduced in the House bill. The House proposed higher end-strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to the Administration's request. The Navy's end-strength was reduced in the House bill but still higher than the Administration's request. Section 402 of the House bill adjusted minimum end-strengths to match authorized levels for FY2017. The final bill sets the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two. The Senate bill proposed identical end-strengths as the Administration request. The Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two in FY2017. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. Congressional interest in military personnel costs and quality remains focused on the annual military pay raise. The military pay raise is of long-standing congressional interest to recruit and retain high-quality personnel in the all-volunteer military. Section 1009 of Title 37 US Code provides for an annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The increase for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Pay raises typically take effect at the start of the calendar year. The military pay raise for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. In the past three years, the President used alternative pay adjustment authority to set the raise below the ECI. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% raise, lower than the statutory formula. The House bill aimed to require the statutory raise. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed to require the statutory raise of 2.1%, while the Senate bill proposed a 1.6% increase. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers effective January 1, 2017. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% increase in basic pay for military personnel, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment of 1.6%. Reference(s): CRS In Focus IF10260, Defense Primer: Military Pay Raise. Under current law, all servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to provide servicemembers with appropriate housing options. BAH rates vary by location but ensure comparable housing for servicemembers of similar rank and dependent status. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependents. It would base BAH on actual housing expenses up to a maximum amount for a specific location/paygrade, instead of a set rate. The Senate bill proposed changes to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), focusing on location and paygrade instead of dependents. It would calculate BAH based on actual housing expenses up to a maximum amount for a specific location/paygrade, and adjust the allowance for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new formula for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018. It would limit the allowance for members sharing housing based on the total number of occupants. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2017 on transitioning certain reserve and retired personnel ordered to active duty, and servicemembers entitled to BAH on December 31, 2017, who lose eligibility for housing allowance. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2017 on transitioning reserve and retired personnel to active duty, and servicemembers entitled to BAH who lose eligibility for housing allowance. The proposed regulations for a new pay structure must be submitted to the congressional defense committees by March 31, 2017, aiming to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The conference report discusses the evolution of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas, recognizing the transient nature of military service and its impact on families. The conference report highlights the purpose of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas, emphasizing its tax-free nature and eligibility criteria based on dependency status. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning with the Department's use of the allowance. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the payment of the housing allowance with the Department's use of the allowance as compensation rather than its intended purpose. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce retired pay benefits, including a reduced pay multiplier, a 401k-type defined contribution element, partial lump-sum payment option, and continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018. The military retirement system will undergo changes on January 1, 2018, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will apply to servicemembers entering on or after that date and those with 12 years or less of service who choose to enroll in the new system. Military and veterans' groups closely monitor any alterations to the retirement system, which has historically been a key factor in retaining a career military force. The military retirement system changes effective January 1, 2018, include reducing the retired pay multiplier and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive for servicemembers with 12 years of service. This has raised concerns about retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay at any point between 8 to 12 years of service in return for a 3-year commitment to address retention concerns for specific military specialties. The provision in the enacted bill allows DOD to offer targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties, with a minimum pay amendment for reserve component members on active duty. The Senate bill would express the sense of Congress that default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan, which is a better savings vehicle for young, low-income individuals in the military. The Senate bill suggests default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan, which is beneficial for young, low-income individuals in the military. Section 631 allows cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. Military servicemembers who are in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, have a 30-day election period for the new retirement system after commissioning or transferring to active duty. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases and provides benefits to former spouses. The USFSPA has been amended multiple times. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases and provides benefits to former spouses. Up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay may be divisible in a divorce case. The law has been modified several times to adjust the calculation of retired pay based on pay grade and years of service at the time of retirement. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases, with up to 50% of disposable retired pay divisible. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order, with cost-of-living adjustments included in spousal payments. This change will not impact previous divorce settlements. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases based on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order, with cost-of-living adjustments included in spousal payments. This provision will not affect any divorce settlements that occurred prior to the date of enactment. A military retiree may have a portion of their monthly retired pay withheld to provide a survivor benefit to a surviving spouse or eligible recipients through the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). The survivor's payment is usually 55% of the retired basic pay. For those who died while on active duty, the base amount was calculated at 75% of their basic pay. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a survivor's payment of 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, for those who died on active duty, the base amount was 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training receive a lower SBP payment based on years of service. The FY2017 NDAA addressed this disparate treatment. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the disparate treatment of surviving spouses receiving both SBP and VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by reducing SBP payments by the amount of DIC. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was set to expire at the end of FY2017, but sections of the enacted bill extended its provisions. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the disparate treatment of surviving spouses receiving both SBP and VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by reducing SBP payments by the amount of DIC. Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill included provisions from H.R. 4909 and S. 2943. Section 642 eliminates differential treatment under the SBP for reserve and active component members who die from an injury or illness during inactive-duty training. Section 643 allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from CRSC when retired pay is insufficient. Section 643 of the FY2017 NDAA allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) when retired pay is insufficient to cover the premiums. It also extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018, with a requirement for a report on affected individuals within 90 days of enactment. CBO estimates nearly 65,000 surviving spouses would receive the SSIA in FY2018. The FY2017 NDAA allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from CRSC when retired pay is insufficient. It extends SSIA payment authority until May 31, 2018. The Defense Secretary must conduct an independent assessment of SBP and submit a report with recommendations to Congress. The Defense Secretary must conduct an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and submit a report with recommendations to Congress, including effectiveness of SBP for survivors of servicemembers, comparison of benefits with other sectors, and feasibility of alternative insurance products. The TRICARE program provides health benefits to active duty servicemembers, retirees, family members, and survivors. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to health care enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays phased in over several years. Commercially available insurance products are being considered for survivor benefits. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to the TRICARE health benefits program, including replacing current options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred options. This would involve new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and an annual catastrophic cap. Additionally, there would be annual enrollment fees for Medicare-enrolled retirees and increased costs. The proposal includes a new benefit structure with enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and an annual catastrophic cap for TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred options. It also involves annual enrollment fees for Medicare-enrolled retirees and increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. Additionally, there would be discretionary savings in the Defense Health Program appropriations account and a reduction in TRICARE for Life expenditures. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by adjusting the contribution amounts from uniformed services to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. The Congressional Budget Office estimated savings from TRICARE proposals in the President's Budget. For FY2017, the contribution to the MERHCF by each uniformed service will be $4,252 per active duty servicemember and $1,723 per reserve component member. The CBO analysis estimated savings from TRICARE proposals in the President's Budget, including pharmacy co-payment increases saving $2.8 billion, new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee saving $1.4 billion, and consolidation of TRICARE plans costing $0.2 billion. Section 701 of the enacted bill will establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option. The enacted bill includes provisions to establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option, with tables prescribing enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees. It also requires an open enrollment period and would cost DOD $0.2 billion, while increasing Medicare spending by $0.4 billion. The bill establishes TRICARE Select with enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees. It requires an open enrollment period and limits pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime. The bill establishes TRICARE Select with enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees. It limits pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime to specific inpatient care situations. The Secretary of Defense must submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017, to meet access criteria, with a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plans in its FY2017 budget request, including replacing current options with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and introducing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. A pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program is also planned. The TRICARE health plan options are being restructured to consolidate Prime, Standard, and Extra plans, increase pharmaceutical co-pays, and introduce a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The House and Senate bills proposed different consolidation plans, with the enacted bill specifying cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime. The enacted bill includes amendments to TRICARE health plan options, introducing new cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime. Tables specify fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases, with exceptions for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries' cost-sharing remains unchanged, and a new category for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE beneficiaries will be created. Exceptions to cost-sharing amounts will be provided to disability retirees, their dependents, and survivors. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries' cost-sharing will not change. A new \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Premiums for these programs will remain the same, but new cost-sharing provisions will apply. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will be subject to a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. The report will assess changes in health care coverage, appointment availability, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. The report will assess the availability of health care appointments, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if they obtain care without a required referral. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program that allows outpatient prescriptions to be filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill outpatient prescriptions at military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies. DOD policy favors generic medications over brand names. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies, favoring generic medications over brand names. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies, favoring generic medications over brand names. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in co-payments to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion over fiscal years 2017 to 2021. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical treatment, overriding statutory increases in pharmacy co-payments. Prior to February 1, 2016, Section 702 of FY2015 NDAA (P.L. 113-291) increased pharmacy co-payments. The Senate-passed bill aimed to allow beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing for certain groups. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to exclude drugs from coverage based on recommendations. Section 702 of FY2015 NDAA aimed to reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 by allowing the Secretary of Defense to exclude low-value drugs from coverage and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. Implementing Section 702 of the FY2015 NDAA would reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decrease health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. This would also lower accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. Implementing Section 702 of the FY2015 NDAA would reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decrease health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. This would also lower accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund by about $1.5 billion over the 2018-2021 period. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013, to support Armed Forces medical services and manage the TRICARE program. It aims to ensure a medically ready force and ready medical force for combatant commands. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is a combat support agency that manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs) to ensure a medically ready force for combatant commands. The agency acts as the market manager for the National Capital Region enhanced Multi-Service Market, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. The conference report suggests that a single agency responsible for all MTFs would best improve and sustain operational medical force. The conference report suggests that a single agency overseeing all military treatment facilities (MTFs) would improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower management costs. The current organizational structure of the military health system hinders rapid decision-making and innovation. The conference report proposes a streamlined military health system management structure to lower costs and improve care for beneficiaries by eliminating redundancy and increasing efficiency. This would lead to true reform of the military health system. The enacted bill combines provisions from the Senate and House bills to streamline military health system management, leading to cost savings and improved care for beneficiaries. The Director of the Defense Health Agency will be responsible for the administration of each MTF, including budget, IT, healthcare management, policy, military medical construction, starting October 1, 2018. The Defense Health Agency will take over the administration of each MTF, including budget, IT, healthcare management, policy, and military medical construction starting October 1, 2018. Surgeons General of each service will serve as principal advisors to the Secretary. Section 702 outlines the policy, oversight, and direction for the administration of Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). It also defines the roles and responsibilities of the Surgeons General of each service, who serve as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical matters. The Secretary is required to develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees by specified dates. Section 702 of the bill outlines the policy for Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and requires the Secretary to develop an implementation plan. It also mandates interim and final reports to be submitted to the armed services committees by specific dates. Additionally, Section 703 adds a new section to the United States Code regarding military medical treatment facilities. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to develop an implementation plan for Military Treatment Facilities by specific dates. It also adds a new section to the United States Code regarding military medical treatment facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to develop an implementation plan for Military Treatment Facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and covered beneficiaries in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to meet their needs. An exception is provided when a change in facilities or services hinders access to care through non-DOD providers. Current law sets citizenship requirements for active and reserve component enlistees, with potential waivers under certain circumstances. The Senate bill proposed amending the citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees to align with those for the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The conference bill did not include the Senate provision to amend citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave in the Armed Forces as part of the \"Force of the Future\" initiative. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for servicemembers was first authorized in 2009 and currently allows up to 10 days for a spouse giving birth and up to 21 days for adoption. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember can take leave for adoption. This leave is in addition to regular annual leave. Section 521 of the enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver, including up to 6 weeks of convalescent leave. The enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, including 6 weeks of convalescent leave. It also authorizes 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of an adoption, with secondary caregivers eligible for up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for this benefit. The bill allows up to 21 days of leave for secondary caregivers in connection with a birth or adoption. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for this benefit. Eligibility requires active duty status or active duty recall for over 12 months. The leave must be taken within a year of the event and in one increment. The bill allows up to 21 days of leave for secondary caregivers in connection with a birth or adoption, with eligibility requiring active duty status or active duty recall for over 12 months. Parental leave authorized by this provision is in addition to any other leave earned, but the Secretary of Defense may prescribe regulations requiring servicemembers to extend their service obligation or reduce existing leave when taking parental leave. Section 521 of the final bill also explicitly prohibits any additional leave for military servicemembers beyond what is authorized. The final bill allows up to 21 days of parental leave for secondary caregivers in connection with a birth or adoption, with eligibility requiring active duty status or active duty recall for over 12 months. Section 521 of the bill explicitly prohibits any additional leave for military servicemembers beyond what is authorized by statute. Approximately 60% of the active duty force has a dependent spouse and/or children, and 6.4% are in a dual-military marriage. Paid parental leave is supported for its potential to enhance workforce recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces. Supporters of paid parental leave argue that it boosts recruitment and retention in the military by making benefits more competitive. However, opponents fear it could harm readiness by causing lost duty time. Congressional authorization is required for any new leave policies. The military is concerned that lengthening maternity and parental leave could impact readiness due to lost duty time and undermanned units. Congress has authorized funding for the Defense Commissary system, with $1.4 billion in FY2016 and a proposed reduction to $1.2 billion in FY2017. Authorized patrons include active duty military members. The Defense Commissary system received $100 million more than the President's budget request of $1.2 billion for FY2017. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, Guard and Reserve component members, retired personnel and their families, 100% disabled veterans, Medal of Honor recipients, and DOD civilians stationed at U.S. installations overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required a plan for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The FY2016 NDAA required a plan for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system, with a report released by DOD on June 7, 2016. Privatization was deemed unable to replicate the benefits and savings provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. The DOD released a report on June 7, 2016, stating that privatization would not replicate the benefits and savings of DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. Critics suggest further evaluation by DOD and Congress before initiating a pilot program. The Comptroller General was directed to assess DOD's plan in Section 651, subpart (d), with the assessment published on November 9, 2016. The Comptroller General assessed DOD's June 2016 plan on achieving budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems. The assessment highlighted that DOD's report lacked a clear plan to operate without taxpayer dollars by October 2018 and did not define specific metrics for key benchmarks. The GAO found that the DOD report on achieving budget neutrality in commissaries and exchanges addressed some benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for all and only partially discussed other mandated elements. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense, which is pending. Sections 661 and 662 of the bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card. The enacted bill allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries. These reforms aim to maintain benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. The reforms at DeCA aim to ensure savings for patrons, value for taxpayers, and support for morale, welfare, and recreational activities. This includes congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. DeCA is expected to offer private label goods under a variable pricing program to recover costs. DeCA is required to set prices to cover merchandise costs and implement a variable pricing program with private label goods to offset operating costs. CBO estimates a slight decrease in direct spending over the next decade. DOD is mandated to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchange network to reduce reliance. The enacted bill requires DOD to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds. Commissaries could use flexible product pricing to maintain savings levels. DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. The Defense Department may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay from the conversion. DOD can also contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system. The Defense Department may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. This provision allows DOD to contract with commercial grocery industry experts to assist in transforming the commissary system. Section 662 authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores. The Defense Department may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. This provision allows DOD to contract with commercial grocery industry experts to assist in transforming the commissary system. Section 662 authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores.

Background: Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services. Three programs of note are the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for credentialing. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for credentialing programs to be accredited by third-party bodies, instead focusing on meeting quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 mandate DOD reports on specific transition initiatives. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for credentialing programs to be accredited by third-party bodies, focusing on quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 mandate DOD reports on specific transition initiatives, including obtaining merchant mariner licenses, assessing college credit for military skills, and evaluating the JTEST-AI program. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers. The final bill includes provisions for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, counseling on substance abuse during TAP training, and job placement services for reserve members. The final bill includes provisions for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, counseling on substance abuse during TAP training, and job placement services for reserve members. Additionally, Section 566 of the House bill, which would have authorized DOD to carry out a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members, was not adopted. The most senior officers in the military are known as general officers (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) or flag officers (Navy). These officers hold the most visible and important military positions in the DOD, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders. The most senior officers hold the rank of general or admiral (\"4-star,\" paygrade O-10). The most senior General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the military hold ranks of general or admiral (\"4-star,\" paygrade O-10), followed by lower ranks of lieutenant general, vice admiral, major general, rear admiral, and brigadier general. The total number of GFOs in each grade is limited by statute, and Congress periodically reviews and revises their number, duties, and compensation. The total number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in each grade is limited by statute, and Congress periodically reviews and revises their number, duties, and compensation.
