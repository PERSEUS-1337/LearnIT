    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge Study Act\" and includes findings. The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, northeastern bulrush, and small whorled pogonia. Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern, including the bald eagle and the Indiana bat. Cherry Valley provides habitat for at least 79 species of national or regional concern, including neotropical migratory birds, waterfowl, globally rare plants, and anadromous fish species. Cherry Valley is home to various species including neotropical migratory birds, waterfowl like the American Black Duck, globally rare plants such as the spreading globeflower, and anadromous fish species. The Cherry Valley watershed on the Kittatinny Ridge serves as an important migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States, with every migratory raptor species regularly seen during autumnal migration. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley is a significant migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States, including bald eagles, golden eagles, and broad-winged hawks. The ridge also features a segment of the Appalachian Trail and rare calcareous wetlands that have disappeared from other areas in the region. The Cherry Valley area is home to significant wildlife habitats, including rare calcareous wetlands. Ongoing studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek. Two federally-owned parcels of land, including the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a segment of the Appalachian Trail, are adjacent to the potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Public meetings over several years have shown strong local support for a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, including the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a 700-acre segment of the Appalachian Trail owned by the National Park Service. Area landowners, business leaders, and elected officials have expressed enthusiasm for the refuge. Numerous local communities, conservation entities, and State agencies are energetically conserving wildlife habitat and farmland in Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, supported by area landowners, business leaders, and elected officials. Local entities, including State land management agencies and the National Park Service, are potential strong partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in protecting Cherry Valley and conserving wildlife habitat and farmland. Many local landowners in the area have already shown support for these efforts. Several local landowners in Cherry Valley have placed their land into conservation easements or other arrangements. Funds from voter-approved open space and municipal land conservation funds in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, have supported various conservation projects in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"map\" refers to the Proposed Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge-Authorization Boundary map dated February 24, 2005. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Study Area\" includes the fish and wildlife habitat in Cherry Valley, located in northeastern Pennsylvania, as identified on the map. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and inclusion in the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders to identify eligible land and determine boundaries for potential acquisition for a national wildlife refuge in the Study Area. The Secretary will conduct a study to determine the boundaries and suitability of the Study Area for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System. This includes assessing conservation benefits for establishing a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd et seq.) requires an assessment of the conservation benefits of establishing a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, including preserving diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, protecting aquatic and wetland habitats, and aiding threatened or endangered species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 requires the establishment of Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge to preserve diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, protect aquatic and wetland habitats, aid threatened or endangered species, provide opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation, research, education, and fulfill international obligations. Public participation is also encouraged. The Secretary shall acquire up to 30,000 acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area, with a focus on public participation and consideration of local views. A report is required within one year. The Secretary will acquire a maximum of 30,000 acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area. Within one year, a report must be completed and submitted to the Senate and House committees detailing the study results. The report will include a map prioritizing land, water, and interests for acquisition by the Secretary, along with a cost estimate for acquiring them. The report will delineate an acquisition boundary for the potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, provide a cost estimate for acquiring land, water, and interests in the Study Area, and estimate funds available from non-Federal sources for acquisition and management. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The report will delineate an acquisition boundary for the potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, provide a cost estimate for acquiring land, water, and interests in the Study Area, and estimate funds available from non-Federal sources for acquisition and management. Authorization of appropriations is also included, with $200,000 authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section."
