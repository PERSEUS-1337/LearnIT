    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" connecting millions of computers worldwide through unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access to websites, with Top Level Domains indicating country codes or generic categories. Domain names were created to provide users with a simple location name, rather than using a long list of numbers. Top Level Domains (TLDs) indicate country codes or generic categories like .com or .org. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases that map address numbers to domain names, stored in root servers to ensure Internet connectivity. The Internet originated from research funding by DARPA and evolved with support from NSF and other science agencies. There are no formal authorities governing the management of the Internet and DNS, but entities like IANA played key roles. The Internet and DNS management evolved with support from DARPA, NSF, and other science agencies. IANA made technical decisions regarding root servers, country code TLDs, protocol parameters, and IP address space management. NSF managed the IP address space, delegated blocks of addresses to registries worldwide, and oversaw registration of nonmilitary domain names. In 1992, NSF solicited proposals for managing network services, leading to a five-year agreement with InterNic in 1993, making Network Solutions Inc. the sole Internet domain name registration service for .com domains. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic, making Network Solutions Inc. the sole registration service for .com, .net, and .org domains. Criticism grew over NSI's control, trademark disputes, and concerns about IANA's role lacking legal foundation for Internet stability. There was an increase in trademark disputes due to the growth of registrations in the .com domain. Concerns arose about IANA's legal foundation and the need for more permanence to ensure Internet and domain name system stability. The International Ad Hoc Committee proposed creating seven new gTLDs and selecting additional registrars to compete for registration services. The International Ad Hoc Committee proposed creating seven new gTLDs and selecting additional registrars to compete for registration services. The U.S. government created an interagency group led by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to address the domain name issue. On June 5, 1998, the Department of Commerce issued a final statement of policy on the management of Internet names and addresses. The U.S. government assigned lead responsibility to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce (DOC) to address the domain name issue. On June 5, 1998, DOC issued a final statement of policy, known as the White Paper, indicating readiness to recognize a new not-for-profit corporation formed by private sector Internet stakeholders to administer policy for the Internet name and address system. The U.S. government endorsed a new not-for-profit corporation formed by private sector Internet stakeholders to administer policy for the Internet name and address system. The White Paper emphasized the need for stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation of the Internet community. Internet constituencies worldwide discussed the structure of the New Corporation in meetings during the summer of 1998. During the summer of 1998, Internet constituencies worldwide met to discuss the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). After several iterations, ICANN's final bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. On November 25, 1998, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN. After five iterations, ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. On November 25, 1998, DOC and ICANN signed an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to extend their MOU until September 30, 2006, with transition tasks specified for ICANN to address. NTIA stated the U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing the preservation of DNS security and stability. The U.S. government aims to maintain DNS security and stability, authorizing changes to the root zone. ICANN is recognized as the technical manager of the DNS, and dialogue on Internet governance should continue. DOC extended the Joint Project Agreement with ICANN until September 30, 2009, to transition DNS management to the private sector. On September 29, 2006, DOC announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition DNS management to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, DOC and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, and security. ICANN, a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, is committed to ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, and competition in the global DNS coordination. It operates under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law and is overseen by the California attorney general. ICANN, headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, operates under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law for charitable purposes. It has tax-exempt status and is overseen by the California attorney general. ICANN's structure includes a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing Internet constituencies. ICANN operates under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law for charitable purposes and is overseen by the California attorney general. The Board of Directors is advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet constituencies and interests. The Board consists of 16 international members, including a president and members selected by different supporting organizations and committees. ICANN operates under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law and is overseen by the California attorney general. The Board of Directors consists of 16 international members, with various supporting organizations and advisory committees advising them. The organization's budget has significantly increased due to the growth of the Internet and domain name registration, with revenues reaching $159 million in 2015. The growth of the Internet and domain name registration has significantly increased ICANN's budget, reaching $159 million in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators like GoDaddy and VeriSign. Registry operators like VeriSign, Inc., Public Interest Registry, and Neustar, Inc. manage the master database of domain names in each top-level domain. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN, with other committees monitoring issues like intellectual property and privacy. The Department of Commerce oversees ICANN's activities and policies, with congressional committees monitoring issues like intellectual property and privacy. The U.S. government originally owned and operated the Internet infrastructure. The Department of Commerce (DOC) does not have authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government initially owned and operated key components of the Internet infrastructure, but a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The DOC is not involved in the internal governance or daily operations. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce started the process to transfer DNS coordination functions to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government, through the DOC, maintains a role in DNS management via contractual agreements with ICANN, including the Affirmation of Commitments and technical functions performed by IANA/ICANN. On September 30, 2009, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and ICANN signed an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize the technical coordination of the DNS globally. This agreement succeeded the Joint Project Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding between DOC and ICANN. The AoC involves various technical functions performed by IANA/ICANN and the management of the official DNS root zone file by VeriSign under a cooperative agreement with DOC. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was established to globally coordinate the DNS and is a successor to the Joint Project Agreement. It has no expiration date and would only end if one party decides to terminate it. There were disagreements among Internet stakeholders regarding the control of ICANN by the Department of Commerce after the JPA expiration in 2009. Many argued that ICANN lacked transparency and accountability. Many U.S. industry and public interest groups believed that continued U.S. government oversight of ICANN was necessary to prevent international or foreign control of the DNS, while many international entities argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization. Many U.S. industry and public interest groups believed that continued U.S. government oversight of ICANN was necessary to prevent international or foreign control of the DNS. International entities argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization. In the 110th Congress, Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564, stating that more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals directed by the JPA. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the upcoming expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the upcoming expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, highlighting the need for further progress in key areas such as long-term stability, accountability, and enhanced competition. NTIA sought public input on the transition of DNS management to the private sector, focusing on key areas like stability, accountability, and competition. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce also discussed the progress of the transition. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, with most members favoring an extension rather than replacement. On August 4, 2009, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce urged the extension of the agreement between DOC and ICANN to ensure perpetual public and global stakeholder accountability. They recommended a \"permanent instrument\" to maintain the current relationship, conduct periodic reviews of ICANN performance, and outline steps for accountability improvement. The committee letter outlines key provisions for the instrument, including ensuring the permanent continuation of the DOC-ICANN relationship, periodic reviews of ICANN performance, steps for accountability improvement, mechanism for new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, maintaining WHOIS information access, and ICANN remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. Under the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC), ICANN commits to remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices. The AoC also establishes review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) requires ICANN to establish review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. These panels will evaluate ICANN governance and assess transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to the public and global Internet community. The panel will consist of various stakeholders including the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), the Board of ICANN, the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce, representatives of relevant ICANN Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations. The panel, consisting of key stakeholders including the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), the Board of ICANN, the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce, representatives of relevant ICANN Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. The panel composition will be jointly agreed upon by the chair of the GAC and the chair of ICANN. The panel will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. It will be composed of key stakeholders including the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of relevant Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, and independent experts. The panel will periodically examine the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and consumer choice starting one year after their introduction. The panel will periodically examine the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and consumer choice. It will also review the existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. The panel will be composed of key stakeholders including the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of relevant Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, and independent experts. The panel, jointly led by the chair of the GAC and the CEO of ICANN, will review the existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. It will include key stakeholders such as representatives from Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement, and privacy experts. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released its recommendations to the Board on December 31, 2010. The panel, jointly led by the chair of the GAC and the CEO of ICANN, will review the existing WHOIS policy with key stakeholders. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. The focus now shifts to ICANN management and staff. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. The second ATRT (ATRT2) presented 12 new recommendations to ICANN in December 2013. The \"IANA functions contract\" allows ICANN to manage the technical aspects of the DNS. The ATRT2 report presented 12 new recommendations to ICANN, most of which stemmed from issues raised in the first ATRT report. The \"IANA functions contract\" authorizes ICANN to manage critical technical functions related to the DNS, such as IP address allocation and root zone file editing. Additionally, a cooperative agreement between DOC and VeriSign allows VeriSign to manage the official root zone file. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes to the DNS, such as adding new top-level domains. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file, allowing approval or denial of changes, like adding new top-level domains, to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The June 30, 2005, U.S. government principles emphasized maintaining its historic role in authorizing changes to the root zone file. The Joint Project Agreement (JPA) was separate from legal agreements with ICANN and VeriSign. The U.S. government maintains authority over the DNS root zone file to ensure security and stability. The expiration of the Joint Project Agreement (JPA) and establishment of the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) did not directly impact this authority. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015. Foreign governments have argued against U.S. exclusive control over the DNS. The U.S. government awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with provisions for extension. The contract includes a separation between policy development and implementation, a conflict of interest policy, respect for local laws, and transparency requirements. The IANA contract specifies that the contractor must be a wholly U.S. owned and operated firm or a U.S. university; operations and systems must be in the U.S.; the government can inspect facilities and processes. The U.S. government reserves the right to inspect facilities and processes for contract performance. NTIA has authority over ICANN and the domain name system, intending to transition stewardship to the global Internet community. NTIA may let its contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is looking to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet community by letting its contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is asking ICANN to work with global Internet stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition. ICANN is expected to collaborate with key stakeholders affected by the IANA contract, including IETF, IAB, ISOC, RIRs, domain name operators, Verisign, and global stakeholders. In October 2013, Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA will not accept any transition proposal that does not involve all stakeholders, including governments, on an equal footing. ICANN and IANA functions are to be globalized with all stakeholders, including governments, participating equally. NTIA requires broad community support for the transition proposal, emphasizing the multistakeholder model, Internet DNS security, global customer needs, and IANA service partners. The transition proposal for ICANN and the DNS aims to have broad community support and uphold key principles such as the multistakeholder model, Internet DNS security, global customer needs, and Internet openness. Supporters believe that transferring authority to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model and prevent intergovernmental control over the Internet. The U.S. government supports the multistakeholder model of Internet governance to prevent intergovernmental control. The transition of ICANN and DNS authority to the global community is seen as feasible due to ICANN's improved accountability and transparency. The transition of ICANN and DNS authority to the global community is now possible, as ICANN has matured and improved its accountability and transparency. Critics are concerned that without NTIA's oversight, the integrity and stability of the DNS may be compromised, especially in light of potential intergovernmental control over the Internet. Critics are concerned about the potential risks of foreign influence and intergovernmental control over the Internet and the DNS if NTIA's authority over ICANN and the DNS were to no longer exist. They also worry about the development of a new international multistakeholder entity to oversee the domain name system. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer has U.S. government oversight. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, would prevent NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up oversight of the Internet domain name system until a report on the implications is submitted to Congress by the GAO. The report will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the change, address national security concerns, and define the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking and governance. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, requires a GAO report on the implications of relinquishing NTIA's oversight of the Internet domain name system. The report will analyze advantages, disadvantages, and address national security concerns. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved H.R. 4342 on May 8, 2014, and requested the GAO to examine the Administration's proposal for the transition of NTIA's authority over IANA to a multistakeholder model. The DOTCOM Act, H.R. 4342, was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. The GAO was requested to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. Representative Shimkus offered the text of the DOTCOM Act as an amendment to H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, which was passed by the House on the same day. The House passed H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, with an amendment to include protections for the .mil domain and maintain separation in Internet governance. The Senate reported S. 2410 for the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act on June 2, 2014. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported maintaining separation between policymaking and technical operation of root-zone management functions. S. 2410, the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, recommended transferring the remaining role of the US Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with conditions related to the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended transferring the US Government's role in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with conditions related to the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol. The Department of Defense was directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended transferring the US Government's role in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with conditions related to the '.MIL' top-level domain. DOD was directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek an agreement for the .mil domain status post-transition. The .mil domain will maintain its generic top-level domain status after the transition, as stated in the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The Act does not include the DOTCOM Act provision, and Congress recommends the Secretary of Defense support the IANA transfer with assurances for the .mil domain. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 states that Congress believes the Secretary of Defense should only support the IANA transfer if assurances are provided for protecting legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers used for national security purposes. The Secretary of Defense should take necessary steps to sustain the successful stewardship of Internet root zone servers for national security purposes, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency in maintaining a free and resilient Internet. The Secretary of Defense should ensure the successful stewardship of Internet root zone servers for national security, transparency, and efficiency. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, which appropriates funds for DOC and NTIA, without including funds for the transition. The Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act does not include funds for the transition of NTIA to ICANN. An amendment in H.R. 4660 prohibits the use of funds for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility. An amendment in H.R. 4660, adopted on May 30, 2014, prohibits the use of funds for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility regarding Internet domain name system functions. H.R. 4660 was passed by the House on the same day. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process. ICANN has an NTIA approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. The committee directed NTIA to report quarterly on the privatization process and inform them in advance of any decisions. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The committee expressed concern about NTIA's lack of advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. They are awaiting a report on NTIA's plans for greater involvement in the GAC to protect U.S. interests. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. The Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) signed on December 16, 2014, prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. The funding prohibition for NTIA's IANA transition activities ends on September 30, 2015. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor for ICANN and IANA matters. The Explanatory Statement accompanying P.L. 113-235 reiterates House and Senate language regarding ICANN and IANA matters. It directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing NTIA's role. NTIA is also required to submit a report within 45 days of enactment regarding potential recourse if a decision is made to transition to a new contract. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations must receive a report within 45 days of P.L. 113-235 enactment regarding potential recourse if transitioning to a new contract for Internet governance is harmful to the United States. Legislation like H.R. 4367 and H.R. 4398 also address the proposed transition. Three bills introduced in 2014 (H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, H.R. 5737) aim to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and IANA responsibilities without meeting specified criteria. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent NTIA from giving up its domain name system responsibilities without meeting certain criteria. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced by Representative Shimkus as H.R. 805, aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress examining the implications of the proposed transfer. The report will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer, NTIA's criteria for the transfer, and all transfer proposals received by NTIA. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805 by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transfer, NTIA's criteria, transfer proposals, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and concerns regarding the security of the Internet domain name system and other information networks. The report will also define the term \"multistakeholder model\" as used by NTIA in Internet policymaking and governance. The GAO is directed to analyze the security of the Internet domain name system and other information networks. H.R. 805 and S.Res. 71 aim to increase public awareness about NTIA's proposed transition in Internet governance. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 designating \"Internet Governance Awareness Week\" to raise awareness about NTIA's proposed transition in Internet governance and emphasize the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 to raise awareness about NTIA's proposed transition in Internet governance and emphasize the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. A hearing was held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to discuss the status of the transition, with testimony from NTIA, ICANN, and others. ICANN has initiated a process for the multistakeholder community to reach consensus on a transition proposal, divided into two parallel tracks: IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN. ICANN has initiated a process for the multistakeholder community to reach consensus on a transition proposal for the IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. A draft proposal includes forming a steering group to oversee the process in an open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable manner. The draft proposal includes forming a steering group to oversee the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions. This group will be composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and parties directly affected by the transition. After receiving public comments, ICANN announced the formation of a Coordination Group responsible for preparing the transition proposal. On June 6, 2014, ICANN announced the formation of the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) comprised of 30 individuals representing 13 communities. The ICG's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal for the transition of the IANA functions. The ICG released its charter on August 27, 2014, stating its mission to coordinate a proposal for the transition of IANA functions. Three proposals for primary IANA functions are being developed by operational communities, with the ICG working on a consolidated proposal. The Domain Names proposal is being developed by the Cross Community Working Group. The ICG is working on developing a single consolidated proposal from three separate proposals. The Domain Names proposal by CWG-Stewardship is still in progress with a target submission date of June 2015. The Number Resources proposal by CRISP Team was submitted to the ICG on January 15, 2015. The Protocol Parameters proposal by IANAPLAN WG is also in progress. The RIRs and IETF submitted final proposals to the ICG in January 2015 for the numbering and protocol parameter functions. However, consensus on a domain name function proposal has been challenging for the CWG-Stewardship group, leading to an extended deadline. Consensus on the domain name function proposal has been difficult for the CWG-Stewardship group, leading to an extended deadline from January to June 2015. Transitioning away from the NTIA contract with respect to the domain naming function is complex and controversial. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability in parallel with the IANA stewardship transition. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability in parallel with the IANA stewardship transition. This process aims to strengthen ICANN's accountability mechanisms to ensure it remains accountable to Internet stakeholders even without the IANA contract with the U.S. government. ICANN has formed a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to enhance its accountability mechanisms in the absence of its historical contractual relationship with the U.S. government. The CCWG-Accountability, comprised of 25 members and 141 participants, will develop proposals to strengthen existing accountability mechanisms. The CCWG-Accountability, consisting of 25 members and 141 participants, will develop proposals to enhance ICANN's accountability. Decisions will be made by consensus, and the group will be open to any interested person as a participant. Additionally, up to seven advisors will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG-Accountability, with 25 members and 141 participants, will not involve advisors in decision-making. Up to seven advisors selected by a Public Experts Group will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams, with Work Stream 1 focusing on enhancing ICANN accountability mechanisms. The CCWG-Accountability, consisting of 25 members and 141 participants, is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams. Work Stream 1 focuses on enhancing ICANN accountability mechanisms within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe, while Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics with a longer timeline. If approved by chartering organizations, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The CCWG-Accountability is pursuing two Work Streams: Work Stream 1 focuses on enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe, while Work Stream 2 addresses topics with a longer timeline. An accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, and the Workstream 2 proposal will be submitted after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. The Workstream 1 proposal is to be submitted to the ICANN Board in June 2015, while the Workstream 2 proposal is to be submitted after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA will need to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to occur. NTIA's role during the transition process has been questioned due to Congress prohibiting the use of FY2015 funds for relinquishing its responsibility. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated at the 2015 State of the Net Conference that they will not use funds for this purpose. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated at the 2015 State of the Net Conference that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN or amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign before September 30, 2015. Congress has made it clear that FY2015 funds cannot be used for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility. NTIA will amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign to remove NTIA's approval role in changes to the root zone file before September 30. Congress expects NTIA to actively monitor and report on the transition process, participating in discussions with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community as it develops the transition plan, participating in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. They will represent the United States at ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee meetings and provide informal feedback. NTIA supports an open and participatory multistakeholder process where all ideas are welcome and transition options can be fully tested. The community should proceed as if it has only one chance to get this right, supporting an open and participatory multistakeholder process where all ideas are welcome. It is important to consider all transition proposal models and ensure that any new organizational structures created are thoroughly evaluated. Administrator Strickling urged the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure new organizational structures are accountable and efficient. NTIA emphasized the importance of stress testing proposed solutions to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. NTIA emphasized stress testing proposed solutions to safeguard against future attempts to influence or take over ICANN, including addressing how to remove or replace board members and improve accountability tools. Both transition processes (IANA function stewardship and accountability) should remain in sync. Stakeholders are losing confidence in incorporating and improving current accountability tools like reviews called for by the Affirmation of Commitments. NTIA stated that both transition processes should remain in sync, with a target date of delivering a transition plan in the summer, but with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership from around the world, including the Board of Directors and various constituency groups. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) is also part of ICANN. The target date for delivering a transition plan is in the summer, with the flexibility to extend the contract if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership from around the world. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides advice to the ICANN Board on public policy matters. There are debates about the U.S. government's authority over ICANN. Many in the international community, including foreign governments, argue that the U.S. government's authority over ICANN is inappropriate. The United Nations debated the issue at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society and conducted a study on achieving greater international involvement in Internet governance. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) debated the issue of international involvement in Internet governance. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) conducted a study and proposed further internationalization of Internet governance, suggesting the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. The report proposed further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. Four models were suggested, including two with new Internet governance bodies linked to the U.N. ICANN could be supplanted or made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body under three of the models. The report's conclusions were to be discussed during the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. During the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005, there was conflict over control of the domain name system. U.S. officials opposed transferring control from ICANN to any international body, while the EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. The conflict was averted by an announcement on November 15, 2005. In 2005, the EU shifted towards supporting an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit over control of the domain name system was resolved by an agreement between the United States, the EU, and over 100 other nations. ICANN and the United States maintained their roles, while the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established as a platform for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. A new international group, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in 2010 for another five years. The U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) was tasked with developing recommendations for improving the IGF. The U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) was tasked with developing recommendations for improving the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). A Working Group on Improvements to the IGF was formed, including 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Controversies surrounding new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD led some governments to argue for increased government influence on ICANN policy development. Controversies over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD prompted some governments to push for more government involvement in ICANN policy decisions. The United States, Canada, and the European Union support the current multistakeholder model but advocate for a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA) prefer a U.N.-based entity to oversee Internet policy, including ICANN. The IBSA group favored creating a U.N.-based Internet policy entity to oversee existing bodies like ICANN. Another group, including Russia and China, proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" promoting multilateral Internet management. The U.N. Assembly released a revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security on January 13, 2015, promoting multilateral, transparent, and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) for equitable distribution of resources and secure functioning of the Internet. The WCIT, organized by the ITU, aimed to revise the ITRs, a global treaty governing international telecommunications traffic. Key focus was on addressing Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The WCIT focused on revising the ITRs to address Internet traffic and governance. The Administration and Congress advocated for the new ITRs to only cover traditional telecommunications traffic and for the ITU not to extend its authority over the Internet. Concerns arose in Congress about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the WCIT. The 112th Congress had concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127, introduced by Representative Bono Mack, expressed Congress's support for a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder model. It was unanimously passed by the House on August 2, 2012. H.Con.Res. 127, passed unanimously by the House on August 2, 2012, supports a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder model. A similar resolution, S.Con.Res. 50, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Rubio on June 27, 2012. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 50 on September 22, 2012, and the House unanimously passed it on December 5, 2012. The resolution supports a global Internet free from government control and advocates for the multistakeholder model. During the WCIT in Dubai, a proposal supported by Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Sudan sought to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance, including the right to manage Internet resources. During the WCIT in Dubai, a proposal supported by Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Sudan aimed to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance. The proposal included an article establishing Member States' right to manage Internet resources. Although the proposal was withdrawn, the ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet,\" emphasizing equal government roles in international Internet governance. Resolution 3, part of the final ITR text from the WCIT in Dubai, emphasized equal government roles in international Internet governance. The United States chose not to sign the treaty due to the inclusion of Resolution 3 and other new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate over Internet governance is ongoing. The United States declined to sign the final ITR text at the WCIT in Dubai due to the inclusion of Resolution 3 and new articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and overseeing efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. Representative Walden introduced H.R. 1580 on April 16, 2013, affirming the U.S. policy on Internet governance. The U.S. government opposes intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 affirms the U.S. policy on Internet governance, passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. The United States supports the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. H.R. 1580 was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives in May 2013. In October 2013, ICANN and other global Internet organizations called for strengthening multistakeholder cooperation to prevent Internet fragmentation at a national level. The recommendations for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation included reinforcing globally coherent Internet operations, warning against national Internet fragmentation, expressing concern over trust erosion due to surveillance, addressing Internet Governance challenges, and accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The Montevideo Statement emphasized the need for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges and called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of Brazil announced plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014, known as NETmundial, to include representatives from government, industry, civil society, and academia. The President of Brazil announced plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014 called NETmundial. The summit aimed to bring together representatives from government, industry, civil society, and academia to discuss Internet governance principles and propose a roadmap for its evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" outlining general principles and identifying key issues. The NETmundial summit focused on crafting Internet governance principles and proposing a roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" that reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's stewardship role of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community. The outcome of the NETmundial summit reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's stewardship role of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community, emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum's mandate, and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation with stakeholders from various sectors to address Internet governance issues. A Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation was formed with stakeholders from government, civil society, private sector, technical community, and international organizations. They prepared a report on principles for global Internet cooperation, proposed frameworks, and a roadmap for future governance challenges. The report, Towards a Collaborative, Decentralized Internet Governance Ecosystem, was released in May 2014. The creation of a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN. The NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The purpose is to apply the NETmundial Principles to enable an effective and distributed approach to Internet cooperation and governance. The NETmundial Initiative aims to apply its principles for effective Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea concluded successfully, addressing general policies and electing officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance. The U.S. delegation at the ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance. However, the conference concluded successfully with member states deciding not to expand ITU's role in Internet governance or cybersecurity issues. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of an address, such as country codes like .us or generic TLDs like .com. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of an address, such as country codes like .us or generic TLDs like .com. ICANN established eight gTLDs before allowing for new applications in 2000 and 2004, resulting in 22 gTLDs currently in operation. Some gTLDs are reserved for specific organizations, while others are open for registration by anyone. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition. In 2000 and 2004, ICANN established eight gTLDs, resulting in 22 currently in operation. Some are reserved for specific organizations, while others are open for registration by anyone. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition. Debate on expanding gTLDs began in 2005, leading to a consultative process by ICANN to develop rules for introducing new gTLDs. The growth of the Internet led to a debate on expanding gTLDs, resulting in ICANN developing rules for introducing new gTLDs. In 2011, the ICANN Board approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be added to the domain name system. In 2008 and 2011, ICANN released iterations of its gTLD Applicant Guidebook. The ICANN Board approved the launch of the new gTLD program in June 2011, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be approved. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a fee of $185,000 required. The new gTLD program has faced controversy, with trademark holders concerned about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. ICANN approved the new gTLD program in June 2011, allowing for hundreds of new gTLDs. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a fee of $185,000 required. The program faced controversy over trademark holders' concerns about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. Governments and law enforcement also expressed concerns about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across new gTLDs. Governments advocated for additional intellectual property protections and more stringent rules in the new gTLD process to combat cybercrimes. Despite some changes, strong opposition from trademark holders and parts of the U.S. government, including Senate and House committees, arose in late 2011. In late 2011, strong opposition from trademark holders and parts of the U.S. government, including Senate and House committees, arose towards ICANN's gTLD expansion. ICANN defended its program, stating it will offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. ICANN did not delay the initiation of the new gTLD program, and the application window was opened on January 12, 2012. By June 13, 2012, ICANN had received 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic name and Internationalized Domain Name applications in scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Cyrillic. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. By June 13, 2012, ICANN had received 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic name and Internationalized Domain Name applications in scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Cyrillic. The evaluation phase will determine the acceptance of these applications, a process that could take 9 to 20 months depending on various factors. The approval and delegation of a new gTLD can take 9 to 20 months, depending on factors like extended evaluation, objections, and string contention. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, with 894 currently in the process. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook, Version 2012-06-04, provides details on the evaluation of new gTLDs. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs are active on the Internet, with 894 in progress. ICANN plans for future rounds of applications with changes to the process. Concerns about domain name abuse arise as new gTLDs go live. Changes to the application and evaluation process for gTLDs will be systemized in the long term. Concerns about domain name abuse, such as trademark infringement and consumer fraud, are raised as new gTLDs go live. ICANN's approach to addressing intellectual property protection and unlawful behavior in the domain name space will be closely monitored. The new gTLD program raises concerns about intellectual property protection and unlawful behavior in the domain name space. Legislation was enacted in the 107th Congress to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 authorized NTIA to require the .us registry operator to establish and maintain a second level domain. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 authorized NTIA to require the .us registry operator to establish a second level domain (kids.us) for age-appropriate content. Legislation for an adult content top level domain name has also been considered in past Congresses. In past Congresses, legislation for an adult content top-level domain name has been considered. Two bills were introduced to require ICANN to establish a mandatory top-level domain for material harmful to minors, but neither advanced. ICANN has also considered adding a generic top-level domain for adult content since 2000. ICANN considered adding a generic top-level domain for adult content since 2000. In 2005, ICANN announced negotiations with a registry company to operate a new \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, which sparked controversy. The creation of a .xxx domain for adult websites was voluntary, with existing sites not required to switch. The announcement sparked controversy, leading to requests for more time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. ICANN faced objections regarding the creation of a .xxx domain for adult content, with requests for more time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. Despite negotiations with ICM Registry, the Board voted against accepting the proposed agreement in May 2006, leaving the possibility open for a revised agreement in the future. The ICANN Board voted against accepting the proposed .xxx domain agreement in May 2006, but left open the possibility for a revised agreement. In January 2007, ICANN published a proposed revised agreement for public comment, but in March 2007, the Board ultimately denied the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to take on ongoing management of Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's rejection of their .xxx gTLD application before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that ICANN's decision was not consistent with neutral and fair policy application. The IRP decision was not binding on ICANN. The Independent Review Panel ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that ICANN's rejection of their .xxx gTLD application was not consistent with neutral and fair policy application. The ICANN Board later voted to allow ICM's .xxx application to move forward. In 2010, the ICANN Board voted to allow ICM's .xxx application to proceed, with next steps including due diligence, negotiations on a registry agreement, and consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. At a later meeting in Cartegena, Colombia, the Board resolved to enter into a registry agreement for the .xxx TLD. At the December ICANN meeting in Cartegena, Colombia, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD, pending consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) due to conflicts with GAC advice. In February 2011, ICANN responded to GAC objections regarding the .xxx registry agreement with ICM. The ICANN Board approved a resolution in March 2011 to establish the .xxx top-level domain, despite objections from the Governmental Advisory Committee. The vote was nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The ICANN Board approved a resolution in San Francisco to establish the .xxx top-level domain, with a vote of nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The .xxx TLD became available to all registrants in December 2011. Concerns about the security and stability of the Internet, including vulnerabilities in the DNS, have been raised. One issue of concern is the vulnerability in the DNS allowing for distribution of false information, leading to users being redirected to fraudulent websites. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been developed to address this, ensuring the validity of DNS addresses through digital signatures. \"Signing the root\" is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks on the DNS. DNSSEC addresses DNS vulnerability by signing data with electronic signatures. \"Signing the root\" is crucial for protecting against malicious DNS attacks. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public input on DNSSEC deployment. NTIA, NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign collaborated on an interim approach for DNSSEC in the root zone. NTIA requested public feedback on its testing and evaluation report. NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign collaborated on an interim approach for deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor on July 15, 2010, and root operators began serving the signed root zone with actual keys. DNSSEC adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide is essential. The root zone trust anchor was published, and root operators started serving the signed root zone with actual keys, making it available. DNSSEC adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators globally is crucial for maximum protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. Domain name registrants are required to provide contact information for the WHOIS database, which has raised privacy concerns among advocates. The WHOIS database contains contact information (phone number, address, email) of domain name registrants, sparking debate over its accessibility. Privacy advocates argue for limited access, while businesses and government entities advocate for public availability. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on WHOIS data. The WHOIS database's accessibility is debated, with privacy advocates supporting limited access and businesses advocating for public availability. ICANN's GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for the public display of WHOIS information, favored by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial user constituencies. At ICANN's June 2006 meeting, opponents urged reconsideration of limiting access to WHOIS data. On October 31, 2007, the GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies. The GNSO also rejected a proposal to allow Internet users the option of listing third party contact information. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies, rejecting a proposal to list third party contact information. ICANN initiated four separate studies of WHOIS in 2011, examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a reveal study. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) recommended studies on WHOIS in 2008, focusing on misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team, established in 2010, issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, including improving data accuracy and access. The ICANN Board approved a resolution in 2012 to redefine the purpose of WHOIS. On November 8, 2012, the ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting, maintaining, and providing access to gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is working on implementing the Expert Working Group report. The Working Group released final recommendations to replace the WHOIS system with a next-generation Registration Directory Service. ICANN is developing next steps for implementation. The domain name system's commercial use has raised intellectual property concerns, leading to the adoption of a dispute resolution policy by ICANN in August 1999. The WIPO was called upon to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions and submit them to ICANN. ICANN adopted a dispute resolution policy in August 1999, to be applied uniformly by all registrars. Registrars must wait for instructions from the domain-name holder or a court/arbitrator before taking action, except in cases of \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting, which are handled through a special online procedure by a neutral panel within 45 days and costing around $1,000. The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy was implemented by ICANN on December 9, 1999, following the passage of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act by the 106th Congress. This act allows courts to order the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" that are identical or similar to trademarks. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, incorporated into P.L. 106-113, allows courts to order the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" that are similar to trademarks. It also provides for statutory civil damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name identifier. This act is a key issue in the debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names, with concerns about potential intellectual property compromise and increased protection costs. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by concerns about intellectual property compromise and increased protection costs. Legislation such as the Protecting Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) aim to address piracy of online content by prohibiting Internet service providers from directing traffic to domain names with infringing content. The Protecting Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) aim to prevent Internet service providers from directing traffic to domain names with infringing content. ICANN's decisions regarding the DNS can impact various Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The key policy question in transferring DNS management to the private sector is how to ensure the achievement of the White Paper. Decisions made by ICANN regarding the DNS can impact various Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The key policy question in transferring DNS management to the private sector is how to ensure the achievement of the White Paper principles, including Internet stability and security, competition, private policymaking, fair representation of the global Internet community, and how various stakeholders fit into this process. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have led some governments to criticize the ICANN policymaking process. Some governments criticize ICANN's policymaking process, suggesting ways to increase governmental influence. They argue for an enhanced role in developing Internet policies that affect their citizens. Defenders of the multistakeholder model question these proposals. The 114th Congress is likely to closely examine NTIA's proposed transitioning of its authority over ICANN and the DNS to a wholly multistakeholder model, which some governments argue against, advocating for increased governmental influence in Internet policies. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will evaluate if the transition is in the best interest of the United States and the Internet, monitor the development of a transition plan, and seek assurances for a stable, secure, resilient, and open DNS without U.S. government stewardship. Congress will monitor the development of a transition plan for ICANN and the DNS, ensuring a stable, secure, resilient, and open system without U.S. government control. They will also assess the potential for increased intergovernmental control over the Internet at telecommunications conferences. Some nations aim to increase intergovernmental control over the Internet, while NTIA and other government agencies work to counteract this threat. The resolution of these issues could significantly impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
