The Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to thinning ice cover, technological advancements, and growing demand for Arctic tourism and resources. It is in the interests of the United States to collaborate with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe shipping in the region. The United States aims to work with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protecting the environment and the needs of Arctic resource users. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect sovereign and security interests, allow access for research vessels, and maintain peaceful relations in the region through international cooperation. The United States supports international cooperation in the Arctic to ensure reliable shipping, invest in mariners aids, navigation, and search and rescue capabilities for sea routes in the region. The United States supports international cooperation in the Arctic to ensure reliable shipping, invest in mariners aids, navigation, and search and rescue capability. For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the Arctic similar to those provided by the Panama and Suez canals. Expanded shipping in the Arctic will present risks to residents, and coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United States interests. Proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways exist. The United States has interests in the Arctic outside its territorial waters, with proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways. The country relies on icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard for research, security, environmental, and commercial interests in the region. The United States has interests in the Arctic and North Pacific regions, relying on icebreaker platforms for research, security, and commercial activities. The need for new icebreakers is crucial due to the aging Polar Class fleet. Additionally, the country's sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may expand with a potential claim for an extended continental shelf. International cooperation for aids to navigation and facilities is also being considered. The United States may grow its interests in the Arctic and Bering Sea regions with a potential claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers and establishing international cooperation for aids to navigation, facilities, shipping regulations, and oil spill prevention is essential for the country's sovereign interests. Beginning these efforts now, with the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is crucial. The completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council is crucial for protecting United States interests in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, given the extensive current use by vessels of many nations. Implementation of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment is essential for protecting US interests in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to negotiate agreements through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations. The International Maritime Organization is encouraged to negotiate agreements among Arctic nations for coordinated action to ensure aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, maritime domain awareness, and search and rescue in the Arctic. Coordination will be done by the Committee on the Maritime Transportation System. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System will coordinate domestic transportation policies in the Arctic, focusing on maritime domain awareness, vessel tracking, and search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates may enter agreements and contracts for this purpose. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates may enter agreements, contracts, or grants with individuals and governments to carry out the purpose of this section. Icebreaking will be promoted for safe maritime navigation as needed. The Secretary of Transportation may conduct demonstration projects. The Secretary of Transportation may conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and train mariners. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015 is authorized for seasonal operations in the Arctic, including reducing emissions and training mariners for ice navigation and prevention of discharges. Appropriations are allocated to the Secretary of the department where the Coast Guard operates for seasonal operations in the Arctic and agreements under subsection (d). The Secretary of Transportation receives funds for demonstration projects. Icebreakers analysis is required within 90 days. The Secretary of Transportation receives $5,000,000 annually for demonstration projects from 2011 to 2015. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must conduct a cost-benefit analysis on extending the service life of icebreakers within 90 days. The Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on extending the service life of existing icebreakers, building new icebreakers, or a combination of both to fulfill federal icebreaking missions. The Coast Guard must analyze the impact on mission capacity and the ability to maintain a presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. This analysis is required for the Federal icebreaking missions of the United States. The Coast Guard must analyze the impact on mission capacity and presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. Reports to congress are required within 90 days after the completion of the High Latitude Study. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit a report with study results and recommendations on Arctic ice-breaking mission requirements to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports with analysis results and recommendations to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports with analysis results and recommendations under section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code, to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. Within 270 days of enactment, the Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to relevant committees assessing the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions for various missions. The Secretary must assess Coast Guard assets, forward operating bases, and infrastructure needs in high latitude regions for various missions. The assessment includes evaluating shore infrastructure, personnel, logistics, communications, and resource requirements for Coast Guard forward operating bases in high latitude regions, as well as the need for icebreaking capability and the performance of current icebreaking assets. The assessment will include evaluating the Coast Guard's high latitude icebreaking fleet's performance, capabilities, material condition, safety, and working conditions. It will also provide a detailed estimate of acquisition costs for necessary assets and shore infrastructure. The assessment will include evaluating the Coast Guard's high latitude icebreaking fleet's performance, capabilities, material condition, safety, and working conditions. It will also provide detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability to ensure current and projected future mission performance. The assessment will include evaluating the Coast Guard's high latitude icebreaking fleet's performance, capabilities, material condition, safety, and working conditions. Detailed cost estimates for renovating, modernizing, and replacing the fleet over a 10-year period will be provided. SEC. 5. ARCTIC DEFINITION. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act refers to the definition in section 112 of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
