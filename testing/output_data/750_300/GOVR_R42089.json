    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies, including tax incentives, have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency. The federal government faces uncertainty in determining the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was consumed by residential sectors. The federal government is uncertain about which policy tools to use for energy efficiency. In 2016, one-fifth of the energy consumed in the US was by residential sectors. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years. Residential energy consumption has fallen slightly in recent years, with per capita energy use trending downward since the mid- to late-2000s. Efficiency gains have helped keep aggregate residential energy use relatively flat or even slightly declining despite the use of more energy-demanding technologies. Despite efficiency gains, experts believe there is still potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector. Concerns persist that consumers may not invest optimally in energy efficiency, leading to debates about the level of investment needed. Increasing energy efficiency could potentially reduce residential energy use per capita. Increasing energy efficiency in the residential sector may not be optimal due to consumer investment concerns. Tax credits are explored as a policy option to promote residential energy efficiency. Tax credits are explored as a policy option for promoting residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers. An economic rationale is provided for these incentives to correct suboptimal investment in energy-efficient technologies. For the 2017 tax year, taxpayers can claim tax credits for residential energy-efficiency and renewable-energy technologies. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit allows for credits on improvements to the building envelope. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements to their primary residence's building envelope and high-efficiency heating, cooling, and water-heating appliances. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of energy-efficient property capped at a specific amount. The Section 25C tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for energy-efficient improvements to their primary residence. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on building envelope improvements and high-efficiency appliances, capped at $500. Taxpayers generally claim the maximum amount for energy-efficient property. The $500 cap applies to claims made in the current year and the prior tax year. The Section 25C tax credit is capped at $500 for claims made in the current and prior tax year. The credit expired at the end of 2017. Another credit, the residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D), allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for renewable energy properties installed on their residence. The residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for renewable energy properties installed on their residence. The credit rate is 30% for 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, with the credit expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit for renewable-energy-generating technologies is not capped. The Section 25D tax credit rate is set to decrease from 30% in 2017 to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit for renewable-energy-generating technologies is uncapped. For more details, refer to Appendices A and B for eligibility specifications and legislative history. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments, known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories may explain this behavior. The \"energy-efficiency paradox\" refers to consumers not investing in residential energy efficiency despite potential savings on heating bills. Economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not make optimal investments in energy-efficient technologies. Consumers may not make optimal investments in residential energy efficiency due to market failures and barriers, such as externalities and principal-agent problems. Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not directly address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Consumers may not invest optimally in residential energy efficiency due to market failures like externalities and principal-agent problems. Market barriers such as capital market imperfections and informational issues also contribute to suboptimal investments. Energy consumption externalities, where costs or benefits are not reflected in market prices, can lead to underallocation of resources for residential energy efficiency. Residential energy-efficiency investment may be underallocated due to externalities like pollution costs not reflected in electricity prices. Lower prices lead to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can help address this issue. Consumers pay lower prices for electricity, leading to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. The adoption of emerging technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Markets fail to consider these benefits, leading to under-adoption of technology. The principal-agent problem can also occur in energy-efficient property purchasing decisions. Market failure can occur due to the principal-agent problem, where there is a disconnect between those making energy-efficient property decisions and the ultimate energy consumer. Landlords and builders may underinvest in energy efficiency if they do not believe the cost can be recovered. Capital market imperfections and the principal-agent problem can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient property. Landlords and builders may opt for lower-cost, less efficient technologies due to uncertainty about recovering costs. Purchasers facing high initial costs may choose less efficient alternatives. Market imperfections can lead households to underinvest in energy-efficient property due to high initial costs and credit constraints, especially for low-income households. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies also hinders consumers from making such investments. Consumers may be hesitant to invest in energy-efficient technologies due to lack of information and uncertainty about future energy prices. Government policies like tax incentives can help address market failures and barriers. Government policies, such as tax incentives, grants, rebates, and regulations, can enhance market functioning in the face of barriers. Energy efficiency investments can also be supported through informational programs like Energy Star labeling. The government can address energy market failures through regulations or mandates and support energy efficiency investments with programs like Energy Star labeling. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, while other incentives like the expired IRC \u00a745M credit also reduce costs. Tax credits such as Section 25C and Section 25D lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, encouraging additional investment in these technologies. Other incentives like the expired IRC \u00a745M credit also reduce costs for producing energy-efficient products. These incentives help address positive externalities and increase awareness about energy-efficiency technologies. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, encouraging additional investment. However, if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to low electricity prices, tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option. Tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option for increasing energy-efficiency investment if electricity prices are artificially low. Allowing electricity prices to fully reflect costs or taxing electricity production generating external costs could be more effective. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs could encourage investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem and are not available to renters. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency, such as Section 25C and Section 25D credits, do not directly address the principal-agent problem. These credits are not available to renters, which means they do not encourage renters to invest in energy efficiency. Landlords also do not benefit from these incentives since they cannot claim the credits for investments made to rental properties. Other tax incentives, like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes (IRC \u00a745L), are more effective in addressing potential principal-agent problems in the market for new homes. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, like Section 25C and Section 25D, do not directly solve the principal-agent problem as they are not available to renters or landlords. On the other hand, tax incentives for energy-efficient new homes (IRC \u00a745L) are more effective in addressing market imperfections. However, tax credits may not be the best option for consumers facing credit constraints. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not be the most effective policy option for consumers facing credit constraints. Policies that subsidize efficiency, like tax credits, can increase the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and benefit societal welfare. However, recent research suggests that such policies might decrease total welfare if adopted by well-informed individuals. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency can increase adoption of technologies and societal welfare. Recent research suggests that well-informed consumers may not benefit from these policies, as they may receive windfall gains. Targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies may maximize the benefits of tax credits. According to research, tax credits are most beneficial when targeting consumers with significant energy inefficiencies. However, these credits may not address all market failures, limiting their effectiveness in promoting energy-efficient technologies. An economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits evaluates their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. The economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits evaluates their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues, particularly focusing on the effectiveness of tax incentives in promoting energy-efficient technologies and their distribution among taxpayers. Residential energy tax credits aim to promote energy-efficient investments, but their effectiveness in driving additional investment is unclear. These tax credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative issues, as highlighted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Residential energy-efficiency tax credits aim to encourage increased investments in energy efficiency. The success of these tax policies is measured by their ability to stimulate additional investments, rather than just rewarding consumers for investments they would have made anyway. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency should lead to additional investments, not just reward consumers for existing investments. Concerns about the effectiveness of these credits were raised in the 1970s when they were first introduced. In 1979, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits, with some Members of Congress expressing reservations about the lack of market incentive and low uptake by consumers. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed concerns about the ineffectiveness of tax credits, stating that they do not provide sufficient incentive in the marketplace. He believes that tax credits do not motivate economic action but rather serve as a year-end reward for actions already taken. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in stimulating additional investment in energy-efficiency property is debated. Some researchers suggest that tax incentives may lead to increased investment, while others argue that the credits mainly result in windfall gains for recipients. The impact of tax credits on energy-efficiency investment remains uncertain. Some researchers debate the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in stimulating additional investment in energy-efficiency property. While some suggest increased investment, others argue that the credits mainly lead to windfall gains for recipients. The impact of tax credits on energy-efficiency investment remains uncertain, with policymakers needing to consider whether they can encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Energy tax credits may not significantly impact consumer purchasing decisions for residential energy-efficiency improvements. The credits may result in windfall gains for consumers already planning to invest in energy-efficient property. Additionally, the savings from tax credits are delayed until tax returns are filed, reducing their incentive power. Overall, tax credits only lower the price of investment in energy-efficient property for consumers. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not provide immediate financial incentives for some taxpayers due to delayed savings and the requirement of income tax liability to offset with credits. This limits the effectiveness of tax incentives in motivating energy-efficiency investments for certain households. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency mainly benefit higher-income taxpayers, as they require income tax liability to offset with credits. This financial incentive motivates these taxpayers to invest in energy-efficient properties. Higher-income taxpayers are more likely to benefit from residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient properties. Tax credits encourage the purchase of high-efficiency equipment and aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. Tax credits for high-efficiency units aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties, targeting homeowners who make energy property investments. These incentives benefit higher-income taxpayers. In 2015, residential energy tax credits were mainly claimed by middle- and upper-income homeowners, with over three-quarters of claims made by those with adjusted gross income above $50,000. These taxpayers also claimed 89.0% of the total value of residential credits. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by tax units with adjusted gross income above $50,000, accounting for 89.0% of the total value of credits. Tax units with incomes below $50,000, although making up 61.4% of all units, claimed only 22.4% of the credits, receiving 11.0% of the total value. The average credit amount increases with income level, with the highest income units receiving approximately seven times more than the lowest income units. Tax units with higher income levels claimed over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits in 2015, totaling 89.0% of the credits' value. The average credit amount increases with income, with the highest income units receiving approximately seven times more than the lowest income units. The nonrefundability feature of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits may limit who can claim these benefits, as the value of a nonrefundable credit cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. Taxpayers with insufficient tax liability in the current year cannot fully benefit from the Section 25C credit, which cannot be carried forward. Higher-income taxpayers tend to claim most residential energy tax credits, limiting access for lower-income individuals. The working poor and lower-income households may not benefit from residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, which are typically claimed by higher-income taxpayers. This limits access to tax credits that could motivate energy-efficiency investments, especially for credit-constrained households. Tax credits reducing high upfront costs for energy-efficiency investments may not be effective if only available to higher-income households. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer, to ensure low compliance costs and increased tax benefit claims. Taxpayers are more likely to claim tax benefits when compliance costs are low. However, there may be a trade-off between easy-to-claim tax credits and overall taxpayer compliance. In April 2011, the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits in April 2011. Specifically, the IRS was unable to verify if individuals claiming the residential energy tax credits had made qualifying energy modifications to their homes. The IRS was unable to confirm the eligibility of claimants for residential energy tax credits due to lack of information on home modifications and third-party verification. IRS Form 5695 did not request necessary details to validate claims before 2011. The IRS Form 5695, used for claiming residential energy tax credits, lacked necessary information to confirm eligibility before 2011. TIGTA found that 30% of taxpayers claiming the credits in their sample were not homeowners, and 5% of claims in 2009 did not show homeownership. The IRS updated the form in 2011 to request additional information about the taxpayer's home. The IRS updated Form 5695 in 2011 to request more information about the taxpayer's home for claiming residential energy tax credits. TIGTA found that almost 800 eligible taxpayers were incorrectly denied $1.5 million in credits due to errors in applying the $500 limit to the 25D credit. The 25D tax credit has no monetary limit but cannot exceed the taxpayer's tax liability. TIGTA found that the $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in taxpayers being denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to let these tax credits expire, with the 25C credit already expired in 2017 and the 25D credit set to expire in 2021. Other policy options for future incentives may be considered. The Section 25C and 25D tax credits are set to expire, with Congress considering letting them expire as scheduled. Future incentives for residential energy efficiency could involve modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Taxpayers may choose not to make eligible purchases after the credits expire, impacting their purchasing decisions. The Section 25C and 25D tax credits are set to expire, with Congress considering letting them expire as scheduled. Taxpayers may choose not to make eligible purchases after the credits expire, impacting their purchasing decisions. Policymakers may choose to extend, expand, or modify residential energy-efficiency tax incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, detailed in legislative history, have undergone changes since 2005. Extending the credit with the $500-per-taxpayer cap may provide limited incentives for homeowners. The credits can be expanded by using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps. The tax credits for residential energy efficiency can be expanded in various ways, such as using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps. These expansions may provide additional incentives for homeowners to make purchases, as shown by the significant growth in credit value between 2007 and 2009. The value of residential energy efficiency tax credits grew significantly between 2007 and 2009. Policymakers could make changes to these credits by reinstating technology-specific caps, introducing an overall cap, or reducing caps. These changes may lead to confusion among taxpayers. Policymakers may consider changes to residential energy efficiency tax credits, such as introducing an overall cap or reducing technology-specific caps. These changes could lead to confusion among taxpayers. Additionally, policymakers could phase out credits for higher-income taxpayers to reduce budgetary costs. Policymakers may consider replacing energy efficiency tax credits with a rebate program or direct cash payments to incentivize consumers purchasing energy-efficient technologies, especially those with limited funds. This alternative approach may have a greater budgetary cost compared to simply letting the credits expire. See Appendix C for more details on the budgetary effects of these provisions. A rebate program could be a more effective way to incentivize consumers to purchase energy-efficient or renewable-energy-generating technologies, especially for those with limited funds or little tax liability. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program for contractors installing qualified energy-efficiency property. In 2010, legislation was introduced to create a rebate program for contractors installing energy-efficient property. The Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of 2010 aimed to provide rebates to incentivize consumers. The legislation passed the House but was not considered by the Senate. Specifications for property eligibility for tax credits are detailed in IRC Section 25C and Section 25D. Appendix A provides technical standards for property to qualify for residential energy-efficiency tax credits in IRC Section 25C and Section 25D. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and reintroduced in 2005, similar to earlier incentives from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation. Energy tax incentives, introduced in 2005, are similar to the earlier incentives of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with components for energy-conservation expenditures and qualified expenditures for solar, wind, and geothermal energy. In 1980, Congress passed the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223), which increased the renewable energy tax credit to a maximum value of $4,000 for qualified expenditures. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created two new temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes, with both credits in effect for 2006 and 2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a 10% nonrefundable tax credit for qualified expenditures on specific types of property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced temporary tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) had specific credit limits for different types of property, with a maximum lifetime cap of $500. The credit could only be applied to improvements on the taxpayer's principal residence. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. The Section 25C credit had a $200 cap for windows and a $500 lifetime cap. The credit was for improvements on the taxpayer's principal residence. Another credit, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), was for qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, calculated as 30% of expenditures with annual limits. The Section 25C tax credit for homeowners introduced in 2006 and 2007 had annual limits for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties, as well as fuel-cell generators. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties was capped at $2,000 per year, while the credit for fuel cells was capped at $500 per year. Qualifying expenditures included those made on any of the taxpayer's residences. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, while Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Section 25C tax credit for homeowners introduced in 2006 and 2007 had annual limits for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties, as well as fuel-cell generators. Property expenditures included those made on any of the taxpayer's residences, whereas qualifying fuel-cell expenditures were limited to the taxpayer's principal residence. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 clarified that all property using solar energy to generate electricity could qualify for the Section 25D credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, expanding the list of qualified energy property. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from Section 25C but added to Section 25D, which was extended for eight years through 2016. The act also eliminated the $2,000 limit for photovoltaic property under Section 25D. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and expanded it to include new technologies like small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property. The $2,000 annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures was eliminated in 2009. The credit for small wind energy was set at 30% of expenditures up to a $500 cap. The tax credit for qualified small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property was set at 30% of expenditures, with caps of $500 for wind energy and $2,000 for geothermal heat pumps. Taxpayers could claim credits for both technologies on their residential properties under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties. The Section 25C credit was extended for two years with a 30% credit for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The technology-specific credit amounts were eliminated, and the aggregate credit cap was lifted. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Section 25C credit for two years, with a 30% credit for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The calculation of the credit was modified to be 30% of qualified expenditures, removing technology-specific credit amounts. The aggregate credit cap was raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, and the $200 cap for windows was eliminated. Taxpayers could claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, the Section 25C credit was extended for two years with a 30% credit for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The aggregate cap for windows was removed, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. The efficiency standards were reduced, expanding the availability of the credit to additional products. Changes to the Section 25D tax credit removed maximum credit caps for every technology except fuel cells, effective from 2009 through 2016. The Section 25D tax credit was changed in 2009 and 2010, removing maximum credit caps for all technologies except fuel cells. These changes were effective until 2016. The number and total amount of credits claimed increased under ARRA, with higher average credit amounts due to the higher credit rate. After the ARRA expansions expired, there was a decrease in taxpayers claiming the residential energy credit, along with the total and average credit amounts. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but with reinstated lifetime limits of $500 and $200. Taxpayers saw a decrease in claiming residential energy credits after the ARRA expansions expired. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year with reinstated lifetime limits of $500 and $200. Certain efficiency standards were restored to prior levels, and technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property were adjusted. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) and the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for additional years, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH) also played a role in extending the credit. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended the Section 25C credit for multiple years, with modifications to qualifying energy-efficient improvements. The PATH Act extended the 25C credit for two years, from 2015 to 2016, and imposed stricter Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021 and adjusted the credit formula. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 under P.L. 114-113, with a modified credit formula. The credit will be 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and will expire in 2021. The 25D credit for solar technologies will be 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and also extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, harmonizing the credit formula with solar technologies. The credit rates for nonsolar technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before the end of 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, aligning with the rates for solar technologies."
