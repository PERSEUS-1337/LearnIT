    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in the 114th Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held multiple hearings related to natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights key aspects of global natural gas markets, including supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Natural gas is seen as a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy because it emits less carbon dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil. The United States has seen a shale gas revolution in recent years due to improved extraction methods. The United States has become the center of the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods leading to increased natural gas resources. Other countries are trying to develop shale gas, but progress is slow outside of North America. If the US and other nations can bring large volumes of natural gas to market competitively, it could have a significant impact on the world economy. The United States has become the center of the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods leading to increased natural gas resources. Progress in developing shale gas outside of North America is slow. The US started exporting liquefied natural gas in 2016, and the future role of natural gas in the global economy depends on factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations. Many countries are closely monitoring the development of US unconventional natural gas resources. The development of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources is being closely monitored by many countries due to factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations. Natural gas is expected to have a greater role in the global energy mix because of its growing resource base and lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels. In 2015, the world consumed 122,442 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with the United States accounting for over 27,463 bcf, or about 23% of the total consumption. In 2015, global natural gas consumption reached 122,442 billion cubic feet, with the United States consuming over 27,463 bcf, the most of any country. U.S. consumption grew by 3%, driven by the rapid growth of unconventional natural gas reserves and production, particularly shale gas. Shale gas now makes up 51% of U.S. proved reserves and 56% of production, leading to a potential shift from a net importer to a net exporter of natural gas.

The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas and the second-largest consumer of energy globally. Electric power generation accounts for 35% of U.S. natural gas consumption, with industrial, residential, and commercial sectors also utilizing natural gas. The rise in natural gas use for power generation is attributed to low prices and policies promoting lower emissions. Demand for natural gas in power generation has doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040. The United States has seen a significant increase in natural gas consumption for power generation, driven by low prices and policies promoting lower emissions. The industrial sector has also increased its use of natural gas, with a 10% rise between 2010 and 2015. With a growing resource base, the industrial sector is expected to have more fuel and feedstock choices, potentially leading to further growth in manufacturing industries like bulk or primary metals. Global proved natural gas reserves currently stand at 6,599,400 bcf. Global proved natural gas reserves amounted to 6,599,400 bcf in 2015, with a 53-year supply at current production levels. Reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, showing success in exploration and recovery techniques. Top 10 reserve holding companies are mostly government-owned. Global natural gas reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, with over half controlled by the top 10 government-owned companies. Russia's Gazprom and Iran's National Iranian Oil Company are major players in reserve holdings. U.S. natural gas reserves in 2015 were 368,700 bcf, representing 5.6% of total world reserves. The development of shale gas has contributed to this growth. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, representing 5.6% of total world reserves. Shale gas development has driven the increase in U.S. reserves, with shale accounting for 51% of proven natural gas reserves in 2014. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. U.S. natural gas production accounted for 22% of total global production in 2015. In 2015, global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. U.S. natural gas production accounted for 22% of total global production. The United States saw a 5.4% increase in natural gas production, attributed to the development of unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. The United States had the world's largest production increase in natural gas, attributed to the development of unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. U.S. natural gas production is continually rising despite low prices, with shale gas production projected to increase by 73% by 2040. By 2040, shale gas production in the United States is projected to increase by 73% to 19.6 tcf, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming more prevalent in the global gas trade, with LNG trade increasing by 1.8% in 2015 and the share of LNG in the global gas trade reaching 33%. Many countries are looking to expand their LNG capabilities in response to the growing LNG trade. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, reaching a 33% share in the global gas trade. Countries like Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in response to the growing trade. The United States shifted focus from importing LNG to increasing domestic gas production, reducing the need for import terminals. The United States shifted from importing LNG to increasing domestic gas production due to rising prices, leading to the need for modification and expansion of existing LNG terminals for export capacity expansion. The U.S. natural gas market is transitioning with increased domestic supply from technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Production has shifted to unconventional resources like shale, coal seams, and tight rock formations, making shale gas economically competitive. Authorization is required from the Department of Energy and FERC for development. Shale gas production has lowered costs, shifting away from traditional gas sources like the Gulf of Mexico to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast. This shift has reduced the need for gas from other areas, leading to lower prices and decreased imports from Canada and elsewhere. The United States has seen a decrease in the need for natural gas from traditional sources like the Rockies and Gulf Coast due to increased production from shale plays such as Marcellus. This has led to lower prices and reduced imports, with the country expected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2017. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The United States has transitioned from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time to Asian markets for U.S. LNG. However, only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal, and no LNG transits have been scheduled through it. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time for U.S. LNG to Asian markets. Only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal, raising questions about the impact of U.S. natural gas exports on domestic prices and the economy. The export of U.S. natural gas raises questions about its impact on domestic prices and the economy, as well as concerns about shale gas resources, development sustainability, and water usage in hydraulic fracturing. The practice of hydraulic fracturing in U.S. natural gas production has raised concerns over water quality, quantity, and wastewater disposal. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess the impact on drinking water, with ongoing concerns about deep-well injection and human-caused earthquakes. The concern over deep-well injection and human-induced earthquakes is linked to wastewater disposal from horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Methane emissions from the natural gas sector are also a worry due to their impact on human health and the environment. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the standards were updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain. Federal standards for methane emissions do not cover all sources. The EPA updated the 2012 NSPS for the natural gas sector in May 2016 to include more equipment in the gas production chain. Federal standards for methane emissions do not cover all sources, and as natural gas production expands in the US, methane pollution may become a significant issue for policymakers. About 30% of natural gas is traded internationally. Global and regional markets for natural gas are becoming more integrated, with about 30% of natural gas traded internationally. Natural gas is primarily transported by pipeline or as LNG, providing flexibility in the final destination. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is traditionally sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the United States where prices are market-based. U.S. LNG exports have pressured other countries to delink their gas exports from oil-indexed prices. Most international gas trade is under long-term contracts, typically 20 years, due to the expensive nature of gas transportation. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Most international gas trade is under long-term contracts, typically 20 years, due to the expensive nature of gas transportation. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market, which is growing. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter through its pipeline network to Europe. The spot market for natural gas is growing, with LNG producers able to sell excess gas on a short-term basis. Russia is the largest natural gas exporter, primarily through its pipeline network to Europe. Qatar leads in LNG exports, with Europe being the largest importing region. Recent developments between Russia and Ukraine have impacted gas trade. The majority of the world's LNG trade in 2015 goes to Asia and Europe. Europe imports natural gas mainly from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, but recent events have prompted the EU to seek more secure sources. Asia relies heavily on LNG, with China increasingly importing gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. China is the primary importer of natural gas from Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have a well-integrated pipeline system. China is heavily reliant on imported gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada being the main recipients of U.S. natural gas. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating an economic incentive for the United States to export domestically produced gas. The export of U.S. LNG has been a topic of debate among policymakers, with questions about its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. In February 2016, the first U.S. LNG cargo was shipped from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana to Brazil. Currently, there is one LNG export terminal in operation with several projects in the pipeline. The export of U.S. LNG has been a focus for policymakers, with questions on its global market impact, geopolitics, and domestic prices. Currently, there is one operational LNG export terminal and multiple projects under construction in the lower-48 states, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska, operational since 1969, primarily supplies LNG to Japan. The United States has several operational LNG export terminals, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan. In February 2016, the U.S. began shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers, fetching higher prices than Sabine Pass exports. In 2014, LNG was shipped to Honolulu, HI for the first time using cryogenic containers, with natural gas sold at higher prices than Sabine Pass exports. Alaska has potential to be a major source of natural gas, with estimates of conventional resources on the North Slope exceeding 200,000 bcf, more than eight times current U.S. gas consumption. Alaska has vast natural gas resources on the North Slope, potentially exceeding 200,000 bcf. However, most of the gas is reinjected for oil production and not brought to market. Officials aim to sell gas internationally as LNG, but face commercial challenges. In 2016, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was signed between the US and several countries. In 2016, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was signed between the United States and several countries, potentially impacting U.S. natural gas trade by expediting permits for exports to FTA partners. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has also been proposed. The United States has an FTA under the Natural Gas Act, granting free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to promote trade and economic growth, addressing market access, regulation, and cooperation rules. TPP and TTIP have not been ratified. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP-21) in Paris aimed to address climate change. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016, establishing measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. U.S. infrastructure may struggle to keep up with growing gas supplies. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016, focusing on emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. U.S. infrastructure, particularly gas pipelines built in the 1950s and 1960s, may face challenges in keeping up with growing supplies. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines could range from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually between 2015 and 2030, posing difficulties due to other infrastructure demands. Other factors affecting domestic and international markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological development, and increased interdependence. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), also known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar comprising 11 natural gas producing countries. Formed in 2001, the GECF accounts for 62% of global natural gas reserves and faces challenges in raising investment for infrastructure due to other demands. Factors affecting the markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological development, and climate and environmental policies. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is a cartel organization based in Qatar comprising 11 natural gas producing countries. Formed in 2001, the GECF accounts for 62% of global natural gas reserves and has limited impact on U.S. natural gas consumption due to the U.S. resource base. Europe is more vulnerable to possible cartel control as it imports over half of its natural gas. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is a cartel organization based in Qatar comprising 11 natural gas producing countries. It accounts for 62% of global natural gas reserves. Canada, the largest source of imported natural gas to the U.S., is not a member. Europe is vulnerable to cartel control as it imports over half of its natural gas from cartel members like Russia and Algeria. However, the current market structure limits supply and price manipulation. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) comprises 11 natural gas producing countries, accounting for 62% of global reserves. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015, with the United States surpassing Russia as the largest producer in 2009. The success of the United States has led to other countries evaluating their natural gas resources, but significant changes would be needed for the GECF to have influence in the market. Most countries lack the resources to develop shale gas like the United States and Canada. The price of natural gas in these countries is determined by the market. The price of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom is set by market hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA. Different categories of consumers pay varying prices, with residential consumers paying the highest. By 2040, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to $7.85 per million. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price in the United States is projected to increase to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) by 2040 due to growing domestic and international demand. This would necessitate more well completions to meet higher production levels. The projection by EIA does not consider potential market changes like new technologies, regulations, or discoveries. The price of natural gas in wholesale contracts is often linked to crude oil prices, despite natural gas no longer competing directly with oil-based products in many markets. This disparity between contract prices and spot prices has increased pressure on gas markets globally. The disparity between contract prices and spot prices for natural gas has raised pressure on gas producers to eliminate this concept. Some producers are now incorporating spot prices into their pricing formulas, reflecting the regional nature of the industry. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices to secure natural gas supplies. Some gas producers are incorporating spot prices for natural gas into their pricing formulas, reflecting the regional nature of the industry. Asia is willing to pay high prices to secure its natural gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses are key contract concepts in the natural gas industry. The natural gas industry incorporates take-or-pay clauses in contracts, where buyers must purchase a minimum percentage of the contracted volume regardless of their actual needs. Destination clauses allow for redirection of cargo to different buyers and destinations, contributing to market efficiency. The industry is facing the question of whether natural gas should become the world's primary energy source in the next decade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a 60% increase in natural gas demand by 2040, with most growth coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. This rise in demand reflects a global shift towards decarbonizing the energy system. In 2040, natural gas demand is projected to increase by 60%, with most growth from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. China's shift towards a services-focused economy will require 85% less energy for future growth. China is transitioning to a services-focused economy, reducing energy needs by 85%. Uncertainty surrounds China's future energy consumption. India is expected to drive global energy demand growth, requiring a significant investment of $2.8 trillion. Natural gas currently accounts for 6% of India's energy supply and is projected to make up less than 10% of its energy mix in the future. India's energy demand is expected to drive global growth, requiring a $2.8 trillion investment. Natural gas currently makes up 6% of India's energy supply and is projected to be less than 10% by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry leads in natural gas demand due to various factors. Government policies on carbon dioxide emissions will influence the growth of natural gas globally, projected to reach 28%. Natural gas usage growth is influenced by capital costs, excess generation capacity, and government policies on carbon dioxide emissions. Globally, natural gas is projected to account for 28% of electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries leading. Production needs to increase to meet demand, driven by unconventional gas resources. Europe is the only region not projected for growth in production. Global natural gas production and growth is projected to increase in every region except Europe, with unconventional gas resources accounting for about 60% of the global supply growth. However, outside of North America, development of unconventional resources is slower and uneven. China has policies to encourage production, but challenges such as limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas may hinder full capacity realization. Global natural gas production is projected to increase globally, with unconventional resources contributing significantly. However, challenges like limited water availability and population density in resource-rich areas may impede full capacity realization."
