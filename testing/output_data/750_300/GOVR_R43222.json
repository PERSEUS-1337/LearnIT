Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs between different regions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal waterways and harbor channels. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, including waterways and harbor channels. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is the main legislation for changing the Corps' Civil Works Program, providing Congress with an opportunity to review harbor maintenance policy. With merchandise trade now accounting for 25% of GDP, decisions on harbor maintenance can have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The current harbor maintenance policy, established in 1986, is supported by a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The tax rate is 0.125% of the cargo or cruise ticket value, generating revenue mainly from imported goods at coastal and Great Lakes ports. The increase in merchandise trade's contribution to GDP to 25% highlights the significant impact decisions on harbor maintenance can have on the U.S. economy. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is 0.125% of cargo or cruise ticket value, generating revenue mainly from imported goods at coastal and Great Lakes ports. The tax revenue goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) for dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. Congress must appropriate funds from the HMTF, unlike other federal trust funds. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is collected from imported goods at coastal and Great Lakes ports, with revenue going into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. Congress must appropriate funds from the HMTF, which has a balance of $8.5 billion as of July 2013. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) collects funds for harbor maintenance, with a trust fund balance of $8.5 billion as of July 2013. In FY2014, the fund is expected to receive $2.05 billion in total income. Proposed bills in Congress aim to double annual spending on harbor maintenance. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. Proposed bills in the 113th Congress aim to nearly double annual spending on harbor maintenance, ensuring that Harbor Maintenance Tax revenues are used for maintenance rather than accumulating in the trust fund account. H.R. 3080 would increase expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) every year, with 80% of the prior fiscal year's HMT collected being spent on maintenance by FY2020. Increasing spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has the potential to reduce funding for other Corps activities, such as harbor construction or flood control. Congress may need to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to compensate for the increased HMTF funding, which could result in less funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. Congress could compensate for increased funding from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) by allocating more funds to the energy and water development appropriation, potentially reducing funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. The HMTF was established in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs related to commercial navigation of harbors within the United States. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to cover operations and maintenance costs for commercial navigation of harbors in the US. Congress defined \"harbors\" and \"inland harbors\" based on their capability to handle commercial cargo. Inland harbors must currently handle cargo, while coastal or Great Lakes harbors only need to be capable of handling cargo. Commercial cargo includes passengers transported for. The definitions of \"inland harbors\" and \"coastal or Great Lakes harbors\" for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) were established in 1986. Inland harbors must currently handle cargo, while coastal or Great Lakes harbors only need to be capable of handling cargo. Commercial cargo includes passengers transported for compensation but excludes fresh-caught fish. Ferries are excluded from the definition of \"commercial vessel.\" The Corps did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the harbor maintenance provisions in WRDA 1986. The Corps did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the harbor maintenance provisions in WRDA 1986. According to its annual reports, the Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. According to the Corps, harbor projects are categorized as \"single-purpose\" or \"multi-purpose.\" Single-purpose projects have all O&M costs covered by the HMTF, while multi-purpose projects only allow recovery of costs related to commercial navigation. High-use ports handle 90% of maritime commerce. High-use ports, defined as those handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1 million and 10 million tons of cargo, accounted for 9% of maritime commerce and received 19% of HMTF spending. Low-use ports had federally funded O&M projects. In FY2013, \"moderate use\" ports received 19% of HMTF spending despite accounting for 9% of maritime commerce. Similarly, \"low use\" ports, handling 1% of all maritime commerce, received 5% of HMTF spending with federally funded O&M projects planned. This allocation of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion. The HMTF debate in FY2012 focused on the allocation of funds for harbors, with concerns about limited federal funding for low and moderate use ports. Commercial harbors generating most HMT revenue receive less funding compared to their economic importance, leading to disproportionate allocation of funds. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds is a point of contention, with concerns about disproportionate funding distribution. H.R. 3080 aims to prevent funds from being allocated solely based on tonnage, while S. 601 appears to prioritize funding for large commercial ports. There are 1,228 eligible waterways for HMTF reimbursement, with 61% carrying no cargo. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds allocation is a contentious issue, with concerns about disproportionate distribution. Out of 1,228 eligible waterways, 61% carry no cargo, and almost 75% handle little to no cargo. The Administration's budget requests for the Corps have favored funding large commercial ports. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocation favors high-use harbors based on cargo volume, not cargo value. This leads to a disproportionate distribution of funds, with most eligible waterways handling minimal or no cargo. A shift to a value-based metric could redirect funding to ports handling container traffic. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocation currently favors high-use harbors based on cargo volume, which may not align with the value of the cargo. Shifting to a value-based metric could result in a more equitable distribution of funds, especially for ports handling container traffic. This change could concentrate harbor maintenance funding on ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland, which collectively handle a significant portion of U.S. maritime container shipments. In 2012, ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland handled 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments. High-use ports received only half of the O&M funds requested in FY2011, while moderate-use ports received 30% and low-use harbors received 10%. Low-use harbors requested $766 million, close to the $922 million requested by the busiest harbors. Low-use harbors received 10% of the funds requested by their district engineers, totaling $766 million, which was close to the $922 million requested by the busiest harbors. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds needed, while economically significant ports received only half of their requested funds. This shortfall is concerning as the busiest commercial shipping channels operated at authorized capacities only 30% of the time in 2008. The Corps faces financial stresses in allocating funds for infrastructure, leading to partial investments across many facilities instead of larger investments in critical ones. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the busiest commercial shipping channels. When measuring harbor traffic by ship capacity, 90% of ship traffic occurs at the top 35 ports, with the top 10 ports accounting for 60% of commercial ship calls. Concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors could benefit national economic interests, but may hinder moderate-use ports from developing into high-use ports due to potential lack of channel depth. The Corps may justify concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors, potentially hindering moderate-use ports from developing into high-use ports due to channel depth limitations. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance every few years. Funding data from FY1999 to FY2008 shows support for HMTF-eligible projects. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance required every few years. Funding data from FY1999 to FY2008 shows support for HMTF-eligible projects. The Corps actively maintains only 360 out of the authorized 1,400 coastal navigation projects, raising questions about the reasons for maintaining fewer projects.

The Corps actively maintains only 360 out of the authorized 1,400 coastal navigation projects. A 2001 letter from two Members of Congress questioned the need for continued maintenance of several Corps projects, prompting a study released in 2003. The study highlighted the lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for federal investment in harbor projects. The 2003 Corps study identified issues with harbor maintenance funding, noting a lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for federal investment in projects. The study highlighted passive stewardship of resources and the need for explicit policy guidance for harbors. The Corps' current policies are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and need explicit guidance for confirming economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago before alternative transportation methods were available. The 2003 Corps study highlighted that many harbor projects authorized decades ago are now bypassed by modern transportation methods. Small harbors once used for maritime commerce are now mainly for pleasure boats. Passengers traveled in small vessels, utilizing many small harbors now used mainly by pleasure boats. The Corps maintains these harbors with funds from a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects. The Corps focuses on harbor maintenance projects of greatest commercial importance. The Corps has shifted focus to harbor maintenance projects of greatest commercial importance, using a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" to prioritize funds based on commercial data. Metrics are now used to group projects, starting from the FY2012 budget justification. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using data on tonnage, value, and ship transits to assess dredging needs. Metrics or \"triggers\" are used to group projects, with criteria including tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, and national security requirements. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using data on tonnage, value, and ship transits to assess dredging needs. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, national security requirements, infrastructure condition, reliability, and legal requirements. The large number of criteria raises concerns about how many projects would qualify for priority funding. The 2003 Corps study lacked clear criteria for prioritizing harbor navigation projects, leading to uncertainty about qualifying for priority funding. The Government Accountability Office recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. Congress is concerned that the Corps' project prioritization criteria are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment, as highlighted in a 2010 GAO report. The 2010 GAO report raised concerns about the Corps' lack of transparent criteria for prioritizing projects, potentially leading to suboptimal investment returns. The audit found that the budget process focused more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, but the Corps clarified that actual performance was considered in the Operation and Maintenance program. The GAO submitted comments emphasizing the importance of assessing actual performance in the Operation and Maintenance program to determine budget priorities. Opportunity cost, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance, plays a significant role in efficiently allocating funds to harbors. It considers whether providing maintenance to one harbor results in a loss of potentially greater economic benefits from another harbor. The Corps' budget guidance does not mention opportunity cost, which involves efficiently allocating funds to harbors based on potential economic benefits. A former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within a national framework for optimal solutions. Costs for operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary significantly among ports. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary considerably among ports, with costs per ton and per vessel being higher at smaller ports than major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, so an average over several years is a better indicator. However, the Corps has not jointly analyzed the datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage. The Corps has not jointly analyzed datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage. The HMTF pays for maintaining federally designated channels, with non-federal sponsors responsible for 50% of costs for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 would change the non-federal cost share requirement. S. 601 proposes changes to the cost-sharing requirements for maintaining harbors deeper than 50 feet. New construction projects are not funded through the HMTF and are paid for from general government revenues. Federal share of construction costs varies based on harbor depth. Construction projects, such as deepening or widening channels, are not funded by the HMTF but from general government revenues. The federal share of costs ranges from 40% to 80% based on harbor depth. General fund expenditures for construction at coastal harbors partially offset HMT collections. Berths and private side channels are not funded by HMTF and are the responsibility of port authorities or terminal owners. S. 601 would allow ports with excess HMT revenue to use funds for dredging berths or removing contaminated sediments. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the HMTF for dredging berths and contaminated sediments at ports with excess revenue, potentially reducing funds allocated to other ports. Los Angeles and Long Beach, leading container traffic ports, would benefit from this provision. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the HMTF for dredging berths and contaminated sediments at ports with excess revenue, potentially reducing funds allocated to other ports. There is wide variation in the amount of HMT generated at harbors, with the top 15 harbors collecting more than 75% of total HMT revenue. The disparity between individual ports' share of HMT revenue and their O&M costs may raise concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors or channels for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. These harbors were authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950 and are allocated O&M funds based on their critical importance. The Corps designates \"critical\" harbors of refuge for small craft, with priority given to those supporting Coast Guard stations, subsistence harbors, and ferry channels. 30 harbors were identified as critical or subsistence to justify O&M funding from FY2011 to FY2014. In FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided an additional $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors, above the President's request. The committees criticized the administration's criteria for navigation maintenance as not allowing for the upkeep of small harbors. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated an extra $30 million for maintaining small, remote, or subsistence harbors, criticizing the administration's criteria for navigation maintenance. They urged the Corps to revise the criteria to consider the economic impact on local and regional economies. The criteria for determining funded navigation maintenance projects should include economic impact on local and regional economies, especially those important for national defense or public health and safety. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the HMTF, identifying 501 projects totaling $63 million annually. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors that did not contribute to the HMTF, identifying 501 projects totaling about $63 million in annual expenditures. This aimed to shift responsibility to state and local governments for maintaining non-contributing harbors, while focusing the Corps on national significance water projects. Earlier, President Reagan had suggested cutting funding for harbors with high federal maintenance costs. The Reagan Administration proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, aiming to save about $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess their own fees for harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess their own fees for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little or no commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy being not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation. The House Committee on Appropriations endorsed a policy in 1954 stating that the federal government is not obligated to maintain navigable waterways that are no longer economically viable. Minimum appropriations have prevented funds from being used on obsolete waterways, but a 1956 audit found that the Corps was still maintaining channels contrary to its policy. In 1956, a General Accounting Office audit found that the Corps was maintaining waterways predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to its policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific criteria for federal navigation projects. 11 coastal projects were identified as of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending in 2011. In 2011, the General Accounting Office identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending. One highlighted project was the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida, recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project to make it ineligible for certain expenditures. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project by the GAO, but it still received about $30 million from the HMTF between FY1999 to FY2008. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received about $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008, but no cargo has moved on this waterway in recent years. The Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas received $17 million of HMTF funds from FY1999 to FY2008. No cargo has moved on this waterway recently. A 2008 Corps study found that recreational boaters on the Great Lakes spent $2.4 billion per year, creating 60,000 jobs. Another study of 18 recreational harbors in Oregon showed that recreational boating supported 1,700 jobs. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes spend $2.4 billion annually on trips and $1.4 billion on vessels and supplies, supporting 60,000 jobs. A study in Oregon found that recreational boating creates 1,700 jobs. Boaters pay federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration and boating safety programs. This funding dates back to before a cargo tax was enacted in 1986. The use of boat fuel taxes for harbor maintenance, including dredging, has been supported by some in the recreational boating industry. The Corps is exploring local financing options for waterways on the Atlantic Coast. However, crucial information on the need for increased spending on harbor maintenance is not publicly available. The Corps is exploring local financing options for low-commercial-use waterways on the Atlantic Coast. However, crucial information on the need for increased spending on harbor maintenance, such as current expenditure reports, is not publicly available. The Corps has been requesting funds for expenditure reports on a project-by-project basis from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. They also collect data on harbor usage and O&M expenses, but there are discrepancies in their database. The Corps tracks tonnage and vessels using channels and waterways but faces discrepancies in facility nomenclature and expenditure databases. They do not compare channel dimensions to modern vessel needs or estimate economic losses from deficiencies. The Corps does not compare shipping channels to modern vessel needs or estimate economic losses from deficiencies. They have established the Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program aims to invest tax dollars wisely in navigation projects that provide long-term value. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects, rather than on maintaining existing harbors and channels. Congress requested the Corps to estimate nationwide average availability in July 2012. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects, rather than on maintaining existing harbors and channels. In July 2012, Congress requested the Corps to estimate nationwide average availability of authorized dimensions for all maintained channels from the HMTF. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109, with a rate of 0.125%. The cost of shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest is around $4,000. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is significant compared to typical freight charges, especially for containers with valuable cargo. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. Imported electronics in a 40-foot container have an average value of $117,606 and are subject to an HMT of $147, increasing shipping costs by about 4%. U.S. ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts cargo to ports in those countries due to the lack of a similar tax. The HMT diverts inbound cargo, especially containerized cargo bound for the Midwest, to ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders. Factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. If U.S. importers were relieved of paying the HMT or if an equivalent fee were imposed on cargo coming through Canadian West Coast ports, shippers would divert 59,000 to 72,500 40-foot containers. The FMC estimated that removing the HMT would divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee paid by shippers. The FMC concluded that not all cargo ports back to U.S. west coast ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee to reduce incentives for shipment through Canada. The HMT may hinder transshipment of import and export cargo by sea. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) poses a serious obstacle to transshipment of import and export cargo by sea. It is levied twice if imported cargo is unloaded at a U.S. port and reloaded on another ship, discouraging coastal feeder service. This results in uncollected HMT of up to $500 million per year from domestic waterborne shippers. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) poses challenges for transshipment of containers at U.S. ports, with up to $500 million per year in uncollected taxes from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. The duty drawback program refunds import duties on parts used in U.S.-made products for exports, ensuring price competitiveness. Exporters don't pay HMT for port use when exporting but do pay on materials transported through ports. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of increased focus on the cost-effectiveness of industrial supply chains. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are concerned about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being sufficient for maintaining competitiveness in the global marketplace. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically enhance the nation's competitiveness. The Corps has been directed to use additional funds for harbors to promote international competitiveness. The Competitive Supply Chain Initiative by the Departments of Transportation and Commerce aims to improve the nation's marine transportation system and overall national freight infrastructure to enhance America's competitiveness in the global marketplace. Supply chain competitiveness impacts the cost of products in the U.S. and the ability to meet global prices. The Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of supply chain competitiveness for national competitiveness, affecting product costs and global prices. It is crucial for policymakers, management, and academics to understand and optimize supply chain management for corporate competitiveness. China emphasizes the importance of efficient supply chain management for corporate competitiveness, aligning transportation infrastructure with strategic priorities. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments. The Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments by aligning waterside and landside infrastructure investment along national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in response to the expansion of the Panama Canal. In 2012, President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors. He also established a Task Force on Ports in his FY2013 Budget to allocate federal investments strategically in response to calls from state and local governments, ports, and maritime stakeholders."
