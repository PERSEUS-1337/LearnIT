The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation (snow and rain), accelerating weather forecast improvements, and prioritizing areas for quick progress with significant impact. The National Weather Service modernization effort aims to accelerate weather forecast improvements by focusing on areas with quick progress and high impact, setting goals for collaboration between agencies and research communities, and providing research grants to institutions. The National Weather Service modernization effort focuses on accelerating weather forecast improvements through collaboration with agencies and research communities, and providing research grants to institutions. SEC. 3 outlines program research priorities. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving forecasts for hurricanes, heavy precipitation, and floods. This includes enhancing landfall location forecasts and hurricane strength predictions, improving winter and rain storm forecasts, and coupling precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction for better flood forecasting. The United States Weather Research Program aims to enhance forecasts for hurricanes, heavy precipitation, and floods by improving flood forecasting through coupling precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction and enhancing forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. Additionally, the program focuses on improving short and medium-range numerical weather predictions and warnings of high-impact weather events, as well as conducting the Hemispheric Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORpex) to fill observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere. The United States Weather Research Program aims to enhance forecasts for hurricanes, heavy precipitation, and floods by improving flood forecasting through coupling precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction and enhancing forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. The program also focuses on improving short and medium-range numerical weather predictions and warnings of high-impact weather events, as well as testing and evaluating advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. Additionally, it assesses societal and economic impacts of adverse weather and identifies methods to deliver weather information effectively. The United States Weather Research Program aims to assess societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluate useful weather information for decision makers, and test research concepts at test bed centers. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluating weather information for decision makers, and testing research concepts at test bed centers. This includes ensuring a connection between weather research and improving the human condition, as well as technology transfer to operational meteorologists. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY PLANNING AND PROCESS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan for weather research, including collaboration with universities and research institutions, identifying needs for weather information, and outlining methods for dissemination. The US Weather Research Program focuses on identifying social, economic, and military needs for weather information, outlining dissemination methods, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, federal agency roles, funding, and any changes made to the plan. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees detailing the five-year plan, federal agency roles, funding, changes made to the plan, and an assessment of plan objectives achieved. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $15,500,000 for fiscal year 2005, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education. For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, $15,500,000 and $16,000,000 respectively are allocated for competitive grants to institutions of higher education under the Education Act of 1965."
