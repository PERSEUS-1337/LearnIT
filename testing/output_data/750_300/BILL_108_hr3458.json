Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes, leads to visual impairment and blindness, affecting a significant number of diabetics each year. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 74, with up to 24,000 diabetics becoming legally blind each year. Most individuals with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy, and the risk increases with the duration of diabetes. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90 percent. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy can help reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas who lack access to in-office eye examinations. Clinical trials show that early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%. Medicare coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is being added to the Social Security Act, allowing for early detection and treatment in underserved areas. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes, meeting technical standards set by the Secretary, and conducted via a telecommunications system by a physician or practitioner. The remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy involves diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. Payment is made regardless of the location of the healthcare provider. Payment for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy is applicable to eligible patients regardless of the location of the healthcare provider, using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health information. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health information. Interim payment will be provided until the final regulation is published. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide payment for retinopathy assessments under a temporary HCPCS code until a final regulation is published. Additionally, a study on reimbursement for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy will be conducted within a year of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the costs of providing remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations on reimbursements under the Medicare program will be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted regarding reimbursements for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under Medicare. Recommendations will be included on the adequacy of reimbursements and whether the study should be repeated. The amendments made by the Act will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment date. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will now cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements.

Failure to meet this requirement must be addressed before the first day of the first calendar quarter following the State legislature's session after the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants can only be used for projects related to designing, demonstrating, and implementing such programs.

Congressional notification is required before making a grant under this section. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 3 days before making a grant under this section. An advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program within 3 years of the first grant. The advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in increasing early detection and decreasing prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy. They will determine if continued or expanded support is warranted and if the program can be useful. The advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in increasing early detection and decreasing the severity of diabetic retinopathy. They will assess if continued or expanded support is needed and if the program can serve as a model for similar screening programs for diabetes-related complications. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 42 months of the first grant under this section, detailing the advisory committee's evaluation.
