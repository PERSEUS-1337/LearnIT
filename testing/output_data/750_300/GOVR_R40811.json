    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is being urged to provide more funding and authority for activities that reduce biomass fuels, such as prescribed burning and thinning, to lessen the severity of wildfires. Federal agencies already have broad but indirect authorities to reduce biomass fuel for wildfire protection. Federal agencies have broad but indirect authorities to reduce biomass fuel for wildfire protection. However, there is insufficient reporting on funding and accomplishments for Congress to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. Insufficient reporting on hazardous fuel treatment funding and accomplishments hinders Congress's ability to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels for wildfire protection. More detailed information on funding sources and results from activities like prescribed burning and thinning is needed to compare benefits and costs effectively. Improved reporting on funding and results for activities like prescribed burning and thinning, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, could enhance Congress's understanding of appropriations for wildfire prevention. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignition sources. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignition sources. Wildfires can range from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Wildfires in temperate ecosystems can vary from surface fires to crown fires, with crown fires being more destructive. The behavior of wildfires is influenced by fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Efforts to prevent crown fires focus on altering fuel characteristics, including moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. The moisture content of biomass fuels significantly affects wildfire behavior and fire effects. It is the most important property controlling flammability as it requires heat to evaporate the moisture for the biomass to burn. Green foliage's moisture content fluctuates depending on weather, while dead biomass contains water at lower levels. Fuel with up to a certain moisture content can still burn. The moisture content of biomass fuels affects wildfire behavior and flammability. Green foliage and dead biomass have different moisture levels. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content can burn in high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized by how quickly their moisture content decreases. Fine fuels ignite easily. Wildfire fuels are categorized by the time it takes for their moisture content to decline. Fine fuels dry out in about an hour, while larger fuels can take up to 1,000 hours to dry out. The different size classes of wildfire fuels are categorized based on their time lag for moisture content decline. Fine fuels dry out quickly in about an hour, while larger fuels like woody twigs and branches can take up to 1,000 hours to dry out. Fine fuels are crucial for spreading fires due to their quick ignition and burn rate, while larger fuels like 10-hour time lag fuels also contribute significantly to fire spread. The different size classes of wildfire fuels are categorized based on their time lag for moisture content decline. Fine fuels dry out quickly in about an hour, while larger fuels like woody twigs and branches can take up to 1,000 hours to dry out. Fine fuels contribute to fire spread due to quick ignition and burn rate, while larger fuels like 10-hour time lag fuels also play a significant role in fire intensity and damage. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in wildfires, with compactness and arrangement of fuels being key factors. Larger fuels with longer time lag for moisture content decline burn intensely but contribute little to the rate of spread. Highly compact fuel beds are more resistant to burning due to reduced ventilation, slowing moisture loss and restricting air flow. The compactness and continuity of fuel distribution are crucial in wildfires. Compact fuel beds resist burning by reducing ventilation and restricting air flow, while continuous fuels are needed for fire spread. Firelines aim to break the continuity of fuels to control wildfires. The continuity of fuel distribution is essential for wildfires to spread. Firelines are used to break this continuity and control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed affect the width of the break needed to prevent fire spread. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and raising temperatures. High winds and steep slopes can bring the fire's convection column closer to the fuel, reducing moisture content and raising temperatures, making the fuel more flammable. Fuel ladders, continuous fine fuels between the ground and tree crowns, help spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Fuel ladders spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire by providing continuous fuels between the ground and canopy. Wind is crucial for initiating and sustaining crown fires, which can increase in intensity and spread with strong convection. Fuel loads vary widely and exclude biomass in some measurements. The quantity of biomass fuels, known as fuel loads, varies widely and includes dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to more than 200 tons per acre. The fuel loads in forest ecosystems can vary widely, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre. Live crown biomass plays a significant role in sustaining crown fires, despite its exclusion from commercially valuable trees. Not all fuel is completely consumed during fires, leaving behind ash and smoke. The density and continuity of live crown biomass are crucial in sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in wildfires, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed. High-intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only a small percentage of larger tree branches and stems. This leaves many large-diameter fuels remaining after a fire. The nature of fuel characteristics and resulting fires is influenced by different ecosystems. Some are adapted to low-intensity surface fires, others to high-intensity crown fires, and some to a mix of both. Some ecosystems have little to no natural wildfire history. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, occurring at least every 30 years. These ecosystems have large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles, with open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Ponderosa pine forests are a classic example of such ecosystems. Surface-fire ecosystems in the United States, comprising grasslands and meadows, are dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine. These ecosystems have sparse small to mid-sized trees, reducing the risk of crown fires. They historically consisted of grasses, needles, and low-growing shrubs as primary fuels. Historically, heavy grazing and logging in the West altered surface-fire ecosystems by reducing grass cover and promoting the growth of less fire-resistant trees like firs and spruces. Effective fire suppression also increased fuel loads in these ecosystems. Logging in the West focused on large pines, leading to smaller, fire-resistant trees like firs and spruces becoming dominant. Fire suppression further increased fuel loads, creating fuel ladders and increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires in frequent surface fire ecosystems. Activities to reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been documented. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. Ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires, with plants that resprout after fires. Crown fires occur in ecosystems with dense, uniform fuels and can be relatively frequent or infrequent. In chaparral ecosystems, fires are less than 50 years apart, while in lodgepole pine forests, fires can be 200 years apart. Most trees are killed in crown fires, but new stands establish in burned areas. Crown fires are infrequent, occurring every 200 years or more, and most trees are killed. Lodgepole pine is a classic example of a species that regenerates after fires. These ecosystems make up 42% of wildlands in the US and have been impacted by human activities like grazing and fire suppression. Crown-fire ecosystems, which make up 42% of wildlands in the US, have large biomass fuel volumes. Human activities like grazing and fire suppression have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatment efforts have shown to be ineffective in reducing the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires, especially in southern California chaparral. The ineffectiveness of fuel treatment in reducing catastrophic crown fires in southern California chaparral ecosystems is noted. Wildfires in crown-fire ecosystems are patchy, leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. Crown fires in ecosystems like Yellowstone can be patchy, with some areas remaining unburned or lightly burned. For example, during the 1988 Yellowstone fires, only about half of the reported burned acres were severely burned, with the rest experiencing low-intensity surface fires. This patchy burning pattern is common in crown fire ecosystems. In crown fire ecosystems like Yellowstone, only about half of the reported acres burned were severely affected, with the rest experiencing low-intensity surface fires. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires mixed with low-intensity surface fires, typically having an array of fuel sizes and discontinuous crown canopies to halt the spread of crown fires. Whitebark pine is a classic example of such ecosystems, where slow growth moderates the micro-climate to allow other species to germinate and grow. Whitebark pine, a slow-growing species limited to high elevation sites, moderates micro-climate to allow other species to grow. Mixed-intensity fires kill competing species, with Clark's nutcrackers spreading seeds for regeneration in burned areas. Mixed-fire-regime types can occur in ecosystems where different species naturally mix, such as ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir on moist sites or lodgepole pine on dry sites. These species play a role in seed dispersal and regeneration in burned areas. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems can occur where different tree species naturally mix, like ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir on moist sites or lodgepole pine on dry sites. It is uncertain how fuel reduction activities would impact these ecosystems and if they would alter wildfire severity. It is unclear if fuel reduction activities would significantly alter wildfire extent or severity in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems with different tree species. Reducing fuel loads may not benefit protecting structures. Reducing fuel loads may not benefit protecting structures and communities from wildfires, as evidenced by the Hayman Fire in 2002 where 53% of homes were destroyed in association with torching or crown fire. The Hayman Fire in 2002, the largest wildfire in Colorado history, demonstrated the limited effectiveness of reducing fuel loads in protecting homes. 53% of homes were destroyed by torching or crown fire, while 47% were destroyed by surface fire or firebrands. Despite high-severity burns, 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed. Reducing fuel loads can help limit the extent of wildfires in surface-fire ecosystems. However, expanding the area burned in low-intensity surface fires is also important to maintain natural conditions. Eliminating fuel ladders is crucial for the safe use of low-intensity wildfires and prescribed fires in these ecosystems. Various methods have been suggested for reducing fuel loads. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders are necessary for safe use of low-intensity wildfires and prescribed fires in surface-fire ecosystems. Proposed activities include prescribed burning, thinning, release, pruning, and salvage logging. However, some caution that thinning and prescribed fires may not always reduce the risk of crown fires by modifying understory microclimate previously buffered by overstory vegetation. Thinning and prescribed fires can alter understory microclimate, potentially increasing surface fire intensity and the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning involves deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. Fire is a self-sustaining chemical reaction, and if conditions change, prescribed fires can escape control and cause extensive damage. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. If conditions change, prescribed fires can escape control and cause extensive damage. Some observers include naturally occurring fires allowed to burn within acceptable areas and conditions as prescribed burning. Agencies use the term wildland fire use for such fires, treating the acres burned as fuel reduction. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels through burning and decomposition, converting biomass to smoke and ashes. However, it has limitations as it has little effect on large diameter fuels. Prescribed burning converts biomass to smoke and ashes, eliminating fine and small fuels. However, it has limitations as it does not affect large diameter fuels and is not selective in reducing tree density or crown density. There are risks involved as escaped prescribed fires can lead to wildfires with potential loss of property and lives. Prescribed burning is risky due to potential wildfires, leading to high implementation costs and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies like the Forest Service and BLM are cautious in their approach. Federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow wildfires to burn with monitoring, known as wildland fire use, to achieve fire management objectives. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn,\" is a practice that allows wildfires to burn with monitoring instead of aggressive suppression efforts. The effects and risks are similar to prescribed burning, with the main difference being the source of ignition. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, which can be done for commercial purposes. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removal of trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. Different approaches to thinning include low thinning, which removes small and poorly formed trees, and crown thinning. Thinning alters biomass fuels depending on the method used and the handling of leftover biomass on the site. Thinning alters biomass fuels based on the approach used: Low thinning removes small trees, Crown thinning removes larger trees to stimulate growth, and Selection thinning removes less desirable trees. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled and allows for selective cutting. Thinning is a controlled method that can selectively remove less desirable trees, improve stand structure, and reduce crown density. It is more precise in creating targeted stand structure compared to prescribed burning. Thinning, especially focusing on smaller trees and shrubs, can effectively reduce vertical fuels. Thinning, whether in a commercial or precommercial setting, can effectively reduce vertical fuel continuity and target specific fuel components. However, it leaves slash on the ground, which can increase the risk of fires. Thinning reduces fuel continuity and targets specific fuel components, but leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load. Slash treatment is necessary for fuel reduction, with labor-intensive methods like lop-and-scatter, pile-and-burn, and chipping being common. Thinning may not always aim to reduce biomass fuels, as it can also be used to increase forest health. Thinning in forests can be done to reduce fuel continuity and promote the growth of desired trees, but it can also leave slash on the ground, increasing fire hazards. Common slash treatments like lop-and-scatter, pile-and-burn, and chipping are labor-intensive and costly. Thinning may not always aim to reduce biomass fuels, as it can concentrate growth on fewer stems to produce larger, more valuable trees. However, in crown-fire ecosystems, thinning may not provide effective wildfire protection. Thinning in forests can leave slash on the ground, increasing fire hazards. In crown-fire ecosystems, thinning may not provide effective wildfire protection. Thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires. Thinning in forests can increase fire hazards by leaving slash on the ground. Combining thinning with prescribed burning can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires, but the effectiveness of this approach is limited and costly. Other activities like logging, especially salvage logging of dead trees, are sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads. Commercial logging focuses on removing large standing trees. Commercial logging, particularly salvage logging of dead trees, is suggested to reduce fuel loads. However, it mainly focuses on removing large standing trees and does little for fuel ladders, leaving substantial volumes of slash. The proposal that commercial logging can reduce canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Commercial logging, focusing on large trees, may not effectively reduce canopy fires as it neglects fuel ladders. Salvage of standing dead trees could help reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires. Pruning trees can also alter fire behavior. Standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce crown density and fuel ladders, but leaves slash on the ground that can increase fire intensity. Five federal agencies, including the Forest Service, are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands. Five federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands. None of the agencies are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels, but they are implicitly authorized to do so for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect the lands. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been implicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect lands. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been authorized to manage public lands to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the management of public lands to protect various values and provide habitat for wildlife.

The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the management of public lands to protect various values and provide habitat for wildlife. FWS and BIA also have broad management directions for conservation, management, and restoration of fish, wildlife, plant resources, and habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Indian forest land management activities include forest land development. The BIA has explicit direction for Indian forest land management activities, including forest development, protection against wildfire, and biomass fuel reduction activities. The Forest Service has funding programs for biomass fuel reduction activities, primarily through the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. The Forest Service's Hazardous Fuels sub-account is the main source of funding for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities. Funding increased significantly in FY2001 and continued to rise steadily. Specific details on how the funding is allocated and which ecosystems the activities occur in are not reported. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly in FY2001 and continued to rise steadily through FY2008, with a spike in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. Funding has since declined, with thinning activities funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item. Ecosystem-specific details on activities are not reported. In recent years, funding for thinning activities has increased to over half of the FY2009 total. Thinning is funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System, along with reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management. Approximately 20% of appropriations in FY2008 went towards thinning and related activities, but the amount allocated for thinning varies annually. In FY2008, 20% of funding for thinning and related activities came from the Vegetation and Watershed Management account. The portion used for thinning varies annually, and the specific amount funded through Vegetation Management for wildfire protection is unknown. The FS also has a Brush Disposal account funded by timber purchasers for slash treatments in national forests. The Brush Disposal account collects deposits from timber purchasers to treat slash from logging operations in national forests, including mechanical and manual efforts, and prescribed burning. These activities aim to reduce fire hazards, although not always counted as fuel reduction efforts. Slash treatment on timber sale areas is funded through the Brush Disposal account to reduce fire hazards. The Knutson-Vandenberg Fund collects deposits from timber purchasers for reforestation and forest improvement after logging operations. These funds can be used similarly to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations.
