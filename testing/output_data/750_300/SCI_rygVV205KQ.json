This work uses imitation learning to address challenges in learning a representation of the world from pixels and exploring efficiently with rare reward signals. Adversarial imitation can work well in high-dimensional observation spaces, with a tiny adversary acting as the reward function. This approach removes limitations of contemporary imitation methods, requiring only video input and basic GAN training for the adversary. Our approach utilizes a learned reward function with minimal parameters, trained using a basic GAN formulation. It overcomes limitations of traditional imitation methods by not needing demonstrator actions, special initial conditions, or explicit tracking of demos. The proposed agent excels in solving a challenging robot manipulation task solely from video demonstrations and sparse reward, outperforming non-imitating agents and learning faster than competing approaches relying on hand-crafted dense reward functions. Our agent learns faster than competing approaches that rely on hand-crafted dense reward functions and outperforms non-imitating agents. Additionally, a new adversarial goal recognizer allows the agent to learn stacking purely from imitation, without any task reward. In this work, the GAIL algorithm can handle high-dimensional pixel observations with a single layer discriminator network. Using a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent improves efficiency by utilizing a replay buffer for past experiences. The Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent improves efficiency by utilizing a replay buffer for past experiences. Different types of features, such as self-supervised embeddings and value network features, can be successfully used with a tiny, single-layer adversary. In experiments with the D4PG agent, various embeddings and value network features were used to solve a robotic block stacking task using only demonstrations and a sparse binary reward. This approach reduced the dependency on dense, staged task rewards and true state information. The paper introduces a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent that learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards. It outperforms a behavior cloning agent with an equivalent number of demonstrations, achieving a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. The paper introduces a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent that learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards. It achieves a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. Additionally, an adversary-based early termination method for actor processes improves task performance and learning speed. An agent that learns with no task reward using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary achieves 55% stacking success from video imitation only. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement.

Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement. The curr_chunk discusses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with states, actions, reward function, transition distribution, and discount. It explains the goal of training an agent to find a policy that maximizes expected rewards. DDPG BID23 is an actor-critic method involving the actor (policy) and critic (action-value function). DDPG BID23 is an actor-critic method where the actor and critic are neural networks. New transitions are added to a replay buffer for better exploration. The action-value function is trained to match 1-step returns by minimizing the transition sampled from the replay buffer. Target actor and critic networks are parameterized by \u03c6 and \u03b8. The policy network is trained to maximize the action-value function using gradient descent. D4PG builds on the basic DDPG agent with additional improvements. Building on the basic DDPG agent, the D4PG agent uses gradient descent to maximize the action-value function. In GAIL, a reward function is learned by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. GAIL is related to MaxEnt inverse reinforcement learning. The D4PG agent is used to make use of all available training data. The GAIL algorithm involves training a discriminator to distinguish between agent and expert transitions, closely related to MaxEnt inverse reinforcement learning. To utilize all training data, a D4PG agent with experience replay is used, updating the actor, critic, and reward function jointly. The GAIL algorithm trains a discriminator to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. A modified equation is used for the discriminator, which must distinguish expert transitions from those produced by previous agents. The reward function combines imitation reward and sparse task reward. The discriminator does not use actions, only videos of the expert. The reward function in the GAIL algorithm combines imitation reward and sparse task reward, with the imitation reward bounded between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function. Pseudocode for actor and learner processes is included, with multiple CPU actor processes used in parallel. The GAIL algorithm combines imitation reward and sparse task reward, with the imitation reward bounded between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function. Actor processes use early termination when the discriminator score is below a threshold to prevent drifting from expert trajectories. Multiple CPU actor processes are used in parallel, with updated network parameters received every 100 acting steps. The GAIL algorithm uses early termination based on a threshold \u03b2 to prevent the agent from deviating too far from expert trajectories. The type of network used in the discriminator is a critical design choice, as too much capacity can make it too easy to distinguish agent from expert. The GAIL algorithm uses early termination with a threshold \u03b2 to prevent agent deviation from expert trajectories. Discriminator architecture is crucial, as too much capacity makes it easy to distinguish agent from expert. Expert demonstrations provide valuable data for feature learning. In this work, expert demonstrations are used as a valuable data source for feature learning. Access to expert actions is not assumed, ruling out behavior cloning. High-resolution images are used, so feature learning through pixel prediction is not pursued to avoid missing long-term data structure. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is chosen for representation learning in this work. It maps observations into a latent space for long-term predictions using a probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling. This approach is preferred over pixel prediction for high-resolution images to capture long-term data structure. In this work, CPC is used for representation learning, mapping observations into a latent space for long-term predictions with a probabilistic contrastive loss. This approach eliminates the need for task rewards by swapping them with a neural network goal. In this work, CPC is used for representation learning, mapping observations into a latent space for long-term predictions with a probabilistic contrastive loss. Beyond moving from hand-crafted dense staged rewards to sparse rewards, the idea is to replace task rewards entirely with a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories. However, there is a concern that the agent could exploit blind spots in the goal recognizer to receive imitation rewards without solving the task. To address this issue, a proposal is made to replace the sparse task reward with another discriminator. To address the concern of agents exploiting blind spots in the goal recognizer for imitation rewards, a proposal is made to replace sparse task rewards with a secondary goal discriminator network. This network detects if an agent reaches a goal state defined as a state in the latter 1/M proportion of expert demonstrations. The modified reward function includes the secondary goal discriminator network D goal, which operates on the same feature space as the primary discriminator D. Training D goal is similar to training D. In experiments with M = 3, the reward function is modified to include a secondary goal discriminator network D goal. This network operates on the same feature space as the primary discriminator D but focuses on recognizing goal states. By training D goal to detect goal states, an agent can surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster. The imitation learning method bounds agent performance by the demonstrator's skill. Training a second discriminator to recognize goal states allows the agent to surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster. The environment includes a Kinova Jaco arm with 9 degrees of freedom and two blocks on a tabletop. The Kinova Jaco arm has 9 degrees of freedom, controlled by policies setting joint velocity commands. Observations are 128x128 RGB images. Demonstrations were collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller, with 500 episodes for each task. Another 500 trajectories were gathered for validation. The Jaco arm was controlled by a human operator using a 3D motion controller to gather 500 episodes of demonstrations for each task. Another 500 trajectories were collected for validation, and a dataset of 30 \"non-expert\" trajectories was collected for CPC diagnostics. Additionally, demonstrations were collected for a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite BID33 using a D4PG agent trained from proprioceptive states to match a target velocity. The second environment involves a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite BID33. Demonstrations were collected using a D4PG agent trained to match a target velocity from proprioceptive states. The imitation method is compared to D4PG and GAIL agents on dense and sparse rewards, showing favorable results. In comparison to D4PG and GAIL agents on dense and sparse rewards, our imitation method using a tiny adversary shows favorable results. The Conditional Predictive Coding (CPC) model accurately predicts future observations for expert sequences but not for non-expert sequences. Conditioning on k-step predictions improves our method's performance on stacking tasks when the discriminator also utilizes CPC embeddings. Our method shows superior performance on stacking tasks by conditioning on k-step predictions, even outperforming D4PG with sparse rewards. The agent using value network features learns quickly, surpassing CPC features in reaching comparable performance. The agent using value network features learns quickly and outperforms CPC features, reaching comparable performance. GAIL with tiny adversaries on random projections achieves limited success, while GAIL from pixels performs poorly. The discriminator network has 128 parameters with CPC features and 2048-dimensional with value network features. The regularizing effect of norm clipping may explain why GAIL value features work better than pixel features. The discriminator network has 128 parameters with CPC features and 2048 parameters with value network features. The regularizing effect of norm clipping may explain why GAIL value features work better than pixel features. Another agent \"GAIL -pixels + clip\" with norm clipping did not succeed in Jaco or Walker2D tasks. Additionally, temporal predictions from CPC can be used as input to the discriminator. In addition to using CPC features as input to the discriminator, temporal predictions made by CPC can also be utilized. Querying CPC about future expert states and visualizing CPC features learned from training trajectories can provide insights for improving performance in tasks like Jaco and Walker2D. Adding layers to the discriminator network does not enhance performance, and early termination is crucial for optimal results. In Jaco stacking ablation experiments, adding layers to the discriminator network does not improve performance, and early termination is essential. With 60 demonstrations, the agent can learn stacking as well as with 500. The previous Jaco arm experiments showed poor performance when learning a discriminator directly on pixels. A tiny discriminator may be optimal for imitation learning. In ablation experiments, adding layers to the discriminator network does not improve performance. Early termination is crucial for learning tasks. A small discriminator on meaningful features is optimal for imitation learning. Early termination criterion is introduced to stop an episode when the discriminator score becomes too low, showing that disabling early stopping results in slower learning. The average episode length during training is plotted to illustrate why this helps learning, with the discriminator initially struggling to distinguish expert from agent trajectories. As training progresses, most trajectories are stopped early on, leading to improved imitation learning by the agent. The discriminator struggles to differentiate between expert and agent trajectories, leading to longer episodes initially. After 6000 episodes, the agent improves in imitation. Data efficiency is demonstrated with 60, 120, 240, and 500 expert demonstrations, showing that even 60 demos yield good performance. The proposed method shows good data efficiency with as few as 60 expert demonstrations. Results on the planar walker demonstrate that the conventional GAIL struggles to learn, while the proposed method using value network features and random projections successfully learn to run. Videos of the trained agent are available in the supplementary materials. The proposed method using value network features and random projections successfully learns to run, achieving a 55% success rate without any task reward. Videos of the trained agent are included in the supplementary materials. The proposed method with \u03b1 = 0.5 in the imitation reward function achieved a 55% success rate without task reward. The agent learns to stack efficiently compared to the human teloperator. An agent exploit is observed where the top block is rolled to the background to fake a completed stack. Leveraging expert demonstrations to enhance agent performance is a common practice in robotics. The agent exploit involves rolling the top block to the background to fake a completed stack. Leveraging expert demonstrations to improve agent performance is common in robotics. The task involves using pixel observations without access to both states and actions. Imitation learning is a popular approach in robotics, leveraging expert demonstrations to improve agent performance using pixel observations. The task does not assume access to both states and actions, focusing on taking actions based on visual input. Deep learning has been successful in tasks beyond computer vision, extending to interacting with environments through actions. Supervised imitation learning, also known as BID27, is a simple yet effective method in this setting. Imitation learning in robotics leverages expert demonstrations to improve agent performance using pixel observations. BID10 extends this to one-shot imitation, inferring behaviors from single demonstrations via an encoder network and replicating them on new problem instances. This approach successfully stacks blocks into target arrangements on a simulated Fetch robot. BID12 uses a gradient-based meta approach instead of attention. The approach aims for the agent to learn by interacting with the environment rather than supervised learning, unlike behavioral cloning which replicates desired behavior from scripted demonstrations. Our approach on a PR2 robot differs from behavioral cloning by focusing on the agent learning through interaction with the environment rather than supervised learning. Behavioral cloning can lead to cascading failures when the agent encounters states not observed in expert trajectories, requiring many demonstrations and limiting generalization. Instead of behavior cloning, BID38 BID25 ; BID0 suggest inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a solution. Instead of behavior cloning, BID38 BID25 ; BID0 propose inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn a reward function from demonstrations and optimize it using reinforcement learning. DQfD and DPGfD are extensions that incorporate expert trajectories to train agents more effectively. BID26 extended DQfD to handle sparse-exploration Atari games, while BID36 developed DPGfD which uses expert data and agent experience to solve tasks without access to expert actions. GAIL applies adversarial learning to imitation tasks following the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in image generation. GAIL applies adversarial learning to imitation tasks, aiming to solve hard exploration problems with sparse rewards in high-dimensional input spaces. The use of minimal adversaries on top of learned features helps successfully solve sparse reward tasks. Our contribution involves using minimal adversaries on top of learned features to solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces. Additionally, we focus on learning compact representations for imitation learning using expert observations, and utilize self-supervised features to bridge the domain gap between first and third person views. Our approach differs from others by learning the task using all available expert trajectories. Our approach involves utilizing self-supervised features to bridge the domain gap between first and third person views. We focus on learning compact representations for imitation learning using expert observations and aim to generalize all possible initializations of a hard exploration task. By leveraging static and dynamic features, we successfully train block stacking agents from sparse rewards on pixels. The text discusses the use of self-supervised features like contrastive predictive coding and dynamic value network features to train block stacking agents from sparse rewards on pixels. It also mentions supplementary videos of the learned agents and compares their performance to a pure supervised baseline model. The behavior cloning model includes a residual network pixel encoder, LSTM, and linear layer for action output. Stacking accuracy is around 15%. The model consists of an encoder mapping observations to a latent representation and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector.

The model consists of an encoder mapping observations to a latent representation and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector. The visualization of CPC on video data shows two parts: an encoder mapping observations to a latent representation and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector. The model optimizes the loss function by maximizing mutual information between future latent predictions and the context vector. The weights W k for the bilinear mapping z t+k W k c t are learned and depend on the number of latent steps predicted in the future. By optimizing L CPC, the mutual information between z t+k and c t is maximized, resulting in common variables being embedded into compact representations. This is useful for extracting slow features, especially when z t+k and c t are far apart in time. The proposed approach involves model learning via contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and training the agent using CPC future predictions. The proposed approach involves model learning via contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and training the agent using CPC future predictions. Reward functions are defined with five stages for dense staged reward and two stages for sparse reward. Each episode lasts 500 time steps without early stopping. The dense staged reward system consists of five stages with corresponding rewards, while the sparse reward system has two stages with rewards. The actor and critic share a residual network with convolutional layers and normalization techniques. The actor and critic share a residual network with twenty convolutional layers, instance normalization, and exponential linear units. They use independent three-layer fully connected networks with exponential linear units. Distributional Q functions are adopted instead of a scalar state-action value function, with a categorical representation of Z. In this paper, Distributional Q functions are used instead of scalar state-action value functions. A categorical representation of Z is adopted, with fixed atoms bounded between V min and V max. The bootstrap target is computed with N-step returns, constructing a target Z with a different support than Z. In this approach, a bootstrap target Z is constructed using N-step returns, with a categorical projection \u03a6 to ensure a different support than Z. The loss function for training distributional value functions involves cross entropy, and distributed prioritized experience replay is used for stability and learning efficiency."
