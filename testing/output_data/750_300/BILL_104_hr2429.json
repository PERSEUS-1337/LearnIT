The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for agricultural producers to maintain prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as many such lands are being converted to nonagricultural uses due to a lack of viable options for retention. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as states and local governments have not been able to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production on such lands. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands, as states and local governments lack sufficient incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production on such lands. The Farms for the Future Act of 1990 is amended to include a new section on federal cost sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements. The section defines \"qualifying farmland\" as land important for agriculture and at risk of conversion, and \"farmland protection easement\" as an easement related to farmland protection. The term 'farmland protection easement' refers to an easement that restricts land use incompatible with agriculture and binds all future landowners in eligible states with approved programs. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States with approved programs for acquiring farmland protection easements to retain qualifying farmland in agricultural use. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to protect qualifying farmland from incompatible uses or for similar programs. Grants are made on a 50-50 matching basis, with the possibility of up to 90 percent funding from the Secretary. Matching grants under subsection (c) are provided on a 50-50 matching basis, but the Secretary has the discretion to offer grants for up to 90 percent of the cost of acquiring farmland protection easements by eligible States actively involved in farmland protection programs. An eligible State is limited to receiving no more than 10 percent of the total amount available for matching grants in a fiscal year. In providing assistance under this section, the Secretary ensures that funds are used by eligible States to protect qualifying farmland, with priority given to lands of greatest importance to the State. The Secretary ensures that funds are used by eligible States to protect qualifying farmland, with priority given to lands of greatest importance to the State. Funds provided should not exceed fair market value for farmland protection easements. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
