The Congress acknowledges the devastating impact of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia, highlighting the potential risk of a similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years. Scientists predict a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major seismic event occurring, which could result in significant damage from both an earthquake and a tsunami. A major seismic event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone is predicted to occur in the next 50 years, potentially causing a large earthquake and tsunami, leading to extensive damage to infrastructure and emergency services. Coastal communities have shown a lack of preparedness for such an event despite numerous false alarms in the past year. The purpose and goals of the document are outlined in Section 3. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) awards grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program aims to assist departments lacking resources in preparing for, mitigating, and responding to tsunami hazards. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) provides grants to support departments in preparing for, mitigating, and responding to tsunami hazards. Improving warning systems for coastal communities enhances overall hazard capabilities. The CHAMP program provides grants to support departments in preparing for, mitigating, and responding to tsunami hazards. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or greater likelihood within 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency services providers. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, and reinforcing buildings to maintain critical services. The grant funds can be used to reinforce buildings like police stations, fire stations, hospitals, and shelters to maintain critical services. It also includes post-tsunami shelters, supplies, and outreach programs for educating residents and tourists on tsunami types and reactions. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving areas with populations over 50,000 must provide 20% of the project cost with non-Federal funds. For populations between 20,001 and 50,000, departments must provide 10% of the total cost. Emergency management departments serving areas with populations under 20,000 must provide 5% of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for a grant under this Act. In-kind contributions from the department can also be considered for up to 50% of the total project costs. In-kind contributions from emergency management departments can be considered for up to 50% of the non-Federal share of project costs under this Act. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning and managing emergencies. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states.
