    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure producers of agricultural commodities in the US against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, and fire. The insurance provided by the Board covers loss of agricultural commodities due to various unavoidable causes such as drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, lightning, fire, excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease. Insurance period does not extend beyond the time the insured commodity is in the field, except for tobacco. The Board determines insurance coverage period for agricultural commodities, excluding tobacco. Aquacultural species are covered in their production environment. Yield insurance must adhere to standard coverage guidelines. The term 'field' refers to the production environment of a commodity. Standard yield coverage for insurance must protect against 75% of the average yield on the insured farm. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including a 50 percent coverage option based on the average yield of the insured farm. Adjustments may be made to ensure fairness for farms in the same area with similar conditions. The Corporation provides lesser levels of yield coverage, including a 50 percent coverage option based on the average yield. Adjusted yields may be used for fairness among farms in the same area. The Corporation offers various levels of yield coverage, such as a 50 percent option based on average yield. Adjusted yields can be used for fairness among farms in the same area, allowing insurance coverage based on the adjusted yield established by the Service rather than the recorded or appraised yield by the Corporation. Loss in yield of the commodity is based on the adjusted yield established by the Service, not the recorded or appraised yield by the Corporation. Additional insurance premiums are set by the Board to accurately reflect increased risk and cover losses. The Board sets insurance premiums to accurately reflect increased risk and cover losses, with levels of coverage exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield available to producers in growing areas. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of average yield in growing areas if normal yield variations haven't led to loss claims, with a maximum coverage limit of 75 percent for producers. The Corporation limits coverage to 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. One price election must approximate the projected market price, set at a minimum of 90 percent. Insurance does not cover losses due to uninsured causes. The Board may limit or refuse insurance in any county or area, or on any farm, based on uninsured losses such as neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on uninsured losses such as neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. Insurance may not be provided on agricultural commodities in counties where the income from the commodity is deemed unimportant, except in certain circumstances. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on uninsured losses such as neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. Insurance may not be provided on agricultural commodities in counties where the income from the commodity is deemed unimportant, except in certain circumstances. The Corporation shall report annually to Congress the results of its operations for each insured commodity. Starting in 1992, the Corporation will establish a price level for project market prices. Starting in 1992, the Corporation will establish a price level for each commodity on which insurance is offered, not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available to producers based on the price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee of 1 percent per day. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee based on the number of days planting is delayed beyond the normal final planting date. Late planting coverage allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee based on the delay. Producers have this coverage unless they waive it, and premiums may increase if late planting coverage is included. Late planting coverage under this Act can be waived by producers to avoid premium increases. If including late planting coverage would significantly raise premiums, the Corporation will offer it as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if producers are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, providing them with 50 percent coverage. Producers on a farm can receive 50 percent coverage if they are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters. They also have the option to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, with the value of the substitute crop offsetting the remaining coverage for the insured crop. The basic policy of insurance under this Act allows for planting a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, with the value of the substitute crop offsetting the remaining coverage. Producers are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they waive it, and the Corporation may raise premiums if prevented planting coverage is included. Producers can waive prevented planting coverage, and if including it would raise premiums too much, the Corporation must offer it as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of their production is lower than harvesting costs. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for those covered. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for covered producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters, using transitional or actual yields data for the first 4 crop years. Transitional yield data can only be used to determine yield for producers on a farm if they have not established actual production history for the first 4 crop years. Once actual production history is established, yield coverage will be based solely on that history. For crop insurance purposes, producers on a farm can use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land if actual production history is not established. The Corporation adjusts Nonstandard Classification procedures to address yield declines from natural disasters. The Corporation adjusts Nonstandard Classification procedures in part 400 of chapter IV of subtitle B of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, to address producer yield declines due to recurrent natural disasters. The definition of transitional yield is the countywide average used by the Corporation when actual production records are unavailable for producers on a farm."
