    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to adoption. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, aiming to provide each child with a permanent home. This Act also incentivizes adoptions, leading to the placement of nearly 53,000 children from State care in fiscal year 2002. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 further emphasized moving older children into permanent homes. In 2003, the Adoption Promotion Act reauthorized the incentive program, focusing on moving older children into permanency. Despite increased adoptions, over 118,000 children in foster care are still waiting to be adopted, many with special needs requiring federal assistance for healing from past abuse and neglect.
