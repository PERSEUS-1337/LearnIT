    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries facing injury from subsidized imports by imposing additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Relief is granted if the International Trade Commission confirms material injury and the International Trade Administration finds the imports subsidized. The International Trade Commission must find domestic industry injury from imports, and the International Trade Administration must find subsidized imports. In a 2007 investigation on CFS paper from China, the ITA changed its stance on applying CVD laws to NME countries like China. The ITA changed its stance on applying CVD laws to NME countries like China in a 2007 investigation, determining that subsidies in China could be identified due to market principles in many industries. This decision was China-specific and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA's 2007 subsidy decision applied specifically to China as an NME country, based on criteria such as currency convertibility and wage rate determination through free bargaining. The ITA designates NME countries based on currency convertibility, wage rate determination, foreign investment, government control of production, and resource allocation. Current NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA designates NME countries based on various factors and has designated countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. In 1983-1984, the ITA decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in specific cases involving subsidization. The ITA designates NME countries based on various factors, including China, which is the United States' second largest trading partner. The U.S. trade deficit with China has led to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products. China, the United States' second largest trading partner, has a significant trade deficit with the U.S. Some in Congress support using trade remedy laws against Chinese products due to the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries. Concerns have been raised about China's alleged use of illegal subsidy programs to boost its industries and exports. U.S. domestic producers have long claimed to be adversely affected by China's subsidies, but the 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse on the issue. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse on the issue of China's subsidies, leading to concerns about the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place, and there are concerns about the undervaluation of China's currency affecting the competitiveness of Chinese exports. The undervaluation of China's currency is a concern for U.S. policymakers, affecting the competitiveness of Chinese exports and contributing to the U.S. trade deficit with China. This has led to challenges for U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. The undervaluation of China's currency has impacted U.S. production and employment in manufacturing sectors. Alleged Chinese currency manipulation has led to renewed congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The NME classification for China was determined by the ITA. The ITA determined China's NME classification in relation to currency misalignment issues. This determination was reaffirmed in investigations on certain products from China in 2006. The classification remains in effect until specifically revoked by U.S. law. The ITA's determination on China's NME classification in relation to currency misalignment issues was reaffirmed in 2006. This classification remains in effect until revoked by U.S. law, with a provision in China's WTO accession package limiting the NME designation's duration. The NME designation for China can only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package. After December 11, 2016, the US and other WTO members cannot use nonmarket economy methodology for price comparability in CVD or AD investigations. After December 11, 2016, the United States and other WTO members are no longer allowed to use nonmarket economy or \"surrogate country\" methodology in CVD or AD investigations. The duty on subsidized imports is determined by laws that require countervailing measures to address subsidization. The earlier law, repealed in 1995, was a modified version of a countervailing law from 1897 and applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement.\" The countervailing law, in effect from 1930 to January 1995, applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement,\" which included countries subject to the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code or with similar obligations to the US. It was repealed by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1995. Section 303 of the countervailing law, repealed in 1995, allowed for levying a countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidization without injury determination. The legislation had broader country applicability and included detailed procedural provisions. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added comprehensive provisions to the countervailing law, implementing international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations. This legislation required the assessment of countervailing duties without injury determination. The Subsidies and Countervailing Code, agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations in April 1979 under the GATT meeting in Geneva, required the assessment of countervailing duties based on the presence of subsidies and injury to US industries. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law by incorporating provisions similar to section 303, which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" The URAA amended the countervailing duty law to include provisions similar to section 303, which do not require injury determination in investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" Parallel investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated in 1983 based on petitions by U.S. steel manufacturers. Parallel countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated on December 13, 1983, following petitions filed with the ITA on November 23, 1983, by four U.S. steel manufacturers. The petitions alleged that public benefits were provided in both countries through a multiple exchange rate system and a partial hard-currency retention program for exporting firms. The countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland alleged public benefits through various exchange rate systems and programs for exporting firms. Both cases had similar issues with minor country-specific differences. The countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland found losses due to foreign sales below domestic prices. The determinations were identical with minor country-specific differences. The ITA considered both countries \"countries not under the Agreement\" and nonmarket economy (NME) countries. The ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures under Section 303 without the need to determine injury. They were also considered nonmarket economy countries, with unresolved questions regarding the application of countervailing duty laws to NME countries. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from countervailing duty laws, as per Section 303, based on statutory terms and legislative history. This issue arose in preliminary determinations in carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA determined that nonmarket economy countries are not automatically exempt from countervailing duty laws, based on Section 303. This decision was made during preliminary determinations in carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA, in its first opportunity to assess nonmarket economies, focused on prices as key elements of subsidization. In these economies, central planners set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices that do not reflect scarcity or abundance. In nonmarket economies, central planners set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices that do not reflect scarcity or abundance. Prices of scarce goods do not increase unless mandated by central planners, and internally set prices do not hold the same meaning as in a market economy. The ITA then analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy or a nonmarket economy. Preliminary conclusions were made regarding multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments, as well as the Polish adjustment coefficient program. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy or a nonmarket economy. It found that retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments did not constitute bounties or grants. The Polish adjustment coefficient program was also not considered a bounty or grant. The agency did not have enough information on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program to make a determination. As a result, the ITA concluded that the alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants within the meaning of the CVD law. The ITA found that alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants under the CVD law. Congress did not directly address the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA continued investigations into the final phase, focusing on this unresolved issue. The ITA concluded that Congress never directly addressed the application of the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries in the carbon steel wire rod cases. Congress did not debate or legislate on this issue in 1974 or 1979 when amendments were made to the CVD law. The ITA found that Congress did not address the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries in the carbon steel wire rod cases in 1974 or 1979 when amendments were made to the CVD law. Congress enacted remedial provisions specifically for injurious imports from State-controlled-economy or Communist countries, but not for countervailing action. The ITA pointed out that Congress recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries in the context of antidumping and market disruption actions, but not for countervailing action. Supply and demand forces do not operate in State-controlled-economy countries, leading to the ineffectiveness of traditional trade remedies. State-controlled-economy countries require special legislation for countervailing actions as traditional trade remedies are ineffective due to the lack of supply and demand forces. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of countervailing duty laws to non-market economy countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address countervailing duty laws for non-market economy countries, leaving a gap in regulations. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allows for regulation of unfairly priced imports from these countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. Identifying and quantifying subsidies in non-market economies is challenging according to U.S. government and academic sources. The ITA consulted various sources and found that identifying and quantifying subsidies in non-market economies is difficult. The countervailing duty law requires measuring state-to-producer resource transfers, which is not feasible in nonmarket economies. The countervailing duty law is challenging to apply in non-market economies as measuring state-to-producer resource transfers is not feasible. The ITA concluded that a \"bounty or grant\" cannot be found in a nonmarket economy, and identified Czechoslovakia and Poland as nonmarket economies due to their nonmarket cost or pricing structures. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland, identified as nonmarket economies, did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations in 1984. The ITA issued final negative countervailing duty determinations in 1984 for Czechoslovakia and Poland, who were identified as nonmarket economies and did not receive bounties or grants. Additionally, investigations were initiated for potassium chloride imports from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations in NME countries in 1984 due to the determination that bounties or grants cannot be found in NMEs. Since then, there have been no new countervailing investigations of allegedly subsidized imports from NME countries, except for one specialized exception in 1991. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China in 1991, based on a petition claiming that the PRC fan sector operates substantially pursuant to market principles. The petition for a countervailing duty investigation of Chinese fans claimed that the industry operates based on market principles and should be considered a market-oriented industry. The petitioners argued that the industry provides reliable self-provided data for determining fair market value. The petitioners in the Chinese fan CVD case claimed that the industry should be considered a market-oriented industry with dependable self-provided data for determining fair market value. The ITA's preliminary investigation found that some input prices were not market-determined, leading to doubts about the industry's status as an MOI. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the case. The ITA issued a final negative determination in the case as the PC fans industry is not considered an MOI. The U.S. Court of International Trade held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanding them to the ITA. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. It also set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The court addressed the grounds on which the ITA based its determination regarding the nonapplicability of countervailing procedures to countries with nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. It also set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT addressed the grounds on which the ITA based its determination regarding the nonapplicability of countervailing procedures to countries with nonmarket economies. The CIT, in its opinion, addressed the ITA's four grounds for determining nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. It also set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT addressed the grounds on which the ITA based its determination regarding the nonapplicability of countervailing procedures to countries with nonmarket economies. The CIT emphasized the need to interpret the CVD law based on its plain language, stating that subsidies can be found in nonmarket economies and that the law applies to any country without exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. It also set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT emphasized the need to interpret the CVD law based on its plain language, stating that subsidies can be found in nonmarket economies and that the law applies to any country without exemptions. Despite the ITA's attempt to exempt countries with nonmarket economies from countervailing procedures, the court found that the CVD law does not allow for per se exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade redefined the term \"subsidy\" as a distortion of a market economy, amending the CVD law. It criticized the ITA for exempting countries with nonmarket economies, stating that subsidies can exist in such countries. The court emphasized the need to interpret the CVD law based on its plain language and highlighted the ITA's authority to detect patterns of regularity and investigate deviations. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for exempting nonmarket economies from the CVD law, stating that subsidies can exist in such countries. The court emphasized the ITA's authority to detect patterns of regularity and investigate deviations, regardless of the form of the economy. Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries was noted, with the CIT pointing out that other remedial measures like antidumping laws are for different trade problems. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for exempting nonmarket economies from the CVD law, stating that subsidies can exist in such countries. The court emphasized the ITA's authority to detect patterns of regularity and investigate deviations, regardless of the form of the economy. Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries was noted, with the CIT pointing out that other remedial measures like antidumping laws are for different trade problems. The CIT also highlighted that Article 15 of the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law and antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies.

The CIT also highlighted that Article 15 of the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law and antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The court summarily dismissed the ITA's recourse to the views of \"economic academia\" that a nonmarket economy cannot show favoritism towards particular merchandise, stating it conflicts with a rational construction of the law. The ITA's alleged assertion of broad discretion in determining subsidies was not specifically addressed but implicitly challenged in the critique of administrative actions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws in the potash cases, concluding that the CVD statute under which the investigations were conducted was challenged for administrative actions contrary to law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws in the potash cases, focusing on the CVD statute under which the investigations were conducted. The court concluded that the statute had remained substantially unchanged since its enactment in 1897 and that Congress had not defined key terms, leading to uncertainty regarding its application to nonmarket economies. The appellate court could not determine if the CVD statute applies to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms by Congress. Congress had not excluded nonmarket economies when enacting the law in 1897. The appellate court had to determine if the countervailing duty law applied to nonmarket economies, as Congress had not addressed this issue when enacting the law in 1897. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for their potash exports did not constitute bounties or grants under the law. The court concluded that economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for their potash exports to the United States did not constitute bounties or grants under the countervailing duty law. The Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order that reversed the ITA's final CVD determinations in wire rod cases and remanded them for lack of jurisdiction. It also reversed the CIT order that set aside the ITA's final actions in the potash cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the CIT orders on wire rod and potash cases, triggering a reaction in Congress with the introduction of H.R. 3 in 1987 to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The Trade and International Economic Policy Reform Act of 1987, introduced in the 100th Congress, aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The House version included detailed procedural provisions, but the Senate version did not include a similar provision. The Trade and International Economic Policy Reform Act of 1987 aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The House version included procedural provisions, but the Senate version did not include a similar provision. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries was addressed. In 1987, efforts were made to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries, but were not further considered. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries was addressed. In the 103rd Congress, the Trade Enforcement Act of 1993 expanded the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to NME countries and prescribed the use of a surrogate market-economy country method for determining its amount. The countervailing duty law was expanded to nonmarket economy (NME) countries by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465), using a surrogate market-economy country method for determining the amount. Identical bills were introduced in subsequent Congresses to apply the law to NME countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment date. In subsequent Congresses, bills were introduced to expand the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment date. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries. This was included in broader trade-remedial legislation introduced in July 2005. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries. This was included in broader trade-remedial legislation introduced in July 2005, focusing on trade with China and subjecting all NME countries to countervailing action. The Chinese Currency Act of 2005 aimed to apply countervailing duty law to NME countries, specifically triggered by alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to address exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailing duty law, including H.R. 1498, S. 364, H.R. 571, H.R. 708, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, H.R. 1229, and S. 974. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailing duty law, including H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, and related bill S. 796. In the 111th Congress, bills H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 sought to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies. H.R. 499, the \"Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2009\", introduced on January 14, 2009, aims to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. Both bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings. This would end the practice of assigning individual rates to companies in NME countries that show independence from government control. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from assigning individual rates to companies in NME countries that demonstrate independence from government control. China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies may be used if difficulties arise in identifying subsidy amounts. China may be designated as a nonmarket economy country, and authorities would use methodologies to calculate benefits considering that terms in China may not be applicable as benchmarks. If China is deemed an NME country, authorities are directed to presume special difficulties in determining subsidies. If China is designated as a nonmarket economy country, authorities must use terms and conditions prevailing outside of China to calculate subsidies. NME status can only be revoked with approval from a joint resolution of Congress. The bills aim to amend current law regarding the calculation of subsidies for nonmarket economy countries like China. They propose that NME status can only be revoked with approval from a joint resolution of Congress, providing specific language and time limits for debate. The Bush Administration took steps to address concerns about China's alleged export subsidies, including initiating a CVD investigation on a Chinese product. The Bush Administration addressed concerns about China's alleged export subsidies by initiating a CVD investigation on a Chinese product and consulting with the WTO on China's subsidy regime. The ITA announced a CVD investigation on CFS paper from China, with the ITC preliminarily determining that a U.S. domestic industry is threatened by material injury. The International Trade Commission (ITC) preliminarily determined on December 15, 2006, that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured or threatened by allegedly subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA also announced an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on March 30, 2007. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on March 30, 2007. Preliminary estimates of net countervailable subsidy rates ranged from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination in mid-October found that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with final subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. The ITA found that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with final subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as a non-market economy, the ITA acknowledged that China's present-day economy is significantly different from Soviet-style economies. The ITA found countervailable subsidies for CFS paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's NME status, the agency noted significant differences in China's present-day economy compared to Soviet-style economies. Market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China. The ITA found countervailable subsidies for CFS paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China, with wages negotiated and private ownership rights acknowledged by the Chinese government. The PRC government has shrunk the state's role in some areas while preserving it in others, never completely ceding control over the economy to market forces. The ITA found countervailable subsidies for CFS paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite being an NME country, China's economy allows the agency to determine if benefits were given by the government to Chinese producers. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper on December 7, 2007. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper from China and Indonesia. Factors considered include production capacity, potential for product shifting, price effects, inventories, and impact on domestic industry development. Based on the ITC's negative determination of injury in countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper from China and Indonesia, it was found that material injury by reason of subject imports will not occur. The domestic CFSP industry is not threatened with material injury from imports from China and Indonesia, as the investigation was terminated and all estimated duties deposited or bonds posted. The domestic CFSP industry is not threatened with material injury by imports from China and Indonesia. The ITC issued a final negative CVD determination, leading to the termination of the investigation and refunding of duties. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, although no CV duties were ultimately imposed. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, leading to countervailing duties being imposed on 13 products. China filed a lawsuit to prevent further CVD investigations. On January 9, 2007, China filed a lawsuit to prevent the ITA from continuing CVD investigations, citing a court ruling that questioned the application of CVD law to NME countries. The Court later ruled it lacked jurisdiction due to no final determination being made, leaving the legality of applying CVD law to NMEs unclear. The Court did not rule on whether the ITA has the legal authority to apply countervailing duty law to NMEs, stating that \"it is not clear that Commerce is prohibited from applying countervailing duty law to NMEs.\" China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on its preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. No further action has been taken in the dispute. China has been active in using antidumping investigations against products from the United States and other countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States over alleged illegal subsidies. This marks the first step in the dispute resolution process. China has been actively using antidumping investigations against products from the United States and other countries. The USTR announced that the United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs in response to the request. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, including tax laws and measures providing tax refunds or exemptions to Chinese businesses. These subsidies were said to distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs across various industries. The USTR stated that China's subsidies can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs in multiple industries, inhibiting U.S. exports to China and giving China an unfair advantage. China agreed to terminate all alleged illegal subsidies by January 1, 2008, signing MOUs with the United States and Mexico for their elimination. On November 29, 2007, USTR Schwab announced that China agreed to end all subsidies deemed illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate these subsidies. The USTR confirmed in the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report that China had followed through on its promise. In December 2009, a settlement agreement was reached between the United States and China regarding export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's confirmation of subsidies in China, some in Congress planned to address unfair trade practices affecting American workers, farmers, and businesses. Congress may consider addressing unfair trade practices affecting American workers, farmers, and businesses, despite the ITA's confirmation of subsidies in China. The ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China does not impact China's nonmarket economy status or NME designations of other countries. Additionally, it does not change the ITA's inability to find subsidies in NME countries other than China. The ITA's decision to identify subsidies in China does not affect China's nonmarket economy status or NME designations of other countries. Congress may need to consider legislation to apply CVD laws to other NME countries like Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries is currently not significant. The trade with other nonmarket economy (NME) countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan is not significant currently. There are no outstanding trade disputes or antidumping orders with these countries. Additionally, there are no specific methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for identifying subsidies in NME countries. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy countries, allowing the use of third-country data. Countervailing duties tend to be lower than antidumping duties, with duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries being even higher. Making CVD procedures available to U.S. industries has trade-offs, with AD duties typically higher than countervailing duties. AD duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries are even higher due to the third-country data methodology. If China keeps its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise with existing AD duties, some duties may need adjustment to avoid double counting. The GAO highlighted these concerns in a June 2005 report. In June 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns about the potential for double counting in anti-dumping (AD) duties on Chinese products. If the International Trade Administration (ITA) targets subsidies in China, there could be unintended consequences leading to a reduction in overall protection provided. The International Trade Administration (ITA) targeting subsidies in China could lead to unintended consequences, potentially reducing overall protection. However, different remedies for price manipulation may allow some U.S. industries to obtain relief through Countervailing Duty (CVD) procedures."
