    "content": "Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is interested in how states are monitoring and regulating the use of these medications for foster children. Prescription of psychotropic medication for foster children may be appropriate due to their mental health needs, but evidence on safety and efficacy is limited. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of these medications for children in foster care. Federal law requires states to oversee prescription drug use, including psychotropic medications, for children in foster care. The report discusses the mental health needs of children in foster care and the use of psychotropic medications. It also covers congressional oversight and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assist states in ensuring appropriate medication use. State monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children is briefly mentioned. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of child abuse or neglect by parents or guardians, leading to some children being placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. This decision is made by a judge when the child's home is deemed harmful to their welfare. Foster care is a round-the-clock care system provided by the state child welfare agency for children removed from harmful homes due to neglect or abuse. It is meant to be a temporary solution until a permanent placement is found. Children may enter foster care due to neglect or abuse by parents, with behavior problems also playing a role, especially for older children. Foster care is a temporary solution until reunification with parents or permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or legal guardian. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children in foster care, addressing their physical and mental health needs. In FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system, leaving nearly 428,000 children in care. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care on the last day of FY2015 compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs that must be addressed. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care on the last day of FY2015 compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, impacting their socialization and emotional regulation. Maltreatment by caregivers can impact children's brain development, leading to difficulties in regulating emotions and interpreting social cues. This can result in behavioral and emotional problems, with a significant percentage of children in foster care needing mental health services. Children placed in foster care following abuse or neglect investigations are at high risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with 43%-46% in family homes and 61%-70% in group homes/institutions needing mental health services. This is much higher than the general population where 7%-11% of children have such issues. Medicaid-eligible children in foster care have been a focus in recent years. Children in foster care, especially those with Medicaid eligibility, are increasingly diagnosed with mental health issues such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Nearly all foster care children are eligible for Medicaid-funded health care services. Children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility are being diagnosed with mental health disorders such as autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. The prevalence of these diagnoses increased from 2002 to 2007, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. In 2007, children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility were diagnosed with various mental health disorders. The most common diagnoses varied by age, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. Children ages 3 to 5 had conduct disorder (7.4%) and attention disorders (6.7%); ages 6 to 11 had attention disorders (52.5%) and conduct disorders (26.8%); ages 12 to 18 had conduct disorders (67.3%) and depression (44.4%). In 2007, children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility were diagnosed with various mental health disorders. Children ages 12 to 18 were most likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders (67.3%) and depression (44.4%). Rates of major mental health diagnoses increased for both age groups, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia among both age groups. National standards recommend mental health screening for all children. National standards recommend mental health screening for all children in foster care, with subsequent comprehensive assessments within a month. Medicaid provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care. Medicaid offers diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, ensuring a coordinated approach to meet their ongoing mental health needs. Each state designs its own plan for medical assistance under Medicaid, which must comply with federal requirements and allows for federal reimbursement. Most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and receive the same set of services. The Medicaid program provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, ensuring they receive necessary health screenings and services through the EPSDT program. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and entitled to the same services as other children in the state's Medicaid program. The EPSDT program ensures children in foster care receive all necessary health screenings and services, including assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services at regular intervals. States must provide treatment for children's identified health needs, including mental health, using Medicaid financing. Under EPSDT, states must provide screenings and services at regular intervals to meet children's health needs, including mental health. This may include services from psychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers, as well as prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Certain psychosocial treatment interventions have been found to be moderately effective for children with antisocial-related and disruptive behaviors. Interventions like CBT, family-focused treatment, and group therapy have shown moderate effectiveness for children with antisocial behaviors. CBT, including anger management and social skills training, is effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Children in foster care who experience trauma may be prescribed psychotropic medications when psychosocial treatment alone is ineffective. This can occur due to a lack of resources and support for addressing their complex mental health needs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted that an over-reliance on medication for children in care may indicate a lack of access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to children with mental health needs in general. Medicaid enrollees in some states have limited access to evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration rates treatments based on their effectiveness. Children entering foster care receive more mental health supports compared to those with mental health needs who remain at home. Research on Medicaid claims data shows an increase in psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children taking antipsychotic medication, compared to non-foster children. Children in foster care with \"care\" status eligible for Medicaid showed increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions while taking antipsychotic medication, compared to non-foster children in Medicaid. Studies indicate that children in foster care needing mental health services may not always receive them, with 3 out of 10 not receiving specialty mental health services despite meeting clinical criteria. Between 2008 and 2010, a study found that 3 out of 10 children in foster care for 18 months or less with mental health needs did not receive specialty mental health services, and 9% received psychotropics without services. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care vary based on factors like age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency, with between 16% and 33% using medication on any given day. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care far exceed the rates among children generally, with between 16% and 33% using medication on any given day. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at three to nine times the rate of all other children served by Medicaid, comparable to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Children in non-relative foster family homes are prescribed psychotropic medication at a rate comparable to older children with mental disorders, but higher than other children served by Medicaid. Research shows no significant difference in medication prescription between children in non-relative foster homes and those living in their own homes. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children involved with the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research from the early 2000s found great variation in prescription of psychotropic medication for these children. Differences in risk for mental health services across states were attributed to these variations. In the early 2000s, research showed significant variation in psychotropic medication prescription for children in foster care within the child welfare system. State practices, rather than differences in mental health service risk, were found to be the primary factor influencing this variation. Another study analyzing Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 also revealed varying levels of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with initial increases followed by some decline in most states. Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. There was an initial increase followed by some decline in most states, but an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications specifically. 45 states saw a relative increase in the use of these medications during this time period. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state, with increases in the use of antipsychotics from 2005 to 2008. A recent review analyzed trends in Medicaid claims data for children in foster care and found that antipsychotic use increased from 2005 to 2008, then slightly decreased by 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 to 2009. The use of antipsychotics among privately insured children increased from 2005 to 2009, remaining steady through 2013 at 0.75%. Data from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) was used to examine psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. NSCAW II, funded by HHS, studied outcomes of 5,872 children in contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect. It looked at psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and those who remained in their homes after the investigation. The NSCAW II study examined outcomes of children in contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect, including those who stayed with their parents or in foster care. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up points. At the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups, children's ages ranged from 16 months to 20 years. Children in the sample may have entered and re-entered foster care during this period. NSCAW II data shows that children living with their own parents after an investigation were less likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. The NSCAW II data indicates that children living with their own parents after an investigation of child abuse or neglect were less likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. Living in congregate care and being school age were factors associated with a higher likelihood of a child in foster care using psychotropic medications. There was no significant difference in medication use between children placed in foster care and those who remained in their homes at four to six months following the investigation. At 18 months post-investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained at home. By the 36-month follow-up, one-third of children in care were on psychotropics, compared to 12.9% of children at home. At the 36-month follow-up, one-third of children in foster care were taking psychotropic medications, compared to 12.9% of children at home. Among children in foster care, those in group homes or residential programs had higher medication use than those in foster family homes or kin care. Among children in group foster care settings, close to half (48.2%) were prescribed psychotropic medications within six months of initial investigation, compared to 11.8% to 19.5% in other foster care settings. After approximately 18 months, children in group settings still had the highest prescription rate (67.4%), while less than a quarter of children in other foster care settings were prescribed psychotropics (15.9% to 23.8%). After 36 months, children in group foster care settings continued to have the highest rate of psychotropic medication prescription at 52%, compared to 16.5% to 36.1% in other foster care settings, 12.5% for children in their own homes, and 16.5% for those in informal kin care. Just over half of children in group foster care settings were taking psychotropic medications (52%), with higher rates compared to other foster care settings, children in their own homes, and those in informal kin care. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication. At 18 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking multiple psychotropic medications, with about half of them taking two or more drugs. The rate of children in other child welfare settings taking multiple drugs was lower, ranging from 5.7% to 14.6%. At 36 months following the initial investigation, about 4 out of 10 children in group settings were taking two or more psychotropic medications, followed by children in foster care and formal kin care. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be taking two or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medication if they were of elementary and secondary school age. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medication at 36 months following the investigation, with youth ages 11 to 17 being the most likely to be using psychotropics. Older youth, ages 18 and older, were not as likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 through 17. The research found that children in foster care, particularly those aged 6 to 10 and 1.5 to 5 years, were more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. However, older youth aged 18 and above were less likely to be taking these medications. The prescribing patterns for foster children have been described as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" with polypharmacy rates remaining consistent at around 5.2% to 5.9% annually from 2002 to 2007. A study of national Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 found that polypharmacy rates among children in foster care remained consistent at 5.2% to 5.9% annually. In 2011, polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs was comparable for foster care (2.8%) and non-foster care (3.1%) children. In 2011, polypharmacy rates with three or more antipsychotic drugs were comparable for children in foster care (2.8%) and non-foster care (3.1%). Data from the NSCAW II study showed that children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child. The percentage of children in group or residential settings prescribed three or more psychotropics was significantly higher compared to other groups. The difference in the prescription of three or more psychotropic medications for children in group or residential settings is statistically significant. Concerns have been raised about using multiple antipsychotic medications concurrently, as it can lead to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Dosages exceeding recommendations for foster children are particularly concerning due to safety issues. The use of multiple psychotropic medications for children in group or residential settings has raised concerns due to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Prescriptions exceeding recommendations for foster children, especially very young ones, are worrisome as studies on the safety and efficacy of these medications for children are limited. The NSCAW II study found that 2.2% of children under 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropics. The NSCAW II study found that 2.2% of children under 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropics, with rates varying among different types of care settings. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined Medicaid data from 2008 and found varying prescription rates for psychotropic drugs among foster children in different states, with higher rates compared to infants not in foster care. Research also showed an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with age among children in foster care. Research has shown higher rates of psychotropic drug prescriptions among children in foster care compared to those not in foster care, with rates increasing with age. Concerns have been raised about the lack of established mental health indications for psychotropic drug use in infants and young children, as it can lead to serious health effects. Despite greater mental health service needs, the use of psychotropic medications in children in foster care may not always be beneficial. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medications due to their greater mental health service needs. However, these medications may not always be effective in treating their mental health needs. The lack of psychosocial services available for children in care could be a contributing factor, as there is a shortage of mental health providers with clinical understanding of the complex trauma many of these children may have experienced. The lack of services for children in foster care may be due to a shortage of mental health providers with clinical understanding of their trauma. The use of antipsychotic medications for children in foster care has increased, despite a decrease in overall prescribing rates. The use of antipsychotic medication for children in foster care has steadily increased, possibly influenced by limited research on efficacy and pharmaceutical marketing. Additionally, there has been a rise in the prescription of psychotropic medications for children in recent years. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders. Limited research on the efficacy of these medications in children, along with the influence of pharmaceutical marketing, has led to increased prescription rates. Despite an expanding body of research, few studies demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of psychotropics for this population, particularly antipsychotics. Few studies show the safety and effectiveness of psychotropic use in children with mental health disorders. Research on antipsychotics found insufficient evidence for their safety in addressing child mental health disorders, including conditions like disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. The median study duration of eight weeks was deemed insufficient for evaluating long-term effects. The analysis found little evidence for certain conditions like disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and eating disorders. The median study duration of eight weeks was inadequate for assessing long-term outcomes. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to mishandling of missing data, non-random assignment of participants, and funding from pharmaceutical companies. Antipsychotics have been linked to harmful health outcomes in some children. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma, despite potential harmful health outcomes. Stimulants are also used for treating ADHD in children. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms of mental health and behavior concerns related to complex trauma. Stimulants, particularly for ADHD, have shown effectiveness in reducing core symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Trials have shown that stimulants effectively reduce core symptoms of ADHD in children, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health diagnoses compared to the general population, with increased psychotropic drug use deemed appropriate due to the severity of their conditions. Multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices may contribute to these challenges. Higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate for children in foster care due to the increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medications for these children, including holding hearings on their enrollment in clinical drug trials. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing to examine the enrollment of children in foster care in clinical drug trials, following media reports on the use of foster children in clinical AIDS drug trials. Congress later required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals in assessing the health of children in foster care as part of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. In 2006, the Child and Family Services Improvement Act (P.L. 109-288) mandated state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for assessing and treating foster children's health. Congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008 focused on oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. In 2007 and 2008, congressional hearings discussed oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to ensure the health and well-being of children in foster care. The 2008 law expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to ensure the health and well-being of children in foster care, including oversight of prescribed drugs. The 2011 amendment further specified the need for protocols on the use of psychotropic medication. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amended provisions for oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care, emphasizing the need for protocols on the use of psychotropic medication. In December of that year, the Senate held an oversight hearing on state policies and regulations for prescribing psychotropic medications. The oversight hearing by Federal Services and International Security focused on the results and recommendations of a study by the Government Accountability Office. GAO reviewed state policies for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications in six states, finding that each program fell short of comprehensive oversight as defined by AACAP. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed best practice guidelines for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications. A study by the Government Accountability Office found that six state programs did not fully implement these guidelines, leading to potential lack of awareness of risks and benefits for caregivers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that states not following AACAP's consent procedures may lead to caregivers being unaware of risks and benefits of psychotropic medications. GAO recommended HHS endorse guidance for monitoring these medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed improving cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the role of HHS and state Medicaid programs in improving cooperation and communication for children in foster care. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications prescribed while in foster care. He highlighted the importance of a therapist he saw with his adoptive parents. Former foster youth described receiving multiple mental health diagnoses and experiencing side effects from psychotropic medications prescribed while in foster care. He found a therapist he saw with his adoptive parents to be most helpful. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion with child welfare stakeholders to address issues related to psychotropic medication use in foster care and explore alternative trauma response strategies. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences at the roundtable. The roundtable discussion addressed issues with psychotropic medication use for children in foster care and emphasized alternative trauma response strategies. Former foster youth shared their experiences, noting the importance of therapy in transitioning from medication. Stakeholders discussed the prevalence of medication use among youth subpopulations. The importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment was highlighted. Child welfare stakeholders discussed psychotropic medication use among youth, federal government promotion of alternatives, tools for medication prescription, and the roles of schools, mental health system, and foster parents. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. Staff from GAO discussed their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication use. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO's work from 2011 to 2014 focused on psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. The GAO contracted child psychiatrists to examine documentation supporting psychotropic use among children in foster care. Varying quality was found, with some cases having partial support for medication dosage and concurrent use of multiple medications. The GAO found varying quality of documentation supporting pediatric exams, with partial support for medication dosage and concurrent use of multiple medications. They recommended HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication by third-party managed care organizations for children in foster care. The GAO found varying quality of documentation supporting pediatric exams and medication dosage for children in foster care. HHS issued guidance to state agencies on oversight of psychotropic medication use, but did not address the role of third-party MCOs. State officials developed practices to monitor psychotropic use among foster children. In 2017, child welfare and Medicaid agencies in seven states developed practices to monitor psychotropic use among children in foster care, including guidelines on prescribing medications and promoting psychosocial services. Officials reported implementing initial mental health screenings and monitoring children after medication is prescribed. In 2017, child welfare and Medicaid agencies in seven states developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services. Strong collaboration among agencies and gradual rollout of new practices were critical in implementing oversight work. GAO did not assess the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. State officials reported using various measures to gauge the results of their oversight efforts, including physician prescribing practices, state oversight practices, and monitoring child outcomes. GAO also examined how HHS supported states in their oversight work. The GAO recommended that HHS consider cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight for children in care. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children, including those in foster care. Federal agencies have collaborated to understand and promote best practices for oversight of psychotropic medication use for children. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children, including those in foster care, as part of its annual budgets. This was done to promote interagency cooperation and develop alternative strategies for children with mental health needs. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children, including those in foster care, as part of its annual budgets. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for all children in foster care. This plan must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, in consultation with health care experts. The coordinated strategy and oversight plan must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, in consultation with health care experts, to ensure access to health care for children in foster care. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, and appropriate sharing of medical information. The standards of medical practice for children in foster care include monitoring and treating health needs identified through screenings, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, and consulting with physicians. This is part of a coordinated strategy developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency to ensure access to health care for children in foster care. The state ensures oversight of prescription medicines, consults with medical professionals for appropriate treatment, and develops transition plans for children aging out of foster care. Federal law mandates a written plan for each child in foster care. The state oversees prescription medicines, consults medical professionals for treatment, and develops transition plans for children aging out of foster care. Federal law requires a written plan for each child in foster care, including health-related records like immunizations, medication, and provider information. These records must be updated and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement. The state oversees prescription medicines, consults medical professionals for treatment, and develops transition plans for children aging out of foster care. Health-related records, including medication information, must be reviewed, updated, and supplied to foster care parents or providers at each placement. States report to HHS on their policies regarding oversight of psychotropic medications through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. The Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) and Annual Progress and Services Reports (APSRs) are required annually for jurisdictions seeking federal funds for child welfare programs. The APSR instructions mandate state oversight protocols to address screening, evaluation, and consent for psychotropic medications. The 2011 law (the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, P.L. 112-34) mandated state oversight protocols for screening, evaluation, consent for psychotropic medications, medication monitoring, mental health expertise availability, and information sharing. Subsequent program instructions have been less detailed. The most recent CFSP covers FY2015-FY2019 and includes reporting on oversight of prescription medicines. The 2011 law mandated state oversight protocols for psychotropic medications in foster care. The most recent CFSP covers FY2015-FY2019 and includes reporting on prescription medicines. HHS convened a working group to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The working group led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, and interventions for children in foster care. It also focuses on strengthening oversight of psychotropic medications and expanding research on medications and psychosocial treatments. The group includes representatives from HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) leads a working group that includes representatives from HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA. CMS administers Medicaid for financing screenings, assessments, therapy, and prescription drugs for eligible children. SAMHSA administers block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services and provides technical assistance for understanding trauma. SAMHSA administers block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services and supports projects related to understanding trauma in children. A letter released by ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS addressed effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care. The letter addressed actions taken by federal agencies to support effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care, emphasizing collaboration between state child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies. The letter discussed collaboration between state child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities to improve health and medication monitoring for children in foster care. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda to raise awareness about psychotropic use among children in out-of-home care. In 2012, HHS agencies provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda to help states and stakeholders monitor psychotropic medication use in foster care. They also organized question and answer sessions for state child welfare and mental health leaders to enhance oversight and monitoring. In 2012, HHS agencies organized question and answer sessions for state child welfare and mental health leaders to enhance oversight and monitoring. In August 2012, state directors of child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies convened to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and the mental health needs of children who have experienced trauma. The summit aimed to improve collaboration on the appropriate use of psychotropic medications. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit aimed to enhance collaboration among state leaders on the oversight of psychotropic medications. States were tasked with identifying areas for improvement, outlining activities to meet goals, and addressing anticipated challenges. Presentations from HHS staff and researchers provided insights on psychotropic oversight. Since the summit, HHS has continued its work on oversight of psychotropic medications. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication, synthesizing information based on guidelines from child welfare and medical professionals. This addresses coordinated planning and informed decision-making. HHS and ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication, including elements such as coordinated planning, informed decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements in their monitoring of psychotropic drug use for children in foster care. ACF issued guidance to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development's impact on social and emotional development. ACF also published guides for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications during physician visits. ACF has published guides for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications during physician visits and awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs, including providing assistance using evidence-based intervention models. SAMHSA also provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. SAMHSA partially funded AACAP to develop guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. The guidelines focus on clinical practice, medication monitoring, and research. SAMHSA also funds a medical director position at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work to work with child and adolescent psychiatrists in state and county governments on psychotropic medication issues. The network disseminates best practices through a community listerv. The medical director at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work collaborates with child and adolescent psychiatrists in state and county governments to address psychotropic medication issues. They use a community listerv to share best practices and offer webinars on medication oversight, particularly for children on Medicaid. A CMS bulletin in August 2012 highlighted resources for states to monitor the use of psychotropic medications in vulnerable populations, such as children in foster care. In August 2012, a CMS bulletin informed states about resources to monitor psychotropic medication use in vulnerable populations, like children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs to oversee Medicaid drug prescriptions, with examples of oversight methods provided. Some states use automated system checks to ensure prescriptions align with medical guidelines. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children receiving Medicaid. This included adding a measure to core measures that states can voluntarily use to enhance healthcare delivery. CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA collaborated to promote psychosocial interventions for children who have experienced \"complex trauma\". CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued joint guidance in July 2013 to emphasize the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma\". The guidance highlighted the use of existing federal funding to support these interventions for children in foster care. The guidance in July 2013 emphasized using federal funding for psychosocial interventions for children in foster care, promoting functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome monitoring. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. The FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Incentive payments would be provided to state Medicaid agencies for improved care coordination and delivery of evidence-based interventions. States could apply for the incentive funding totaling $500 million over five years. The FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Incentive payments would be provided to state Medicaid agencies for improved care coordination and delivery of evidence-based interventions. States could also apply for competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to build state capacity for alternative psychosocial interventions. ACF would support child welfare funding for implementing evidence-based psychosocial interventions for children in care. ACF would support child welfare funding for building state capacity to implement evidence-based psychosocial interventions for children in care, including ensuring fidelity to these models and evaluating the work. Research has focused on states overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care, addressing issues like obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to understand states' policies in this area. Researchers have conducted surveys of states to learn about their policies related to the oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Some surveys were done before the specific requirement for oversight of prescription medications, while others were done after. However, none of these surveys address how states have responded to the federal provision added to the law in September 2011 on oversight of psychotropic medications specifically. In 2009 and 2010, researchers surveyed states to learn about policies for overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care. Over half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. Researchers surveyed 48 states, finding that over half rated psychotropic medication use as a high concern. 26 states had a policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had no policy. More than half used a \"red flag\" marker to identify issues with medication safety. States were implementing a wide variety of red flags to identify problems with the safety and quality of psychotropic drug use, including the use of medications in young children, multiple medications before a single one, simultaneous use of multiple psychotropic medications, prolonged use of multiple medications within the same class, and exceeding recommended dosages. Researchers found that states were using various methods to identify issues with psychotropic medication use in children in foster care, such as using multiple medications before trying a single one, using multiple medications at the same time, prolonged use of medications within the same class, and exceeding recommended dosages. However, there was little evidence that these approaches were being systematically implemented or studied to determine their effectiveness in improving outcomes for these children. Researchers also expressed concerns about the lack of policies and procedures addressing psychotropic medication use. Researchers have raised concerns about the lack of policies and procedures for oversight of psychotropic medication use in children in foster care. A 2014 study found that existing policies were underdeveloped and did not include essential criteria for protecting children. Many state policies on oversight of psychotropic medication use in foster care were found to be underdeveloped and lacking key criteria. However, states are making efforts to address this issue through collaborative working groups and summits. States are working collaboratively to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The Center for Health Care Strategies partnered with six states from 2012 to 2015 in the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative to define common terms and measures for data collection. The Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative involved state agencies working together to define common terms and measures for data on psychotropic medication use among foster youth. They developed best practices for oversight and monitoring, with states implementing protocols in four key areas. The states have implemented protocols in four areas for oversight of psychotropic medications with support from SAMSHA. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children in contact with the child welfare agency. Appendix A. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II analyzed psychotropic medication use among children (5,873) involved with the child welfare agency due to abuse or neglect. Data collected in 2008-2009 showed medication use in children aged 18 months to 17 years. A follow-up survey examined medication use in the same children at around 18. The data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II analyzed psychotropic medication use among children involved with the child welfare agency due to abuse or neglect. A follow-up survey looked at medication use in the same children at approximately 18 and 36 months after the initial investigation. Table A-1 shows medication use by age and foster care status. Table A-1 displays psychotropic medication usage categorized by age and foster care status for children involved with the child welfare agency due to abuse or neglect. Foster care settings include non-relative foster homes, kin placements, and group/residential settings, while the \"in home\" category comprises children living with biological/adoptive parents or in informal kinship care. The analysis also considers statistical significance in percentage differences. The initial survey did not show statistically significant differences in psychotropic medication usage between children in foster care and those not in foster care. However, at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, children in foster care were found to be more likely to use psychotropic medications. At the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medications, with statistically significant differences shown for different age groups. No statistical significance was found for children under age 6, while children ages 6 to 10 showed significant differences at the 18-month follow-up. For children ages 6 to 10, statistically significant differences were found between in-home and foster care groups at the 18-month follow-up, but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. Children ages 11 through 17 showed significant differences at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, but not at the initial survey."
