    "title": "AB 2514",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is set at 5% of property tax for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is determined based on the property tax distributed in the previous fiscal year, with a minimum of $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The annual administrative costs of a successor agency cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year, regardless of payment source. The oversight board approves the administrative cost allowance as the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. The \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under Section 34173. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes specific criteria outlined in the legislation. An \"enforceable obligation\" refers to bonds issued by a former redevelopment agency, including debt service, reserve set-asides, and other required payments under the bond indenture. A reserve may be held if property tax allocation is insufficient for upcoming bond payments. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for lawful purposes must be repaid according to a set schedule or mandatory terms. Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base, pass with a state water contractor. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds, excluding passthrough payments and legally required payments for agency employees such as pension payments, debt service, and unemployment payments. These employee obligations will remain enforceable and payable from property tax funds. The obligations to city employees who worked for the former redevelopment agency are enforceable and payable from property tax funds. If these employees are transferred to the entity taking over the housing functions, the obligations remain enforceable. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or set aside settlements against the former redevelopment agency. Any legally binding agreement or contract not void due to debt limit or public policy can be terminated by the successor agency or oversight board with compensation. Titles or headings in a document do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must comply with specified sections. Legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts shall only be incurred after January 1, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, legal expenses for civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts must be paid from the administrative cost allowance. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided by the sponsoring entity for successful causes of action shall be repaid under specified terms. The sponsoring entity will be repaid for legal expenses if the successor agency wins a case, as an enforceable obligation. If the relief requested is not granted, the funds provided will be considered a grant and not eligible for repayment. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency will be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes, subject to oversight board approval. The enforceable obligations for a redevelopment agency do not include agreements between the city and the former agency, except for written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding or refinancing of other debts by June 27, 2011. Written agreements entered into at the time of issuance, but no later than June 27, 2011, for the refunding or refinancing of pre-2011 indebtedness obligations may be considered enforceable obligations. Loan agreements between a redevelopment agency and the creating city, county, or city and county within two years of the agency's creation may also be deemed enforceable obligations. Loan agreements between a redevelopment agency and the creating city, county, or city and county within two years of the agency's creation may be deemed enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements committed prior to June 28, 2011, are considered enforceable obligations. The agreement between the city, county, or city and county and the former redevelopment agency is considered an enforceable obligation if it requires repayment or fulfillment of outstanding loans or development obligations imposed by a federal agency. The former redevelopment agency must repay loans or fulfill obligations imposed by a federal agency like the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that were not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts. The curr_chunk defines \"Indebtedness obligations\" as bonds or other debt issued by the redevelopment agency, \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179, and \"Recognized obligation\" as obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The curr_chunk further defines \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179 and \"Recognized obligation\" as obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule, which outlines minimum payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations. The curr_chunk defines \"School entity\" as entities defined in the Revenue and Taxation Code, \"Successor agency\" as the entity succeeding the former redevelopment agency, \"Taxing entities\" as entities receiving passthrough payments, and \"Property taxes\" as all property tax revenues. The curr_chunk further defines \"Department\" as the Department of Finance, \"Sponsoring entity\" as the entity authorizing the redevelopment agency, and \"Final judicial determination\" as a conclusive court decision. From July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" is defined as up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year, based on a final judicial determination. The housing entity administrative cost allowance, defined as up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year, is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future payment schedules without a time limit."
