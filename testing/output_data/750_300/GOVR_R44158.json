    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure and support programs. The application of irrigation technologies has led to changes in the industry, but comes with costs such as infrastructure and support programs. These costs can impact water users and the environment. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption, with withdrawals measuring water applied to lands and consumption referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption. Withdrawals measure water applied to lands, while consumption refers to water taken in by plants or evaporated. Irrigation is the second-largest source of water withdrawals in the United States, but withdrawals have decreased by 23% since 1980. From 2005 to 2010, irrigation withdrawals dropped 9% nationally. It is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to a decrease in water consumption. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. However, it is unclear if this decline has reduced water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003, while several eastern states have experienced significant growth in irrigated acres. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. Changes in irrigated land across the country vary by region. Four western states have seen an increase in irrigated acres since 2003, while several eastern states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, have experienced significant growth. Farmers have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, especially in 17 western states. The shift from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation has been significant, especially in 17 western states. Gravity irrigation declined from almost 62% of irrigated acres in 1984 to 30% by 2013. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres during this time, while applied irrigation water decreased by over 1.37 million acre-feet. There has been a decline in water application since 1998, with irrigation withdrawals from on-farm surface water and water delivered to farms in the West also decreasing. Since 1998, there has been a decline in irrigation water application, with a decrease in withdrawals from on-farm surface water and water delivered to farms in the West. Despite an overall decrease in irrigation withdrawals, groundwater withdrawals have increased. Irrigated land in the East has seen significant growth since 1984, with over 8.7 million acres added, while the West has only seen a small increase in irrigated acres. Groundwater remains the highest source of irrigation withdrawals in the western-most parts of the United States. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. Withdrawals peaked in 2008, increasing by 4.3 million AF since 2003. This trend is attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to low-cost groundwater. The expanded use of groundwater for irrigation has led to a decline in aquifer levels in the East. The increased irrigated acres in the East since 2003 have been driven by factors such as higher commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to low-cost groundwater. This has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied water, considering factors like system performance and crop response. \"Irrigation efficiency is the use of applied water that is beneficially used and not lost to evaporation or seepage during conveyance, percolation, or runoff. Factors like system performance, water application uniformity, crop response, and evapotranspiration rates influence irrigation efficiency.\" The efficiency of irrigation systems is influenced by factors like sunlight, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and canopy development, which affect evapotranspiration rates and crop water requirements. Water conveyance systems also play a crucial role, with poorly constructed canals leading to conveyance losses. Efficient irrigation systems aim to maintain crop production levels while conserving water for downstream use, but studies have shown that they may sometimes result in increased water consumption. Efficient irrigation systems aim to conserve water for downstream use, but studies show that in some cases, they may lead to increased water consumption. Increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation can boost water consumption and crop yield in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically uses less water. While some case studies support expanded irrigation resulting from water conservation, it is unclear if this occurs nationwide and to what extent. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter consumes less water. Water not lost to evapotranspiration through gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation, allowing for subsequent beneficial use. Measures to limit increased water consumption, such as restricting additional irrigated crop acreage, may be necessary. Efficient irrigation technologies may not necessarily result in less water consumed overall, as they could encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure systems and gravity systems based on energy and pressure requirements. Adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may not reduce overall water consumption, as they could lead to growing more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are categorized into pressure and gravity systems based on energy and pressure needs. Precision technologies are increasingly integrated into modern irrigation systems to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Best management practices for irrigation focus on optimizing water usage. Precision technologies are increasingly common in modern irrigation systems, complementing basic irrigation methods. Best management practices for irrigation focus on improved water management, conveyance, scheduling, and application methods, based on select practices identified by USDA's NRCS. Not all irrigation technologies are considered BMPs, and the listed practices do not constitute a recommendation or endorsement. Some BMPs could apply to both pressure and gravity irrigation systems. Pressure irrigation systems pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinklers or perforated pipes. These systems are divided into two sub-categories: sprinkler and gravity systems. Success or failure of best management practices (BMPs) for irrigation depends on various factors and may require multiple practices for effectiveness. For a more comprehensive list of BMPs, refer to Appendix B. Pressure irrigation systems pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinklers or perforated pipes. They are divided into two sub-categories: sprinkler and microirrigation systems. Sprinkler irrigation uses high- to medium-pressure systems to spray water through applicators, while microirrigation uses low-pressure systems to apply water directly to the root zone of crops. Pressure irrigation systems make up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems used in the United States. Pressure irrigation systems, including center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems, make up 58-65% of irrigation systems in the US. These systems are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used for most crops, although initial costs can be high. An irrigation water management plan requires intentional preparation. An irrigation water management plan involves intentional preparation to manage water application through various irrigation systems to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, and maximize plant growth. This plan may include irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. The irrigation plan includes various BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler systems (center pivot, side roll, linear move tower), used for soil moisture, crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Microirrigation includes surface drip and micro sprinkler systems. Microirrigation systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation are efficient methods that apply water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot irrigation systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems, reducing water waste. LEPA systems apply water directly into circular furrows through nozzles close to the soil surface to reduce evaporation and energy consumption. Gravity systems divert water to flood over a crop area via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Gravity irrigation systems flood crop areas using land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. These systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems and are suited for close-growing crops like rice. Furrow irrigation systems, on the other hand, can be used for row crops such as potatoes and corn. Land leveling is reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application without puddles or dry spots. It can increase gravity irrigation efficiency, reduce erosion, and prevent water logging. Delivery of water through channels like ditches or canals is a common method in irrigation systems. Land leveling improves gravity irrigation efficiency, reduces erosion, and prevents water logging. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to the crop area. Canal linings increase conveyance efficiency, and ditch linings can be made from materials like concrete, PVC, and polypropylene. Tailwater recovery involves reusing excess water from gravity irrigation. Canal linings, made from materials like concrete, PVC, and polypropylene, increase conveyance efficiency. Tailwater recovery involves reusing excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination. An irrigation reservoir provides storage for water used in irrigation, depending on availability. An irrigation reservoir is used to store water for irrigation, with its size depending on water availability and crop needs. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones are increasingly being used in irrigation to improve efficiency. The incorporation of precision technologies in agriculture, such as satellite data and drones, has increased irrigation efficiency. Technology companies are offering services to help farmers maximize profits. NASA and USDA collaborated on the SMAP satellite mission for soil moisture monitoring. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite mission to gather soil moisture data globally. Despite radar transmission issues in 2015, the project continues using supplemental data. This technology could benefit governments and agricultural producers in making informed decisions about irrigation water usage. SMAP's radar stopped transmitting in July 2015, but supplemental data and its functioning radiometer have allowed the project to continue. This data can help governments and agricultural producers make informed decisions about irrigation water usage. Drones can be used for aerial imagery and data collection, combined with software to adjust irrigation. Sensor networks monitor plant water status, evapotranspiration, and soil water content. Data analytics uses real-time data on energy consumption and environmental conditions. Sensor networks can monitor plant water status, evapotranspiration, and soil water content for adjusting irrigation. Data analytics uses real-time data to improve decisions, leading to irrigation system automation based on gathered information. Regional weather networks help track crop evapotranspiration, allowing for an accurate irrigation schedule based on precipitation and soil moisture data. Based on regional weather networks, crop evapotranspiration data can inform the amount and frequency of water applied for irrigation. A remote monitoring system wirelessly transfers real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing water usage and field visits. Poly-pipe is utilized in furrow irrigation for efficient water distribution. The use of poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, optimized with computer software for hole sizes, can reduce water usage and irrigation runoff. Implementing irrigation best management practices can increase efficiency and reduce production costs, leading to more evenly watered fields and higher yields. Irrigation allows for double the yields compared to non-irrigated crops, enabling producers to grow more effectively. Irrigation enhances efficiency by providing precise water application, reducing production costs, and ensuring even watering across fields. It allows for double the yields of non-irrigated crops, enabling the growth of higher value crops and extending growing seasons. Irrigation BMPs can also improve production of specialty crops by delivering water only when needed, preventing issues from overwatering such as disease, pests, and reduced yields. Implementing irrigation best management practices (BMPs) can reduce costs and prevent issues from overwatering, such as disease and pest activity. These practices also allow for the simultaneous application of nutrients and pesticides, potentially reducing costs and providing more precise application. Irrigation technologies vary across the United States, with implementation choices sometimes limited by cost and crop type. Implementing efficient irrigation systems can reduce costs by allowing synthetic nutrients and pesticides to be distributed with irrigation water. Adoption of these systems is influenced by factors such as capital and operational costs, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. Economic gains from increased crop yield are a primary motivator for adopting efficient irrigation technologies. The adoption of efficient irrigation technologies by agricultural producers is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly drip irrigation systems, while growers of low-value crops are less inclined to do so. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS), 32% of respondents faced challenges in financing irrigation system improvements. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS), 32% of respondents reported challenges in financing irrigation system improvements, with 25% stating that the costs would not be covered by the improvements. High-efficiency irrigation systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip can be more expensive than gravity systems. Agricultural producers also need to consider the costs of developing a water supply, such as drilling wells or building storage facilities. The cost of developing a water supply for irrigation systems, including drilling wells or building storage facilities, can impact a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. Groundwater supply development is generally more expensive than surface water, leading to high-efficiency pressure systems in groundwater-reliant areas. High-efficiency pressure systems are more common in areas reliant on groundwater due to the higher cost of developing groundwater supplies compared to surface water. In drought-prone areas that rely on surface water, growers are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems. The type of crop being irrigated also influences the choice of irrigation system. Recent survey data in the United States reveals that many farmers are unable to use more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type and physical field conditions. For example, perennial tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay, while close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation. Widely spaced field crops that do not need total soil saturation are less effective with gravity irrigation. Local climate conditions also play a significant role in the adoption of irrigation technology. Drip and surface irrigation are more effective in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation is subject to high evaporation in arid climates. Subsurface irrigation can lead to soil salinity issues. In arid climates, sprinkler irrigation faces high evaporation levels, and subsurface irrigation can lead to soil salinity issues. Climate conditions impact crop evapotranspiration rates, influencing the choice of irrigation system. Soil type also plays a role; sandy soils benefit from sprinkler or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can accommodate various methods. When selecting an irrigation system, soil type in a crop production area is crucial. Sandy soils require sprinkler or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can use sprinkler, microirrigation, or gravity irrigation. Clay soils are best suited for gravity irrigation due to low infiltration rates. Soil surveys help in planning irrigation water management by evaluating soil characteristics. The labor-technology trade-off between pressure and gravity systems is also a factor to consider. Management planning utilizes soil surveys to evaluate soil characteristics for designing irrigation systems. Gravity irrigation can be labor-intensive compared to pressure systems, while automated sprinkler and drip systems require less labor but more technical knowledge. Water quality and quantity are barriers that can limit irrigation choices. Sprinkler and drip systems require technical knowledge and less labor compared to gravity systems. Water quality can dictate the type of irrigation system used, with sediment-heavy water best suited for gravity irrigation. Salinity and selenium concerns can be managed effectively with sprinkler or drip irrigation due to better control over water depth. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in the nation's water bodies, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws largely determine the legal water availability for farmers and irrigation districts. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not discussed. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for cleaner water for irrigation. USDA agencies offer support through education, outreach, and research, as well as federal funds for conservation programs. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not discussed in detail in this report. For more information, see CRS Report R43910, Water Resource Issues in the 114th Congress. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation BMPs adoption through programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. These programs award funding or technical support to qualified producers implementing conservation practices. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million out of $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. California and Texas received the most funding, with Arkansas also in the top 10 states. The majority of states receiving the highest amount of funding for irrigation BMPs are in the West, with California ($187 million) and Texas ($151 million) receiving the most funding. Three southeastern states are also in the top 10: Arkansas ($93 million), Mississippi ($60 million), and Louisiana ($34 million). Increasing irrigation efficiency may reduce groundwater recharge and lead to aquifer depletion, with the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers being depleted at unsustainable rates. A study on groundwater use in the United States found that the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers are being depleted at unsustainable rates, accounting for 93% of groundwater depletion from 2000 to 2008. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion or exacerbating the problem. Financial and technical assistance contracts for irrigation BMPs are awarded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs), and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) awards financial and technical assistance contracts for irrigation BMPs, Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs), and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) also provides funding for irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) provides funding for irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance, including precision technologies like regional weather networks for irrigation scheduling and remote monitoring of irrigation pumping plants. Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) also funds similar irrigation BMPs but is limited to 16 states. USDA provides technical assistance for irrigation system automation and remote monitoring of irrigation pumping plants through various funding programs, including Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) limited to 16 states. Technical assistance is an integral part of financial assistance programs for adopting irrigation technologies. The Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program helps irrigators adopt conservation plans by offering technical assistance through a national network of conservationists. While CTA does not provide financial assistance, the conservation plans developed through the program can help qualify for funding from other agencies and programs. The Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program offers technical assistance to help irrigators adopt conservation plans. While CTA does not provide financial assistance, the plans developed can help qualify for funding from other programs. CTA is available to farmers and supporting groups, funded over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013, and USDA provides information resources through various agencies. The USDA provides information resources to irrigators through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). ARS focuses on scientific research related to irrigation BMPs, including studies on improving irrigation management and scheduling. ERS conducts economic and policy studies on agriculture.

The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers federal funding for agriculture-related research at state universities, including programs related to irrigation such as the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and the National Water Quality Program (NWQP). National monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited, with the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) providing the most comprehensive national data on irrigation water use. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national irrigation water use data through surveys and assessments every five years. NASS surveys producers in the agriculture industry, while USGS assesses water resources. The methodologies and reporting schedules of the two agencies differ, making direct comparisons challenging. The Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey by NASS assesses irrigated agriculture in the US every five years. The USGS produces a water use assessment every five years, evaluating trends in water use categories including irrigation. Appendices provide information on irrigation technologies and practice codes for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program.

Sprinkler systems and microirrigation are used for crop irrigation, cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Irrigation systems include pipelines to convey water efficiently and pumping plants to deliver water at a predefined pressure and flow rate. Land leveling is also essential for effective irrigation. A pumping plant delivers water at a predefined pressure and flow rate for irrigation needs. Irrigation land leveling reshapes land to increase efficiency and prevent water loss. Water wells extract groundwater from aquifers, with considerations for potential impacts on neighboring wells and resources.
