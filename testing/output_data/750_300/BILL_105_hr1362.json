The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project. The project involves providing reimbursement from the medicare program for health care services to targeted medicare-eligible veterans in VA facilities. The Secretaries will conduct a three-year demonstration project to provide reimbursement for health care services to targeted medicare-eligible veterans in VA facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive certain medicare requirements as needed for the project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a plan for facility selection. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The selection plan will favor facilities suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals. The selection plan for facilities participating in the project will favor those suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals based on potential demand, billing capability, quality indicators, and patient satisfaction. The selection plan for facilities participating in the project will favor those suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals based on potential demand, billing capability, quality indicators, patient satisfaction, and proximity to closed military medical facilities. The selection plan for facilities participating in the project will prioritize those in the same catchment area as closed military medical facilities under specific laws. Voluntary participation is allowed for targeted Medicare-eligible individuals. The Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure Act allows voluntary participation of targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in a demonstration project with cost-sharing requirements similar to nongovernmental facilities. The Secretary will establish cost-sharing requirements for veterans in the demonstration project, which will be the same as those for targeted Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received under the project will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95% of Medicare payment rates. The Medicare program will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services at 95% of Medicare payment rates on a non-capitated basis. Payment amounts will be established by the Secretaries for services where computation is not readily available, and payments will be made periodically in line with the Medicare program. The Medicare program will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services at 95% of Medicare payment rates on a non-capitated basis. Payments will be made periodically in line with the Medicare program from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The annual limit on Medicare payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs for any year for the demonstration project may not exceed $50,000,000. Additionally, there will be a reduction in payment for failure to maintain VA effort. The annual limit on Medicare payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the demonstration project is $50,000,000. Payment amounts will be reduced if the VA fails to maintain effort to avoid shifting costs onto the Medicare program. For medicare-eligible veterans, payment amounts for a project will be reduced if actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level for the fiscal year. Maintenance of effort levels are determined annually. The maintenance of effort level for any fiscal year is determined based on the preceding fiscal year's level or the VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans in fiscal year 1997, adjusted by the same percentage as the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The maintenance of effort level for fiscal year 1997 is adjusted based on the percentage difference in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous year. Additionally, it is decreased by the estimated decrease in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans relative to the preceding fiscal year. The curr_chunk discusses the reduction in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans due to a lower rate of increase in medical care appropriations compared to health care cost increases. This results in a decrease in priority in delivering services to targeted medicare-eligible individuals. The curr_chunk highlights the reduction in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans due to a lower rate of increase in health care costs. This leads to a decrease in priority in delivering services to targeted medicare-eligible veterans. The curr_chunk explains the definition of \"VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans\" as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs on hospital care and medical services for targeted medicare-eligible veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs spent a specific amount on hospital care and medical services for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during the fiscal year, excluding expenditures for medical examinations for claims adjudication and services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, closely monitor expenditures under the medicare program for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project to ensure no increase in costs to the Medicare program. The Comptroller General audits the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the medicare program during the demonstration project and submits a report to Congress annually. The Comptroller General audits and reports to Congress annually on the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the medicare program during the demonstration project. If there is an increase in costs, a report must be submitted to Congress. If Medicare program costs increase due to a demonstration project, the Secretaries must recoup the additional expenditures and prevent future increases. The Comptroller General audits and reports to Congress annually on these costs, with a requirement to submit a report if costs rise. To recoup increased Medicare program costs from a demonstration project, the Secretary must pay the amount from the Department of Veterans Affairs' medical care appropriation to the Medicare trust funds. This is to prevent future cost increases. The Secretary can recoup Medicare program costs by transferring funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs' medical care appropriation to the Medicare trust funds, which may involve suspending or terminating a demonstration project or adjusting the percentage allocated. SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. The Secretaries will arrange for an independent entity to evaluate the health services demonstration project annually and submit a report to Congress by March 1 each year. The report will include the evaluation results and assessments. Each year, an independent entity evaluates the health services demonstration project and submits a report to Congress by March 1. The report includes an assessment of the cost of care for veterans, compliance of participating facilities with quality measures, and a comparison of participation costs with reimbursements. The evaluation report for the health services demonstration project includes a comparison of compliance with quality measures, costs of participation, savings or costs to the Medicare program, changes in access to care or quality of care for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, and the project's effect on access to care. The evaluation report for the health services demonstration project will include an assessment of any changes in access to care or quality of care for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans participating in the project, as well as the project's impact on access to care for veterans who did not participate. Additionally, a report on the extension and expansion of the demonstration project will be submitted to Congress within six months of the final report. Within six months of the final report, the Secretaries will recommend whether to extend or make permanent the health services demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites and increase reimbursement limits, and determine if project terms should be continued or modified. The Secretaries will recommend whether to extend or make permanent the health services demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites, and increase reimbursement limits. They will also assess the feasibility of establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted medicare-eligible veterans enrolled in managed health-care plans.
