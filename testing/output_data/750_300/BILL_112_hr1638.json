    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the power to regulate currency and delegate it to the Federal Reserve System. The value of the US dollar has significantly decreased compared to gold, oil, and foreign currencies. The value of the United States dollar has fallen dramatically relative to gold, crude oil, other commodities, and major foreign currencies, leading to instability and uncertainty. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not been able to provide a stable and reliable value for the dollar, which hinders economic growth. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System struggles to maintain a stable value for the United States dollar, leading to economic consequences such as increased capital costs, risks for long-term investments, higher corporate income tax rates, reduced real earnings for workers, and diminished value of financial assets and pensions. An unstable dollar negatively impacts American workers' earnings, financial assets, pension plans, and the country's global standing. It also creates anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets and the public. SEC. 3. DIRECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed not to use open market operations to regulate the dollar's value, aiming to promote stable financial markets. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to maintain the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and promote stable financial markets without using open market operations. SEC. 4. TAX DEPRECIATION. Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. SEC. 5. DIRECTIVE TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues of the tax changes in the Act on a present value basis, similar to the Social Security Trustees' calculations. This includes considering the acceleration of first-year expensing of capital investment without changing total depreciation amounts taken by taxpayers. The first-year expensing of capital investment accelerates depreciation without changing total amounts taken by taxpayers. Capital investments by businesses historically yield higher returns than government bond interest rates. SEC. 6 of the Act states that in case of conflict with the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the provisions of this Act will prevail. SEC. 7 removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves. Section 19(b)(12) of the Federal Reserve Act is amended to remove the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves."
