The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding for research projects in energy technology and supports education programs for STEM teachers and students. White House efforts, under OSTP, include fostering innovation and competitiveness activities. The United States must be competitive in a global economy to maintain economic growth and a high standard of living. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital. Scientific and technological advances drive economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, enhancing production efficiency, and compensating for cost disadvantages. Various factors influence technological progress, including government activity, firm organization, and serendipity. Technological progress is influenced by scientific advances, government activity, firm organization, and serendipity. Two policy approaches for enhancing U.S. competitiveness include direct measures like budget outlays and indirect measures such as financial incentives. The United States has used a combination of direct and indirect approaches since World War II to improve competitiveness. Since World War II, the United States has utilized direct and indirect measures to enhance competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other national economies were expressed in the Steelman report post-WWII. In the 1970s, experts worried about the rise of major competitors like Japan and Europe. The U.S. lost market share in various industries. In the 1970s, experts were concerned about the rise of major competitors like Japan and Europe, as the United States lost market share in various industries such as autos, cameras, stereos, television sets, steel, machine tools, and microelectronics. There were worries about declining U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products and lower productivity growth compared to Japan. The decline in U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products was evident as the U.S. share of world exports on R&D-intensive goods fell while Japan's share rose. Other indicators included lower productivity growth in the U.S. compared to Japan, a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers graduating from U.S. universities, and a decline in the number of patents granted to Americans. Some believed this was due to U.S. expenditures for civilian R&D falling behind Europe and Japan. The decline in U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products was evident, with indicators such as lower productivity growth, a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers graduating from U.S. universities, and a decline in patents granted to Americans. Congress responded by passing several acts to address the issue. Several acts were passed by Congress to address the decline in U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act, the Federal Technology Transfer Act, the National Cooperative Research Act, and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The creation of the SEMATECH consortium also aimed to advance the U.S. semiconductor industry. Congressional actions like the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development. The U.S. semiconductor industry saw advancements through the creation of SEMATECH and congressional actions like the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Small Business Development Act supported R&D in small firms, addressing competitiveness concerns until the mid-1990s when the economy and innovation improved. The U.S. semiconductor industry advanced with the creation of SEMATECH and congressional actions in the 1980s. The Small Business Development Act supported R&D in small firms, addressing competitiveness concerns until the mid-1990s. The U.S. economy and technological innovation improved, leading to success in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization. The U.S. economy and technological innovation improved in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization, federal science and engineering research funding, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. The globalization of the economy has a growing impact on American companies, workers, and families, with both positive and negative effects. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity, living standards, and disposable incomes in the United States. The growing impact of globalization on American companies, workers, and families includes both positive and negative effects. Increasing integration with the world economy can boost productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages, especially with rising trade with low-wage developing countries. Technology plays a key role in driving these trends by reducing communication and transportation costs. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization concerns by focusing on technology, labor supply, and government policies to enhance competitiveness in the global economy. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization concerns by focusing on technology, labor supply, and government policies that reduce barriers to trade and investment. It authorizes direct measures and committees to address these issues, including increasing federal funding for basic research in science and engineering. The America COMPETES Act aims to increase federal funding for basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science to drive technological progress and create new industries and jobs. It also focuses on funding high-risk research at small and medium-sized businesses to promote innovation and job creation.

The America COMPETES Act aims to increase federal funding for research in STEM fields to drive technological progress and create new industries and jobs. It also focuses on addressing concerns about the competitiveness of the U.S. labor pool in science and mathematics education by increasing the quality and quantity of STEM teachers and encouraging more American students to pursue advanced STEM degrees. The act also authorizes actions to identify possible government trade and investment policies to support U.S. businesses engaged in innovation. The America COMPETES Act authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify actions for the United States to support businesses in innovation. Other legislative initiatives encourage industry to invest in research and development, promote joint research activities, and facilitate technology transfer to the private sector. The America COMPETES Act aims to support businesses in innovation through research and development, joint research activities, technology transfer, and quality improvements. There are differing opinions on the best actions to enhance competitiveness, with some experts advocating for measures beyond those proposed in the Act. Some experts doubt that the actions proposed in the America COMPETES Act are the best response to competitiveness concerns. Competitiveness can vary depending on the perspective of a domestic firm, multinational corporation, or domestic labor, with a focus on trade and market share. Key measure of competitiveness is the economy's trade balance. The focus of competitiveness for a domestic firm is trade and the ability to compete for market share against imports or foreign firms in export markets. The economy's trade balance is a key measure of competitiveness, as shown in U.S. trade in advanced technology products. The U.S. had a surplus in these products, but it turned into a deficit in 2002. The United States trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. The deficit grew from $16.6 billion in 2002 to $55.5 billion in 2008, with fluctuations in between. The United States trade deficit in high technology products grew from $16.6 billion in 2002 to $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies with overseas production facilities. However, the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny for U.S. multinational corporations. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000, reaching a record $300 billion, but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor shares concerns with firms about competitiveness against foreign firms in export markets or within the United States. The United States competes with foreign firms in export markets and for domestic labor. Key measures are employment levels and wages. The U.S. is a major recipient and investor of foreign direct investments, with U.S. firms investing $249 billion abroad in 2006. The United States is the largest recipient and investor of foreign direct investments. U.S. firms invested $249 billion abroad in 2006. While some see these investments as beneficial, others are concerned about displaced workers and lower wages. Most economists believe that direct investment abroad is due to a restructuring of U.S. manufacturing industries and does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. The share of investment going to developing countries has decreased in recent years. Economists believe that direct investment abroad is a result of U.S. manufacturing industry restructuring and does not lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. NSF identifies five categories of science and engineering occupations. NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations: computer and mathematical scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, and engineers. However, this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their occupations. For example, a chemist teaching high school chemistry and an engineer managing a manufacturing plant are classified as a teacher and a manager, respectively, and are not part of NSF's analysis of the science and engineering workforce. Additionally, there are individuals in science- and engineering-related occupations who utilize science and engineering knowledge in their jobs, but may not be included in NSF's analysis. Some individuals in science and engineering-related occupations use their knowledge in non-S&E jobs like writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants. The traditional classification of S&E occupations may not fully capture the diversity of the science and engineering workforce. The science and engineering workforce includes individuals in various occupations such as writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants. The size of this workforce could be considerably larger than government analyses suggest, ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006 according to the National Science Board. The National Science Board (NSB) reported that the science and engineering workforce in 2006 varied in size from approximately 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals. NSB suggests that the most relevant number may be 17.0 million, which includes individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field. This reflects the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States. According to the NSB, the science and engineering workforce in the United States varied in size from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. The most relevant number is 17.0 million, which includes individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field. This reflects the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the country. The analysis provided by NSF's data shows the increasing need for workers with a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge. Computerization has shifted employment skills towards high-level tasks, reducing the demand for routine manual and cognitive tasks. This shift in tasks explains sixty percent of the estimated relative demand for education. The analysis found that computerization has led to a shift in employment skills towards high-level tasks, reducing the demand for routine manual and cognitive tasks. This shift explains sixty percent of the estimated relative demand for education. The U.S. Census Bureau's analysis shows a significant growth in the number of workers in science and engineering occupations, which was 7.7 times larger in 2000 than in 1950. The U.S. Census Bureau's long-term analysis of S&E workforce trends shows significant growth, with the number of workers in science and engineering occupations increasing 7.7 times larger in 2000 than in 1950. STEM growth rate in the 1990s was three times that of the overall labor force. Recent data from BLS indicates a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. The STEM workforce trends show a decline in professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with faster growth expected in computer-related occupations, life sciences, social sciences, and post-secondary teaching and healthcare professions. The growth in science and engineering occupations is projected to be 65% in computer-related fields, with faster growth expected in life sciences, social sciences, post-secondary teaching, healthcare professions, and science managers. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. It is important to note that these projections only consider demand for strictly defined S&E occupations and do not include the wider range of jobs where S&E degree holders often apply their training. Compensation for most STEM occupations is higher than the U.S. labor force average. The compensation for STEM occupations is higher than the U.S. labor force average, ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per annum. The growth rate in compensation is similar across STEM occupations. The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003. The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003, with median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree reaching $65,000 in 2003. There is significant variance among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields in terms of competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness, especially in STEM fields. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chain fragmentation, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles are not considered in current assessments. Assessing a nation's trade balance is less useful in today's global economy. The Council on Competitiveness highlights that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness, especially in STEM fields. They suggest that assessing a nation's trade balance is no longer as useful in today's global economy, where value is created through intangible assets in multinational firms. For individuals, additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered. The Council on Competitiveness emphasizes that traditional measures of competitiveness are insufficient in capturing a nation's competitiveness in STEM fields. They suggest that assessing a nation's trade balance is no longer as relevant in today's global economy, where value is created through intangible assets in multinational firms. Additionally, factors like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered for individuals to understand their prosperity. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those pursuing science and engineering careers. The America COMPETES Act is founded on the belief that STEM knowledge is crucial for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering fields. K-12 students lack proficiency in STEM due to a shortage of qualified teachers. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM expertise can inspire students to excel in STEM, leading to a more competitive workforce. There is a shortage of Americans obtaining degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, as it leads to a more competitive workforce. There is a shortage of Americans obtaining degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which hinders the generation of new ideas and industries. Individuals with STEM degrees are versatile and can work in various occupations beyond traditional roles. Science and engineering research are crucial for U.S. competitiveness. STEM degrees are crucial for generating new industries and ideas. Research in science and engineering is vital for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. However, current funding for basic research in these fields is insufficient compared to other competing countries. Increasing federal funding for science and engineering research can make the nation more competitive by creating new industries and jobs. Increasing federal funding for basic science and engineering research is crucial for enhancing U.S. competitiveness by creating new industries and jobs. Analysis shows that current funding in these fields is inadequate compared to other countries. For instance, in K-12 STEM education, American students scored lower in science literacy compared to their international peers in 2006. The OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2006 revealed that U.S. 15-year-old students scored below the international average in science and mathematics literacy. American students scored 489 points in science and 474 points in mathematics, both lower than the OECD averages. A study also highlighted that middle school math teachers in the U.S. are not as well-prepared as their counterparts in other countries, contributing to lower scores among American students. In the United States, teachers are not well-prepared to teach mathematics compared to teachers in other countries. This inadequate teacher preparation, along with deficiencies in the mathematics curriculum, contributes to lower scores for American middle-schoolers. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees globally. In 2002, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States compared to an international average of 26.4%. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, with support from the National Science Foundation, developed a research and development satellite account to estimate the impact of R&D investment on U.S. economic growth. R&D investment accounted for 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question these assumptions. If R&D were treated as investment, it could have contributed 5% to real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. federal research programs and the sufficiency of research investment to reach national goals. STEM education is seen as a state and local issue, raising doubts about the federal government's influence in this area. Some question the sufficiency of federal research programs and investments in reaching national goals, particularly in STEM education. Concerns are raised about the federal government's influence in this area and whether investments will benefit all Americans or just scientists and engineers. Additionally, doubts exist about whether these actions alone can enhance U.S. competitiveness, as other factors also play a role. Some analysts question the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education, doubting if more scientists and engineers are needed and why salaries in STEM occupations are not higher. Some analysts question the need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States and the lack of higher salaries in STEM occupations. Concerns also arise about the quality and quantity of scientists and engineers in China and India, as well as potential unintended consequences of increased funding for research programs. The act focuses on direct measures to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness, proposing increased funding and tax policy changes. Supporters argue for government assistance in technology development to allocate scarce resources effectively. The act proposes direct measures to address U.S. competitiveness concerns, focusing on technology development. Proponents debate between direct government assistance and indirect market-driven approaches. The America COMPETES Act and the American Competitiveness Initiative propose different approaches to address U.S. competitiveness concerns. Proponents debate between direct government assistance and indirect market-driven approaches. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 to address concerns about the U.S. economic competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act included provisions from the ACI, such as increased research funding and STEM education programs. The America COMPETES Act incorporated provisions from the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), including increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. It also authorized funding increases for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, established new research organizations, and requested executive agencies funding research to set priorities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research organizations like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as new research organizations. It also encourages executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward projects and emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels for U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research organizations like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as new research organizations. It emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels for U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Many organizations advocate for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. The specific rate of increase in the America COMPETES Act is based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. The America COMPETES Act calls for increased funding for research organizations like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. This report recommends a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over seven years, particularly in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences due to stagnant funding in these fields for 15 years. The Academies committee report emphasized the need for a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. Stagnant funding in these fields for 15 years has hindered support for high-potential high-risk research, which is crucial for innovation. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. This increase is necessary as corporations are unlikely to fund basic research due to its risks and societal benefits. The committee also considered the NSF Authorization Act of 2002, which authorized doubling NSF's research budget over five years. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. The committee considered the NSF Authorization Act of 2002, which authorized doubling NSF's research budget over five years. The committee believes that this rate of growth strikes an appropriate balance between the urgency of the issue being addressed and the ability of the research community to apply new funds efficiently. The Administration has not indicated why it selected a 7% annual rate for these agencies. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual increase for research agencies, despite the recommendation for a 10% increase in federal funding for basic research. The funding available is limited, but there is wide consensus on the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness. The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" emphasized the need for increased funding in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering to enhance the nation's economic competitiveness. It suggested reallocating existing funds or seeking new funds to support these areas, recognizing the limited federal funds for science. The Administration's response to the need for increased funding in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering was the American Competitiveness Initiative, proposing to double budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. NASA should also be a full participant in efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through basic scientific and engineering research. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and STEM education. It highlights the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute significantly to U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute significantly to U.S. innovation and competitiveness, enabling a fair balance of funding among its programs and full participation in interagency efforts. The Senate and House appropriations committees have expressed concerns about the President's FY2008 budget not being appropriately balanced and lacking sufficient funds for important NASA initiatives. The President's FY2008 budget for NASA is criticized for not being balanced and lacking sufficient funds for important initiatives, as highlighted by the Senate and House appropriations committees. The National Research Council also points out that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources. The federal government needs to address the mismatch between NASA's tasks and resources, and consider actions to make the agency's responsibilities sustainable. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of allocating basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that tackle fundamental challenges through multidisciplinary work. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes allocating basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that address fundamental challenges through multidisciplinary work and involve a high degree of novelty. This provision aims to support transformative research that may not fit traditional funding review mechanisms. The National Science Board found that transformative research often does not align with traditional funding review mechanisms due to reluctance from investigators to submit radical ideas, leading to a low success rate for unconventional proposals. The National Science Board found that investigators are hesitant to submit radical research ideas to NSF due to low success rates. The National Institutes of Health has also recognized this issue and created the Pioneer's Award to support high-risk research. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the importance of transformative research at NSF, defining it as revolutionary and cutting-edge. Transformative research at NSF is considered revolutionary and cutting-edge. Despite conducting research that could be transformative, no funds are specifically allocated for this purpose. The Foundation is directed to review current practices and provide a report on supporting transformational proposals within 90 days. The Appropriations Committees direct the Foundation to review current practices supporting transformational proposals and provide reports to the Committees. $10 million of NSF's budget is designated for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E as a new federal organization in DOE. The House Committee on Appropriations allocated $10 million of NSF's budget for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in DOE, with the goal of enhancing economic and energy security through the development of advanced energy technologies. ARPA-E aims to reduce foreign energy imports, lower energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy efficiency across all sectors, and establish the US as a leader in advanced energy technologies. It operates based on the DARPA model, focusing on revolutionary scientific advances, translating discoveries into innovations, and accelerating technological breakthroughs in areas where industry may not invest due to technical and financial uncertainties. ARPA-E, based on the DARPA model, aims to accelerate technological advances in areas with technical and financial uncertainties. The concept for ARPA-E was inspired by the DARPA research management model used by the Department of Defense. Similar initiatives have been proposed historically. Although the concept for ARPA-E in the act was based on the DARPA model, similar initiatives have been proposed historically, including an advanced civilian technology agency in the 100th and 101st Congresses. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. The National Academy of Sciences report recommended the government consider a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies and fuels. ARPA-E, with objectives outlined by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, aims to bring excitement and a sense of mission to energy research. ARPA-E, as outlined by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, aims to bring excitement and a sense of mission to energy research by focusing on creative, transformational research that industry may not support. The organization should be flat, nimble, and capable of setting long-term goals. The report proposed creating an ARPA-like organization for innovative research in energy, bridging gaps between research, development, and industrial innovation. Funding for ARPA-E was suggested to start at $300 million. The report proposed creating an ARPA-like organization for innovative research in energy, with funding starting at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion per year. It was emphasized that ARPA-E funding should not jeopardize basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. The National Academies committee emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science when funding ARPA-E. They suggested that the organization and mission of ARPA-E should be determined through consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities.

Additionally, the act requires OSTP to develop principles for open data exchange among federal scientists and engineers, which was addressed by the Bush Administration in a memorandum to research sponsor agencies. The Bush Administration OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies sponsoring research, emphasizing the importance of open communication of scientific information for advancing science and informing society to make sound decisions. The Federal government emphasizes scientific openness for informing society and making sound decisions. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. Exceptions exist for privileged information. The NASA policy allows employees to speak to the press and public about their work, with exceptions for privileged information. The America COMPETES Act designated actions for OSTP, but no action seems to have been taken by the Bush Administration. These actions include a study on barriers to innovation, a National Technology and Innovation Medal, Semiannual Science, Technology, and Mathematics Days, a study of service science, national coordination of research infrastructure, and a Sense of Congress on innovation acceleration research. (Summary from Appendix B, Title I) The America COMPETES Act designated various actions for OSTP, including a National Technology and Innovation Medal, Semiannual Science, Technology, and Mathematics Days, a study of service science, national coordination of research infrastructure, and a Sense of Congress on innovation acceleration research. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009, after a hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. During his testimony, Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of communication of scientific and technical information by federal scientists and engineers. Dr. Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009. During his testimony, he emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, regardless of political implications. If confirmed, he stated this would be one of his highest obligations. If confirmed as OSTP Director, Dr. Holdren will prioritize ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, working with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of technical judgments. He mentioned the America Competes Act during his testimony. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of scientific integrity in the federal government, highlighting the America Competes Act's requirement to prevent censorship or distortion of research findings. Developing clear policies for disseminating research results is crucial to achieving this goal. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009, assigning OSTP the responsibility for ensuring integrity in the federal government's involvement with scientific processes. This includes clarifying policies for disseminating research results and providing training to managers, researchers, and public information staff. President Obama assigned OSTP the responsibility for ensuring scientific integrity in the executive branch. Within 120 days, the Director was tasked with developing recommendations for Presidential action to guarantee integrity based on specific principles. The executive branch should prioritize scientific integrity in candidate selection, agency procedures, and policy decisions by following established scientific processes and accurately reflecting information. The executive branch should prioritize scientific integrity in policy decisions by following established scientific processes and accurately reflecting information, including making scientific findings available to the public. Each agency should have procedures in place to address instances where the scientific process is not followed. Each agency should ensure scientific integrity in policy decisions by making scientific findings public, addressing compromised information, and adopting necessary procedures to safeguard scientific and technological processes. Each agency must ensure scientific integrity by providing whistleblower protections and necessary information to the Director for recommendations to the President. Coordination with the Director is required for developing interim procedures to safeguard scientific decision-making. The Director must work with agencies to develop interim procedures to protect scientific decision-making integrity. Funding details for America COMPETES Act programs can be found in CRS reports. The America COMPETES Act programs received funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act, with some programs funded at authorized levels while others were not. ARPA-E received $415.0 million in FY2009, exceeding the $300.0 million authorization. In FY2009, ARPA-E received $415.0 million in funding, surpassing the authorized level of $300.0 million. The future funding levels for programs may pose challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by certain programs, especially those focused on research or education. The FY2009 funding levels for programs may pose challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by certain programs, especially those focused on research or education. The budget proposed in FY2009 did not align with the America COMPETES Act, making it difficult to determine the status of these programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request also did not realign existing programs with the America COMPETES Act, leading to uncertainty about funding for new programs. Insufficient evidence exists that new America COMPETES Act programs are funded at this time. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request did not realign existing programs with the America COMPETES Act, leading to uncertainty about funding for new programs such as DOE Pilot Program of Grants to Specialty Schools for Science and Mathematics, Summer Institutes, and Early Career Awards for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Researchers. Insufficient evidence exists that these new programs are funded at this time. The Energy Education Development Nuclear Science Talent Expansion Program, Hydrocarbon Systems Science Talent Expansion Program, and other science and education programs are being considered for funding in the FY2010 appropriation. The Obama Administration requested FY2010 funding for America COMPETES Act programs, aiming for the highest levels in U.S. history. Several newly authorized programs have not received appropriations yet. The Obama Administration requested FY2010 funding for America COMPETES Act programs, aiming for the highest levels in U.S. history. Several newly authorized programs have not received appropriations yet, raising concerns about their funding. The America COMPETES Act provides authorization levels only through FY2010. Congress may appropriate funds for the act's actions, but measuring success is challenging due to various influencing factors. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the United States' first-place ranking in international competitiveness, despite increasing science and technology investments by other nations. Evaluation mechanisms are in place to assess the act's impact. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the United States' top international competitiveness ranking despite other countries' increasing science and technology investments. Evaluation mechanisms and longitudinal analysis by international organizations assess competitiveness using various criteria. In assessing a nation's competitiveness, it is important to consider that there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. Various indicators of innovation activity are available, but adding them together may not accurately assess innovation or a nation's competitiveness. Other factors like necessity or serendipity also play a critical role in evaluating the quality of innovation. Innovation indicators are not a definitive measure of a nation's competitiveness. Factors like necessity and serendipity also play a crucial role in assessing innovation quality and its impact on economic growth. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee innovative technologies or their market adoption. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee innovative technologies or their market adoption, as innovation can also occur due to market demand, perceived need, or minor alterations in existing products and processes. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a major role in funding R&D and innovation, with a focus on research funding in America COMPETES. The government, industrial sector, and universities are key players in funding R&D and innovation. While federal funding focuses on basic research, the industrial sector is crucial for technological development. University-industry cooperation bridges the gap between research and industry by educating scientists, engineers, and managers. It is important to consider R&D funding in relation to the gross domestic product. University-industry cooperation plays a vital role in connecting basic research with industry by educating scientists, engineers, and managers. When analyzing R&D funding, it is essential to consider the differences between defense and non-defense research, as well as the allocation of funds within different industrial sectors. For instance, more investment in electronic industries may impact the overall industry R&D landscape. Industry R&D funding varies based on the nature of investment, such as research versus development and allocation within different sectors. Patent data may indicate innovation, but not all outcomes are patentable. Some companies choose not to patent to protect ideas or due to time constraints. The state of innovation is not solely determined by R&D outcomes that can be patented. Some companies and individuals opt not to patent to keep ideas confidential or due to time constraints. The number of scientists and engineers may not fully represent a nation's innovative capacity, as new industries can be created by individuals with or without college degrees. Government policy focuses on creating an environment conducive to innovation rather than guaranteeing specific outcomes. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment for innovation to flourish, rather than guaranteeing specific outcomes. Both international and U.S. government monitoring is important to make policy adjustments as other nations take similar actions to increase their innovation environment. Various mechanisms within the act are designed to measure its effectiveness at different levels. The U.S. government focuses on creating an innovation-friendly environment, with monitoring and assessments essential for policy adjustments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness oversees the implementation of laws and initiatives, advising on global competitiveness trends and making recommendations. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness monitors and advises on laws and initiatives related to promoting innovation. It also identifies opportunities, makes recommendations for improvement, and develops metrics to measure progress in innovation, talent development, investment, and infrastructure. Additionally, it evaluates specific research and education programs, such as ARPA-E. The government focuses on improving innovation conditions through talent development, investment, and infrastructure. Evaluation of research and education programs, such as ARPA-E, is conducted by the National Academy of Sciences to assess their effectiveness. Federal research programs are also evaluated based on quality, relevance, and performance. The White House guidelines require federal research programs to be evaluated based on quality, relevance, and performance. Agencies use a merit-based, competitive process to determine which research activities to fund. DOE summer institutes must submit an annual report to Congress on the impact of improving STEM teaching skills and increasing the number of participating teachers. The DOE summer institutes and recipients of grants in STEM education programs are required to evaluate their impact on increasing STEM teachers and improving student achievement. The Master's program in STEM education and teacher certification aim to increase the number of new STEM teachers in high-need schools, promote diversity in STEM teaching, bring STEM professionals into teaching, and retain program participants. An annual independent evaluation is conducted to assess the impact on student academic achievement, with reports submitted to relevant committees. The Master's program in STEM education and teacher certification aims to increase new STEM teachers in high-need schools, promote diversity, bring STEM professionals into teaching, and retain participants. An annual independent evaluation assesses impact on student academic achievement, with reports submitted to relevant committees. Monitoring mechanisms exist to evaluate U.S. competitiveness, including inputs, outputs, and outcomes like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD's Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard. The WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard provide useful indicators on innovation and trade competitiveness. The WEF report ranks countries based on data and surveys of business leaders, while the OECD report offers information on innovation strategies and trade patterns. The 2007-2008 Global Competitiveness report for the United States, as shown in Figure 5, provides information on innovation, trade competitiveness, and productivity. Output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages are analyzed. Different audiences are interested in various output indicators, as discussed in the section on competitiveness definition. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are involved in collecting this data. Output indicators like employment and wages are monitored by agencies like the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report to track the health of the science and engineering sector. The BEA is conducting an experimental analysis on the contribution of R&D to GDP growth. The BEA, on behalf of NSF, is analyzing the impact of R&D on GDP growth. Input indicators like education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are monitored to identify policy areas for improvement. The reports track these indicators to assess the US competitiveness compared to other countries. The United States needs to focus on policy areas related to education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity to improve competitiveness. Despite being ranked number one overall in competitiveness, the US does not rank first in all input/output indicators. Key sub-indicators include quality of primary education (28th), quality of math and science education in higher education (45th), and capacity for innovation (9th) out of 131 countries. The America COMPETES Act programs are related to sub-indicators such as quality of primary education (28th), quality of math and science education in higher education (45th), capacity for innovation (9th), quality of scientific research institutions (2nd), and availability of scientists and engineers (12th) out of 131 countries. State-level competitiveness analysis is also available, with indicators influenced by the Act. The America COMPETES Act influences various input/output indicators in state-level competitiveness analyses. Different organizations use unique indicators such as human capital investment, research and development inputs, risk capital, technology workforce, and technology concentration. Factors like high-tech jobs, scientists, engineers, R&D expenditures, and workforce educational attainment are considered in these analyses. The America COMPETES Act impacts state-level competitiveness analyses by considering factors like high-tech jobs, scientists, engineers, R&D expenditures, and workforce educational attainment. The act requires subsequent appropriation acts to fund new programs and authorized increases in appropriations for existing programs. The 110th Congress provided FY2008 appropriations for ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program. The America COMPETES Act requires subsequent appropriation acts to fund new programs and authorized increases in appropriations for existing programs. The 110th Congress provided FY2008 appropriations for ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program, NIST's Technology Improvement Program (TIP), and the 111th Congress provided FY2009 appropriations for DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program. Portions of the P-16 Alignment of Secondary School Graduate Requirements with the Demands of 21st Century Postsecondary Endeavors and Support for P-16 Education Data Systems were funded through the ARRA. In FY2009, appropriations were provided for DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program, as well as for portions of the P-16 Alignment of Secondary School Graduate Requirements. Some America COMPETES Act research and STEM education programs received authorized appropriations, while others did not. The issue for Congress in FY2010 is whether to provide appropriations for America COMPETES Act programs that have never been funded before. The FY2010 budget deliberations in Congress focus on funding for America COMPETES Act programs. Some newly authorized programs have not received appropriations yet, raising concerns about their establishment. Observers are interested in the impact of funding decisions on U.S. competitiveness and global economic role. The America COMPETES Act programs are being funded by Congress, with some policymakers monitoring its impact on U.S. competitiveness and the global economy. This will test if investments in R&D and STEM education can enhance the country's competitive position.
