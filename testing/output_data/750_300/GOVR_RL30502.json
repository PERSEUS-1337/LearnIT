Congress has provided funding since 1994 to upgrade ACS and develop its replacement, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), but Customs has struggled with upkeep.

The development, operation, and maintenance of ACE over 7 years will cost between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs will begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. GAO testified that Customs had taken deliberate steps to implement recommendations by reducing duplication of effort and improving acquisition management. The development of ACE is a complex and high-risk endeavor supporting Customs' revenue collection from imports. The development of ACE is a high-risk endeavor that supports Customs' revenue collection from imports through user fee programs. Customs relies on user fee programs like COBRA and MPF for funding, with COBRA fee receipts increasing significantly from FY1992 to FY2000. COBRA fee receipts are not appropriated by Congress and play a substantial role in Customs' annual expenditure. COBRA fee receipts have increased from $176,000,000 to $299,000,000 from FY1992 to FY2000, funding permanent inspector positions and information technology costs. Surplus revenues can be carried over and used for recurring costs. However, there have been recent reports of a drop-off in COBRA fee receipts. The COBRA fee receipts have been used to fund permanent inspector positions and information technology costs, with a recent drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts. This reliance on COBRA fees may lead to issues in funding base positions and overtime for Customs officers in the coming year, especially as the authorization for COBRA fees expires at the end of FY2003.

Both the President's request and H.R. 4871 would have funded the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses account at $5 million. The Senate-reported version of the bill would have funded the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses account at $4.3 million, while H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 proposed funding it at $8.9 million, including $3.9 million for security enhancements at the Vice President's residence.
