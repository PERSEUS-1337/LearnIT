    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. It provides background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and describes current U.S. practices. This report provides background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and describes unresolved issues related to program development. It also includes a brief chronology of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and international organizations involved in setting standards for animal health and trade. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and the introduction of a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability by USDA. This new program aims to establish a national capability for animal disease traceability. The USDA announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and introduced a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new program allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. Under the new Animal Disease Traceability framework, USDA will require all animals moving in interstate commerce to have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to regulate interstate movement of farm-raised livestock. USDA has been collaborating with state and tribal officials to establish a Traceability Regulation Working Group. USDA collaborated with state and tribal officials to establish a Traceability Regulation Working Group for animal disease traceability. The group is responsible for making recommendations for a proposed rule, and APHIS held meetings for feedback on the new framework. APHIS held a forum in March 2010 for animal health officials to discuss the new framework for animal disease traceability. In August 2010, USDA released publications outlining current recommendations for a proposed rule. The USDA's Disease Traceability Framework is still developing, with key principles emphasizing that states and tribal nations are responsible for managing traceability programs. States have the option to implement mandatory animal ID and traceability capabilities under the revised framework. The USDA's Disease Traceability Framework is still developing, with states and tribal nations responsible for managing traceability programs. States can choose to have no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems for diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis, or develop their own detailed ID system. Data collection and storage will be done by state, not federal, authorities. The USDA's Disease Traceability Framework is still in development, with states and tribal nations responsible for implementing within-state programs. Federal rules will apply to livestock in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined in the rules, such as cattle moving directly to slaughter being exempt. Types of acceptable official identification will also be defined at the federal level. The USDA's Disease Traceability Framework requires official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection for livestock in interstate commerce. Exemptions will be defined in the rules, such as cattle moving directly to slaughter being exempt. Types of acceptable official identification will be determined at the federal level. Performance standards for animal disease traceability capacity will be evaluated for each state and tribal nation through rulemaking. The Traceability Regulation Working Group will define performance standards that describe desired outcomes without specifying the method for achieving them. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal traceability. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual agreements. No funding for animal traceability is designated in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill. The USDA will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations and rulemaking processes, with funding potentially available after needs are identified under a new initiative. The USDA will implement animal disease traceability through federal regulations and rulemaking processes, defining it in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A proposed rule could be published in April 2011 with a 60- to 90-day comment period, leading to a final rule release 12 to 15 months later. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have resulted in the slaughter of animals. The proposed rule for animal disease traceability could take 12 to 15 months before the final rule is released. Outbreaks of harmful animal diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease have led to the slaughter of millions of animals and significant economic damages. The economic impact extends beyond the farm to disrupt markets domestically and internationally, affecting consumers. If a Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak were to hit the United States, it could result in economic consequences ranging from $30 billion to $100 billion for the cattle industry alone, causing disruptions in domestic and international markets and impacting consumers. The proposed rule for animal disease traceability may take 12 to 15 months before finalization, with past outbreaks of diseases like avian influenza and mad cow disease leading to the slaughter of millions of animals and significant economic losses. In 2001, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson warned that a Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak in the United States could cost the cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion. This led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. The 1990s and early 2000s disease outbreaks prompted the development of animal identification and traceability systems in various countries. Programs range from voluntary in the United States to mandatory in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products for market access. Some major importers like Japan and South Korea are discussing the possibility of requiring traceability on imported meat products for market access. This could have economic implications for U.S. livestock industries, as the United States is a leading producer and exporter of livestock and animal products. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It is also a top exporter of pork and beef, while being the leading importer of beef. U.S. exports of animal products play a significant role in the domestic market.

It is also a top exporter of pork and beef, while being the leading importer of beef. U.S. exports of animal products play a significant role in the domestic market. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes. Animal identification (ID) involves tracking individual farm animals or groups for ownership, traceability, and prevention of thievery. Today, it includes information on origins, genetics, and traceability back through the marketing chain. A national database combined with traceability is seen as the ideal system for quick response. A national database of animal ID combined with traceability is essential for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different countries have varying animal ID systems, collecting information on birthplace and date. Different animal ID systems exist in various countries, with differences in the information collected, such as birthplace, owner details, movements, and slaughter information. More advanced systems include data on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. In the United States, animal ID systems focus on health and traceability from birth to slaughter. This includes details on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement for rapid response to health and safety concerns. In the United States, animal ID systems focus on health and traceability from birth to slaughter, while other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive traceability systems that extend to the retail consumer. International buyers of U.S. animal products are demanding better traceability. In the United States, animal ID systems focus on health and traceability from birth to slaughter. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive traceability systems that extend to the retail consumer. International buyers of U.S. animal products are demanding better traceability, including information on the products' history and marketing chain. Traceability systems respond to these demands and have evolved in the United States, with proponents and critics. A national animal ID and traceability system has evolved in the United States to meet demands for better traceability in the marketing chain. Proponents argue that it enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication, while critics raise concerns about the program. An animal ID and traceability system can enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of disease outbreaks and reducing producers' testing costs. It also helps minimize the economic impact of outbreaks by identifying sources and exposed populations, allowing for containment measures. Implementing an animal ID and traceability program can reduce producers' disease testing costs and control disease outbreaks at regional and national levels. Regionalization or compartmentalization helps contain outbreaks to specific zones, limiting the spread of diseases and reducing the number of animals that need to be destroyed. Implementing an animal ID and traceability program can reduce producers' disease testing costs and control disease outbreaks at regional and national levels. Rapid identification and compartmentalization of a disease outbreak limits the spread of commercially harmful diseases, facilitates re-establishing international market access, and increases domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers. Implementing an animal ID and traceability program can reduce producers' disease testing costs and control disease outbreaks. This can limit the spread of harmful diseases, facilitate international market access, and increase domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers. Farmers can exploit desirable production characteristics like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\" to command higher prices in certain retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food help manage inventories and monitor consumer buying habits for products like meat, eggs, and milk raised according to specific standards. Food, including meats, is widely used by processors and retailers to manage inventories, add value, and monitor consumer buying. ID and traceability help verify production methods for organic, humane treatment, and environmental standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, provide livestock and meat producers with process verification to assure consistent quality products. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service operates a verification program that allows livestock and meat producers to confirm their manufacturing processes through independent audits. This \"Process Verified\" program enables suppliers to make marketing claims about breeds and feeding practices. Other traceability programs include the national organic certification program overseen by AMS. A voluntary fee-for-service traceability program provides valuable management tools for producers by tracking post-mortem information on cattle and performance history. This program complements other traceability programs like the national organic certification and mandatory country-of-origin labeling programs overseen by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. An animal ID and traceability program would provide post-mortem information on cattle, track performance history of animals, increase transparency in the supply chain, reduce liability claims, and help maintain records on animal movements and health. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns. An animal ID and traceability program helps livestock producers maintain records on animal movements, health, and breed registries, reducing liability claims. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. Some believe a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls and help contain the spread of foodborne illnesses. However, others, particularly in the food industry, disagree, citing concerns about the system being costly and technically unworkable. Enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products through traceability systems can reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meet foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. This also helps in assuring credible attributes of animal products to consumers, improving opportunities for niche markets. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants after BSE appeared in North America in 2003. This program helps meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan, a key market for U.S. beef. AMS sets standards for export programs certifying production processes for niche markets. After BSE appeared in North America in 2003, USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. The program establishes standards for U.S. suppliers to ship beef to foreign markets, enhancing competitiveness of U.S. exports. Establishing an internationally recognized system of traceability is crucial for accessing foreign markets and enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. exports of animals and animal products. The lack of a standardized national animal identification system hindered the United States from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health, which would improve international competitiveness and support domestic price structures. Establishing an animal ID system is important for accessing foreign markets and improving U.S. export competitiveness. It could also enhance animal welfare during natural disasters by helping locate at-risk animals. Opponents argue that it invades privacy. Opponents argue that an animal ID and traceability system constitutes an invasion of privacy, as it involves collecting personal identification information and production methods, which could potentially lead to the disclosure of proprietary information. Critics argue that implementing an animal ID and traceability system could lead to government invasion of privacy and the disclosure of proprietary information. They also raise concerns about increased costs and technical complexity, with a USDA-funded analysis showing that the majority of the expenses would fall on the cattle sector. The USDA-funded benefit-cost analysis of animal ID implementation in the United States found that over 90% of the annual cost would fall on the cattle sector. The technology requirements could increase operational complexity and exceed operators' capabilities, potentially favoring vertical integration over family farms. The implementation of a national ID program in the cattle industry is expected to disproportionately burden cattle producers with the costs of tagging individual animals. This added cost factor could disadvantage small operators who are unable to spread the expenses over large operations, potentially eroding their profit margins. Critics argue that implementing a national ID program in the cattle industry would unfairly disadvantage small operators and family farms due to increased costs and a lack of market power in price structures. Additionally, certain religious groups object to the program on religious grounds. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms and ranches, making it harder for smaller, independent operations to survive. Some religious groups oppose individual animal marking as a sign of the apocalypse. Producers may resist increased transparency in livestock reporting due to concerns about higher tax liabilities. Some producers are concerned that increased transparency in livestock reporting may lead to higher tax liabilities. A national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts, overseen by USDA's APHIS in consultation with state veterinary authorities. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees animal health programs for disease eradication and control, including animal identification components like brucellosis ID tags. This program has successfully eradicated brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in the need for animal ID. The brucellosis eradication program successfully reduced brucellosis in U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID requirements. Certain livestock classes need official identification before interstate commerce due to disease programs for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. Identification requirements for animals entering interstate commerce vary depending on disease programs such as pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. These programs are not national in scope and have different methods of animal identification and record keeping. U.S. animal ID limitations were highlighted after the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was proposed after U.S. animal ID limitations were exposed following the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003. This system aimed to address difficulties in tracing cattle movements after the BSE cases. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, proposed after the discovery of BSE in 2003, aimed to address difficulties in tracing cattle movements. It was based on a state-federal-industry partnership and allowed producers to voluntarily participate in national animal health safeguarding efforts. The NAIS program was a voluntary national animal health safeguarding effort for producers. USDA replaced NAIS with a state-based program due to criticism from the cattle sector over cost and implementation burdens. The NAIS program, intended to cover various livestock species, faced criticism from the cattle sector over cost and implementation burdens. The new system replacing NAIS is still relevant to livestock producers. The NAIS program aimed to establish a nationwide animal ID system for major commercial livestock and poultry species in the United States, excluding household pets. Animals entering commerce or interacting with others at events needed to be identified, with group identification allowed for species like hogs and poultry. The NAIS program focused on identifying animals entering commerce or interacting with others at events, allowing group identification for species like hogs and poultry. USDA's role was to popularize the program, provide information to participants, and prioritize implementation based on disease concerns and traceability. The USDA focused on popularizing the NAIS program, ensuring access to information for participants, prioritizing implementation based on disease concerns, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states, tribes, and territories, collaborating with industry, and advancing ID technologies. The USDA prioritized popularizing the NAIS program, ensuring access to information for participants, and collaborating with industry to advance ID technologies. USDA published reports with participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies to support the program. The USDA prioritized popularizing the NAIS program, ensuring access to information for participants, and collaborating with industry to advance ID technologies. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability detailed recommended strategies and actions to enable existing state and federal regulated and voluntary animal health programs, industry-administered animal health and marketing programs, and various animal identification techniques to work in harmony to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide provided guidance to producers and owners of animals on how to participate in NAIS. The NAIS User Guide, published in November 2006, offered guidance to animal producers on participating in NAIS and its benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for premises and animal identification numbers. The NAIS User Guide, published in November 2006, provided guidance on participating in NAIS and its benefits, including data element formats for premises identification numbers, animal identification numbers, and group/lot identification numbers. Standards for official identification devices utilizing the animal identification number were also included, along with technology standards published by ISO. Compliance with these standards by various entities involved in NAIS would enhance system effectiveness and protect U.S. agriculture's commercial interests. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect U.S. agriculture from the harm of animal disease outbreaks. Specific goals included increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and protecting animal producers' livelihoods. NAIS was not a food safety program but could have positive public safety effects. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to increase disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, protect animal producers' livelihoods, and maintain market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem by providing rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to provide rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history to help contain disease outbreaks and limit commercial damage. It aims to identify involved animals, their current locations, and potential exposure to disease for quick traceback in the commercial marketing chain. NAIS was created to facilitate quick traceback of animal diseases in the commercial marketing chain by collecting information through premises registration, animal identification, and tracking. States and tribes had to meet USDA's data standards for premises registration by registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. The first phase of NAIS involved registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact person, address or coordinates, phone numbers, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and reasons for retirement. The unique seven-digit PIN was permanently assigned to each location. The premises registration for the NAIS involved collecting specific information like coordinates, contact phone numbers, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and reasons for retirement. A unique seven-digit PIN was assigned to each location, which would not change with ownership. Registration was free and done through state or tribal animal health authorities. Premises registration for the NAIS involved collecting specific information and was free through state or tribal animal health authorities. USDA maintained the premises information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks and protect private information. Premises information is crucial for quickly notifying producers of disease outbreaks and protecting private information. By registering premises, animal health officials can locate at-risk animals during emergencies and take necessary actions to minimize hardships and eradicate diseases. However, as of September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. Higher participation levels are needed according to USDA. Only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS by September 6, 2009, out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. Higher participation levels are needed for successful implementation according to USDA. The second phase of NAIS involves assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups. The Animal Identification Number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit number used for animals like swine or poultry in confined lots. The first three digits represent the country code, with the US code always being 840. Tags and devices complying with the 15-digit AIN system are known as 840 devices. Animal ID under NAIS was achieved by obtaining USDA-recognized 840 devices from authorized manufacturers, including visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders. USDA did not specify any particular technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. RFID tags and injectable transponders are used for electronic identification of animals, allowing for faster access to information without the need for direct contact. This technology eliminates the stress of approaching or restraining animals, improving data quality. RFID and electronic transponder devices are increasingly used for faster access to ID information in animals, eliminating the need for direct contact and reducing stress. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS, such as those that never leave their birth premises or are moved directly to custom slaughter for personal consumption. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises, regardless of the number of animals present, to prevent the spread of diseases. The person caring for the animal can choose when to attach an ID, whether shortly after birth or later. The USDA recommends registering premises to prevent disease spread. The person caring for the animal can choose when to attach an ID, either shortly after birth or later. The animal should have an ID attached before moving to another location. If unable to tag at current premises, tagging can be done at an auction market before commingling with other animals. Producers can choose to tag their animals at an auction market if unable to do so at their current premises. Animals should have official identification when brought into an operation, with no additional tagging required. Animals in the production chain can be identified by group/lot identification numbers (GINs) instead of individual numbers, commonly used in poultry and pork industries. GIN is a 15-character number including a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date of assembly, and a two-digit number. The GIN is a 15-character number that includes a seven-character PIN, a six-digit assembly date, and a two-digit count of groups. It is self-generated by the producer and links each producer's livestock to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin. The GIN of each group is maintained by the producer at the premises in management records, while the ID remains with the animal for its lifetime. The uniform numbering system links each producer's livestock to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin. The identification protocol is tailored to different species groups and their unique characteristics. The third phase of NAIS focuses on timely access to accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak and contain the disease within a defined region. The third phase of NAIS involves accessing timely, accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak and contain the disease within a defined region. Producers can select a NAIS-compliant animal tracking database to report animal movements, with minimum tracing information required for participation. This includes the national premises identification number (PIN) and the animal ID number (AIN) or group ID. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) requires minimum standardized tracing information for animal movements, including the national premises identification number (PIN), animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN), date of the event, and event type. Additional animal-specific data like age, species, and sex are standardized but not necessary for participation. This information is recorded each time a notable movement between locations occurs. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS involves a public/private partnership where industry and states maintain animal location and movement records in ATDs to safeguard animal health. Movements within a production unit for management purposes are not required to be reported for NAIS. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states maintain ATDs containing animal location and movement records. States and private entities, not the federal government, would operate and maintain the ATDs to assure confidentiality for participants. USDA would operate a portal system for animal health officials to request information from ATD administrators during an animal disease event. The USDA would operate the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to enable animal health officials to request information from ATD administrators during disease outbreaks. The ATDs provide timely reports on potentially exposed animals and their contacts, with optimal data retrieval within 48 hours for efficient disease containment. The USDA operates the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to facilitate disease containment by providing timely reports on potentially exposed animals and their contacts. The system is used in specific situations such as confirmed positive tests for foreign animal diseases, animal disease emergencies, or the need for traceback/traceforward to determine infection origins. About 40% of potential premises were covered by the system as of September 2008. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered for disease containment purposes, with varying participation rates across species and states. By September 6, 2009, over 531,000 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered in available databases. According to USDA, 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the United States were registered in databases by September 6, 2009, with varying participation rates across species and states. Achieving a \"critical mass\" level of participation is necessary for an effective response to an animal disease outbreak. To achieve an effective response to an animal disease outbreak, USDA stated that a \"critical mass\" level of 70% participation is necessary for animals in a specific species to be identified and traceable to their premises of origin. Dr. John Clifford emphasized the importance of this participation rate for effective traceability measures. Dr. John Clifford, USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer, emphasized the need for a 70-90% participation rate in animal ID programs for effective traceability. Critics have faulted USDA for slow progress and lack of clarity in achieving universal ID. The Government Accountability Office identified various obstacles to implementing animal ID effectively. Some supporters criticize USDA for slow progress and lack of clarity in achieving universal animal ID. A 2007 GAO report highlighted obstacles like prioritization issues and lack of integration with existing requirements. USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address these criticisms. The USDA's NAIS Business Plan (2008) aimed to address criticisms of slow progress and lack of clarity in achieving universal animal ID. Some believe that the wide differences among producers and interests have hindered progress. USDA officials expressed concern over low participation rates in the voluntary program, calling for Congress to increase incentives or make the program mandatory. The USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address criticisms of slow progress and lack of clarity in achieving universal animal ID. Concerns were raised about low participation rates in the voluntary program, leading to calls for Congress to increase incentives or make participation mandatory. Various organizations, including the AVMA and state animal health officials, supported mandatory participation in NAIS. In October 2006, various organizations including the AVMA, state animal health officials, consumer advocacy groups, and livestock industry groups like NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, supported mandatory participation in NAIS. Over 78,000 veterinarians in the US addressed Congress in favor of mandatory animal ID for all breeding cattle. Several livestock industry groups, including NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, support a mandatory animal identification system known as NAIS. Key lawmakers like Collin Peterson and Rosa DeLauro also back the program to prevent losses from diseases. On the other hand, opposition to mandatory NAIS comes mainly from the cattle industry, with groups like R-CALF being vocal opponents. Groups supporting NAIS see it as crucial to prevent losses from diseases, while opponents from the cattle industry like R-CALF and NCBA fear high costs and favoritism towards large producers. They also question USDA's ability to keep information confidential. The cattle industry fears high costs for equipment in implementing the NAIS system, which could disadvantage small producers. Concerns have been raised about the confidentiality of information. Some members of Congress from cattle-producing areas share these concerns. Former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns addressed these concerns by announcing changes in August 2006. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to determine if NAIS is voluntary or mandatory. In August 2006, Secretary Johanns announced NAIS would remain voluntary. Proponents argue Secretary Vilsack should make it mandatory. An animal ID system incurs costs for tags and devices. Secretary Vilsack has the authority to make NAIS mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry, which would incur costs for tags, devices, and data systems. The extent of traceability increases costs, with estimates varying widely. A key policy question is who should bear these costs - the industry, government, or both. USDA's proposals suggest cost-sharing. The policy question of who should bear the costs of traceability in the U.S. livestock industry is a key issue. USDA's proposals suggest cost-sharing between the industry and government, with concerns that compliance costs may be shifted back to farms and ranches, impacting smaller, independent operations. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs back to farms and ranches, making it harder for smaller, independent operations to survive. Some argue that larger, vertically integrated operations are better equipped to handle these costs. However, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds could benefit from traceability requirements, potentially finding niche market opportunities. APHIS released a study in 2009 on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. \"APHIS released a study in 2009 on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. Fabrication speeds may benefit from traceability requirements, potentially finding niche market opportunities.\" The 2009 KSU Benefit-Cost Study estimated annual costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry at approximately $228 million. Key assumptions included individual ID tagging for cattle, group ID tagging for swine (except cull breeding animals), and uniquely group ID tagging for poultry. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated annual costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry at approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Costs increase to $304.2 million when horses are included. Over 90% of the costs are associated with the cattle sector, amounting to $5.97 per animal marketed due to individual animal ID requirements. The cattle sector incurs the majority of costs for implementing a traceability system, with an average cost of $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags for cattle make up 75% of the annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal depending on current practices. Other livestock like swine, sheep, goats, and poultry can be traced using premises and group lot information, resulting in lower costs. The estimated tag and tagging costs for cattle producers ranged from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal, compared to the average cost of $5.97 per marketed animal in the cattle industry. Other livestock sectors had lower costs, such as $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study showed that the economic benefits of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with full participation outweighed the costs, leading to savings in government administration and disease control programs. The benefits of NAIS with full participation exceeded costs, including savings in government administration, economic benefits from re-establishing markets post-outbreak, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. The study found that implementing NAIS could result in economic benefits of $1.32 billion per year over a 10-year period, mainly due to lost export market access and increased consumer confidence in food products. However, some producers are concerned about potential liability for contamination after animals leave the farm. Documentation of management practices, including animal health programs, can help mitigate these concerns. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination after animals leave the farm. Documentation of management practices can help protect against liability and prove animal origins. There is also debate about public scrutiny of producer records under the Freedom of Information Act. Producers are concerned about public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Some worry about potential misuse of information by animal rights extremists or revealing proprietary information. FOIA exempts certain business information to protect providers. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the omnibus 2008 farm bill was deleted that would have required USDA regulations. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the omnibus 2008 farm bill was deleted that would have required USDA regulations addressing the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, while the EU mandates individual identification and traceability for all suppliers. Japan also has traceability measures in place. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, following the EU's individual identification and traceability rules for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef but has other specifications in place. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws to subject imported beef to the same traceability requirements as domestic beef. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for traceability requirements on imported beef, following their election victory in 2009. They seek to align imported beef with domestic beef standards but may not address this issue immediately due to other priorities. The DPJ aims to pass laws for traceability requirements on imported beef, but may not address it immediately due to other priorities. India is the only top-tier beef exporter without a traceability system. Beef traceability may become necessary for global trade in the future. Stuart emphasizes the increasing importance of beef traceability for global trade, as it may soon become a requirement. The WTO's rules on non-tariff trade barriers, like traceability, aim to ensure market access. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and not more stringent than necessary for health protection. The implementation of traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified based on health risk assessment and equivalent to domestic standards. The USDA has invested $142 million in the development of NAIS since 2004, but participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Substantial criticism of the national program was also noted. Despite a $142 million investment in NAIS since 2004, participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions to address concerns and assess the slow growth in participation rates. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The input received led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system announced on February 5, 2010. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system on February 5, 2010, following public feedback gathered during listening sessions. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009, with Congress expressing frustration over slow implementation relative to funding. The FY2009 USDA appropriation directed APHIS to make progress in implementing the NAIS program, with specific objectives outlined in the agency's 2008 traceability business plan. Despite a proposed increase in funding to $14.6 million for FY2010, the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill, despite a proposed increase to $14.6 million. Subcommittee chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow national sign-up for NAIS. The full committee's report noted APHIS's failure to implement an effective animal health system despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. The committee expressed frustration with the slow progress of national sign-up for NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 originally provided for the entire $14.6 million proposed by the Administration. An amendment to zero out Senate funding for NAIS failed to pass in committee in July. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 initially included $14.6 million for NAIS funding, but a successful amendment reduced it to $7.3 million for FY2010. The amendment specified that the funds could only be used for ongoing NAIS activities and rulemaking purposes. The amended bill was passed by the full Senate on August 4, 2009. The successful amendment restricted FY2010 funds for NAIS activities and rulemaking. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million. The Agriculture appropriations bill was signed into law as P.L. 111-80 on October 21, 2009. USDA claimed authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. The USDA claimed authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed but not adopted to clarify USDA's authority and establish a national ID system. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a national Livestock Identification Board and implement a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program. H.R. 3485 aimed to create new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat, poultry, and FDA-regulated foods. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a national Livestock Identification Board and implement a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program. The broader food traceability provisions of H.R. 814 and S. 425 include requirements for FSIS to establish a system that can trace each animal and carcass from slaughter through distribution to the consumer. The bills also authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to require record maintenance for traceability purposes. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to establish a national Livestock Identification Board and implement a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program. The provisions include requirements for FSIS to trace each animal and carcass from slaughter to the consumer, with the Secretary of Agriculture authorized to require record maintenance for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress held hearings on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to review animal identification systems and address animal health, disease, bio-security, and agro-terrorism concerns. The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology is reviewing the National Animal Identification System, which has a history dating back to the 1800s in the United States. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. In the 1940s, the USDA started a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis using official tags and ear tattoos. The system of tagging and identification has been phased out as brucellosis nears eradication in the United States. In the 1950s-1980s, there was a recognition of the importance of early detection of sick animals in disease outbreaks, leading to plans for a national animal identification system by USDA. In the 1980s, the USDA started planning for a national animal identification system. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first identified in the UK's cattle herds, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In the 1980s, BSE was first identified in the UK's cattle herds, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. Subsequent outbreaks of FMD in Taiwan and Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in significant economic losses and mass culling of pigs. In 2001, an outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands led to the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in economic losses. The following year, an outbreak of FMD in cattle in the United Kingdom resulted in the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing an estimated $7.9 billion. In 2003, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to draft an animal ID plan. In collaboration with various organizations, a draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) was published in December 2003, calling for recording the movement of individual animals in a central database. APHIS designed an ID numbering system and allocated numbers to premises such as farms, feedlots, and processing plants. The USAIP called for recording animal movement in a central database, with APHIS designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and for major species to be identified by July 2006. The first case of mad cow disease in the US was detected as the draft USAIP was published in December 2003. The USDA aimed to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004, with all major species identified by July 2006. Following the detection of mad cow disease in the US, Secretary Ann Veneman transferred funds for the accelerated implementation of a national animal ID system. In April 2004, Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million from CCC funds to APHIS for the National Animal Identification System. The program's framework was announced, periodically revised, and a Draft Strategic Plan was issued in May 2005 with a mandatory program timeline by January 2009. In August 2005, Draft Program Standards were announced, and in April 2006, Implementation Strategies were unveiled. The USDA issued a Draft Strategic Plan in May 2005 with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009. In August 2005, Draft Program Standards were announced, followed by Implementation Strategies in April 2006. The NAIS program initially aimed to transition from voluntary to mandatory participation. The NAIS program was initially designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory participation, but in November 2006, it was announced to be entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), outlining a three-step approach to implementation. The guide emphasized the program's voluntary nature and commitment to protecting individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the NAIS User Guide. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) user guide reassured livestock producers of the program's voluntary nature and commitment to protecting private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the NAIS User Guide, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. The Business Plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving a 48-hour traceback of affected animals in case of disease outbreaks. The Business Plan for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) outlined key strategies to achieve a 48-hour traceback of affected animals in case of disease outbreaks. It prioritized species into Tier 1 for primary commercial food animals and Tier 2 for other livestock and poultry. The goal was to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to achieve a 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. Livestock and poultry were categorized into Tier 1 for primary commercial food animals and Tier 2 for others. The goal was to enroll 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. In January 2009, a proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published for public comment until March 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather stakeholder input on NAIS. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). In April 2009, USDA released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced substantial revisions to USDA's approach for achieving national animal identification and traceability. In April 2009, USDA released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced substantial revisions to USDA's approach for achieving national animal identification and traceability. The new approach allows states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability, but animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. The USDA proposed a revision in March 2010 to require all animals moving in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 for feedback on the Animal Disease Traceability framework. APHIS released two documents in August 2010 outlining the proposed rule. APHIS released two documents on August 13 describing a proposed rule on traceability and the United States' participation in international animal ID and traceability organizations. The United States participates in international organizations such as the CODEX alimentarius, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock and animal products. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. As a member of the WTO, the U.S. agrees to international trade rules for harmonizing participation in commerce and dispute settlement. The United States, as a member of the WTO, follows international trade rules for harmonizing commerce and dispute settlement. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE provide guidelines for food safety and animal health standards, not international laws. The WTO addresses concerns about non-tariff trade barriers affecting market access. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, created in 1963, provides guidelines for food safety standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963 by the FAO and WHO, develops food standards and guidelines to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade practices, and coordinate international food standards work. The Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program aims to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade practices, and coordinate international food standards work. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is responsible for improving animal health worldwide and setting standards for animal identification and traceability. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization focused on improving animal health globally through setting standards for animal identification and traceability. They help member countries implement systems to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The guidelines include general principles and guidance on system design and implementation. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, which became official standards in 2007. In April 2008, the Director General of the OIE called for the global implementation of animal identification and product traceability systems from \"farm to fork.\" These systems, based on OIE standards, would allow compartmentalization and regionalization of disease outbreaks, enabling trade to continue for animal products from unaffected areas. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on compartmentalization to manage disease outbreaks effectively. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes guidelines on compartmentalization and regionalization of disease outbreaks to facilitate trade for unaffected areas. Export certification, managed by USDA's FSIS, is essential for meeting importing countries' beef requirements. Export certification for beef is crucial for meeting importing countries' requirements. Certification ensures compliance with veterinary, animal health, and sanitary standards through plant inspection and sanitary sampling. The OIE works towards harmonizing international certification standards and promoting transparency and reliance on scientific information. The OIE contributes to harmonization of international certification standards through plant inspection and sanitary sampling. Many countries have adopted national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities. Many international trading partners and competitors have national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities, including Canada's Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) which manages and administers the national individual identification system for the Canadian cattle and bison industry. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) is responsible for Canada's national individual identification, tracking, and trace-back system for the cattle and bison industry. The CCIA is overseen by a board of directors representing various sectors of the Canadian livestock industry, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as a non-voting member. Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) collaborates with the CCIA to meet funding requirements for development and enhancement initiatives. Animal identification for Canadian cattle transitioned from a voluntary to a mandatory program in 2002. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned to a mandatory animal identification program in 2002, moving from traditional ear tags to RFID technology for tagging cattle leaving their farm of origin since 2006. RFID tags offer benefits such as exceptional tag retention, increased data integrity, and the ability to read at a distance. Since 2006, all cattle leaving their farm of origin in Canada must have a CCIA-approved RFID tag for tracking purposes. The compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was estimated to be between 99-100% in March 2009. Personal information associated with the ear tag number is securely stored in a national database and only accessed by authorized personnel when needed. The Canadian cattle ID compliance rate is 99-100%. Personal information linked to ear tag numbers is securely stored in the national database. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) manages ID and traceback systems for various industry groups. Sheep and hog ID programs became mandatory in 2004 and 2008. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is their tracking system. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a permanent whole-of-life system for tracking livestock from birth to slaughter. It is mandatory for cattle since 2005 and operational for sheep and goats since 2009. Similar systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. Australia implemented a National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in the early 1960s to eradicate diseases like bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. The system includes Property Identification Codes (PICs) for cattle since 1967, allowing for traceability from birth to slaughter. In 1967, Australia started a system for cattle with Property Identification Codes (PICs) to trace herds back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the system was converted to electronic using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs) for whole-of-life individual cattle identification to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. In 1998, individual cattle identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market with Hormone Growth Promotant-free meat. The NLIS was introduced in 1999 to trace animals to their property of origin within 24 hours. By 2004, all NLIS-identified animals were successfully traced, compared to only 41% of cattle without NLIS tags. In 2004, the NLIS ensured all identified animals were traced to their origin within 24 hours. By 2005, mandatory cattle identification was expanded to all leaving their birth property, with tracking at transfer points. Each animal at slaughter receives a unique ID linked to barcodes for traceability to carcasses and byproducts. At slaughter in Australia, each animal is assigned a unique ID number linked to barcodes for traceability. However, individual animal information is generally not available as animals are grouped into lots by harvest date and time. The NLIS is a partnership between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government playing a coordination role and providing funding. The NLIS in Australia is a partnership between the Federal government and industry, with the government providing funding and playing a coordination role. State governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health, working with industry to develop legislation for the animal identification program. This includes extension programs and producer education initiatives. The animal identification program in Australia is managed by joint committees at the state level, coordinating extension programs and producer education. State governments oversee the registry of PICs, order identification devices, and monitor compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS. Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection from Australian Freedom of Information (FOI) laws. The European Union (EU) also mandates animal identification as part of its food safety programs for major commercial animal species. The European Union (EU) mandates animal identification for food safety programs, with species-specific ID systems in place for major commercial animals. These systems aim to localize and trace animals for veterinary purposes and control infectious diseases, evolving in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and the BSE crisis. The Council of the European Union implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals in 1997, requiring double ear tags for traceability from birth to death by January 1, 2000. The European Union mandated permanent identification of individual bovine animals by January 1, 2000, using double ear tags for traceability from birth to death. A national database records movements and ID information, with regulations fully implemented on July 17, 2000. The EU regulations require mandatory food traceability, including ID and tracking information for bovine animals from birth to harvest. Meat products must be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state where the meat was processed, and the approval number of the facility. This system has been in place since July 17, 2000, and is compulsory for all equidae since January 1, 2005. Since January 1, 2005, the EU has mandated food traceability, including ID systems for equidae, porcine, ovine, and caprine animals. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004. The EU implemented an ID system for ovine and caprine animals in July 2005, while Japan has had a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004. Imported beef in Japan is not currently subject to the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef, but there is growing political pressure for this to change. In response to food safety crises in the early 2000s, Japan implemented animal traceability regulations and oversight, starting with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures in July 2002. This included bovine animal traceability laws requiring domestically produced beef to be traced from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. Political pressure is increasing for imported beef in Japan to meet the same traceability standards as domestic beef. In July 2002, Japan enacted the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures, implementing bovine animal traceability laws. By December 1, 2003, domestically produced beef had to be traced from farms to slaughterhouses. Subsequently, the Food Safety Basic Law was passed in May 2003, establishing the Food Safety Commission. The Beef Traceability Law in June 2003 extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. The Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures in Japan required traceability to be extended to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries announced a Japan Agricultural Standard program for certifying the traceability of imported beef. Exporters must provide detailed information to gain certification. The Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures in Japan requires traceability to be extended to processors, distributors, and retailers. Japanese retailers and restaurants display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, requiring individual identification and registration in a central database system. The Beef Traceability System (BTS) in South Korea, initiated in 2004 as voluntary, became mandatory for domestically produced beef in 2009. It requires individual identification and registration in a central database system, tracking each animal from birth to consumer. Consumers can access animal-specific information like sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's details, feed, medications, slaughter date, inspection date, and processing location. The South Korean government plans to implement traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a fully operational national animal ID system, but efforts were made in 2004 to improve animal traceability through the establishment of the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG). New Zealand lacks a fully functioning national animal ID system. Efforts were made in 2004 to improve animal traceability through the establishment of the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG). In 2006, the Animal Identification and Traceability Governance Group (AITGG) was formed to oversee the development of a new system called NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing). However, as of early 2009, NAIT is still more of a project under development than a fully functioning system. NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing) is still in development as of early 2009, focusing on traceability for cattle and deer populations in New Zealand. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has stated that other species will only be considered once the system is operational for cattle and deer. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has stated that other species will only be considered for addition to the NAIT system once it is fully operational for cattle and deer. New Zealand's existing animal ID systems, MINDA and NBTIP, were established under the Bio-security Act of 1993. MINDA, a voluntary herd management system, has high dairy herd participation in New Zealand. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011, in addition to existing voluntary systems like MINDA and NBTIP in New Zealand. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil, known as the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV). This system was initially intended as a mandatory program for identification at the farm level but has since been extended to include the entire beef chain. The Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV, now ERAS) was initially a mandatory program for individual animal identification at the farm level in Brazil. It was later extended to include the entire beef chain, but due to low demand in the domestic market, it remains a voluntary program focused on providing animals to slaughterhouses for foreign markets requiring origination information. SISBOV is a voluntary program in Brazil focused on providing animals to slaughterhouses for foreign markets, particularly the EU. Animal classification is done by group lot instead of individual animals, with individual tags accepted by the EU for each group sold to export slaughterhouses. EU audits of SISBOV have been conducted since 2003. The EU has concerns about Brazil's animal identification and traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports in 2008. Audits by the EU have found severe shortcomings in the system, with a lack of robust information being a major issue. The EU has concerns about Brazil's animal identification and traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports in 2008. A report released in 2009 suggests the situation in Brazil is worsening, with Europe worried about a lack of robust information and the potential risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU from Brazil. Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability in 2003, aimed at animal products destined for the EU. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for products bound for the EU, including farm-of-origin details and cattle movement permits. The system focuses on identifying cattle for export markets, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The program aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, but full tagging of the Argentine beef herd is not expected until 2017. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for products bound for the EU, focusing on identifying cattle for export markets. Official ID tagging has been required for all calves born after September 2007 to facilitate tracking cattle from birth to slaughter. Argentina's beef exports to the United States are restricted to thermo-processed beef due to disease control issues, particularly foot and mouth disease. This limitation incentivizes Argentina to improve its animal identification and traceability system. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for products bound for the EU, focusing on identifying cattle for export markets. This limitation incentivizes Argentina to improve its animal identification and traceability system. Uruguay is very dependent on external markets for selling a large portion of its annual domestic production, with 68% of its beef production sold in foreign markets during the 2004-2008 period. Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information as demanded by foreign buyers, and only since late 2006 has been able to institute a comprehensive national program. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system in late 2006 called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG). Under SNIG, all cattle must be tagged with two tags before six months of age or before being transported from their property of birth. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) requires all cattle to be identified with two tags before six months of age or before leaving their birth property. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) mandates all cattle to be identified with two tags before six months of age or before leaving their birth property. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010. SNIG requires traceability to be extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG builds on Uruguay's national premises identification system (DICOSE) established in 1973. Private individuals or companies registered within SNIG must be used for movement notification, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. The SNIG database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. Currently, SNIG does not mandate further traceability to consumers, although this is under consideration. The SNIG database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. Uruguay's government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift this expense to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs due to various reasons. Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs, such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for the absence of these programs include technological limitations, lack of national distribution chains for animal products, and financial constraints of consumers in poorer countries. In many poorer countries, consumers are unable to be discriminating in their choice of animal products due to financial constraints. Lower-income consumers are not willing to pay a premium for food that is identified and traceable."
