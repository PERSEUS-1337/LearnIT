    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The overall DHS budget for FY2013 is estimated to be $681 million lower than FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 billion for DHS in FY2013, which is below the budget estimate. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 billion for DHS in FY2013, excluding $254 million for overseas operations and $5,481 million for disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 with amendments resulted in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013. Funding for DHS activities was 27% below the requested level due to several floor amendments using management accounts as offsets. Increases were proposed for Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue Response activities, and grant programs. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, a continuing resolution allowing the federal government to operate through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. It passed the House by a vote of 329-91 on September 13, 2012, and the Senate by a vote of 62-30 on September 22, 2012. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, allowed the Department of Homeland Security $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. After sequestration, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Data for FY2012 amounts are from the President's Budget Documents. Budget authority from P.L. 113-6 was available for DHS to use after sequestration, as per the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Data for FY2012 amounts are from the President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, and S.Rept. 112-169. Information on the FY2013 request is from the President's Budget Documents, FY2013 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and FY2013 DHS Budget in Brief. Information on the House-passed FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill is from H.R. 5855 and H.Rept. 112-492, while information on the Senate-reported version is from S. 2316 and S.Rept. 112-169. The FY2013 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, FY2013 DHS Budget in Brief, House-passed FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill (H.R. 5855, H.Rept. 112-492), Senate-reported version (S. 2316, S.Rept. 112-169), continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 117), final resolution of FY2013 appropriations (P.L. 113-6, Senate explanatory statement), and post-sequester funding levels (U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan) are sources of information for historical funding data. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Funding levels are based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data is from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents. Amounts in the report are in budget authority and rounded to the nearest million. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and departments within the agency. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 contains appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Coast Guard (USCG), and Secret Service. Title III includes appropriations for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Title IV includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Science and Technology. Title III of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes appropriations for the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Title IV includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). Title V contains general provisions providing congressional direction to the department, with additional titles added as needed for special issues. The structure of appropriations bills for the Department of Homeland Security may not be symmetrical between House and Senate versions. Additional titles can be added to address special issues, such as emergency appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. Differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is a general practice for DHS. The FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of Homeland Security had some differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among the appropriations committees. These amounts are known as the 302(a) allocations and include discretionary totals available. In the budget process, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. These amounts are then allocated among the appropriations committees as 302(a) allocations. The appropriations committees further allocate these funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary totals. In the budget process, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary totals and are adjusted as needed during the year. The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first affected by these adjustments. The Appropriations Committee can adjust 302(b) allocations during the year by issuing a report with revised suballocations as appropriations bills progress. The Budget Control Act (BCA) affected FY2012 appropriations bills by setting discretionary spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending. For FY2013, the Budget Control Act set a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending, which includes the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, international affairs programs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Intelligence Community Management Account. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. The Budget Control Act set separate caps for security and other spending in FY2013. Security spending was capped at $686 billion, while other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other specific purposes. The Budget Control Act established spending caps for security and other spending in FY2013. The Act also created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a deficit reduction plan, which, if not enacted, would trigger automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending caps for security and other spending in FY2013. If deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by a certain date, automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps would be triggered. The sequestration process required the Office of Management and Budget to implement across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending caps for security and other spending in FY2013, triggering automatic spending reductions through sequestration if deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by a certain date. The sequestration process required equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made changes to the procedures in the BCA for FY2013, delaying the implementation of the joint committee sequester until March 1, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) for FY2013. It delayed the joint committee sequester until March 1, 2013, reduced the sequester amount by $24 billion, and lowered the statutory caps on discretionary spending. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with budget authority canceled for non-exempt funds. President Obama ordered the joint committee sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, as per the Budget Control Act (BCA) amended by ATRA. The OMB report specified the budget authority to be canceled for non-exempt funds at the program, project, and activity (PPA) level within each account. Sequestration was applied while a temporary continuing resolution was in effect, resulting in reductions calculated on an annualized basis and apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers in the FY2013 DHS operating plan were used for this report. The reductions under the joint committee sequester were calculated annually and apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are based on the FY2013 DHS operating plan, which only includes resources from P.L. 113-6. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate any excess budget authority beyond FY2013 discretionary spending limits. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 aims to reduce budget authority exceeding FY2013 limits. DHS faces a 0.1% across-the-board cut in the \"security\" category for disaster relief. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes two across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and faces a 0.1% cut. The Office of Management and Budget will determine if spending limits have been exceeded. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 mandates across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority to comply with FY2013 spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget determines if limits are exceeded, with additional rescissions required to avoid surpassing the limits. OMB calculated additional cuts of 0.032% for \"security\" budget authority (applicable to DHS) and 0.2% for \"nonsecurity\" budget authority post-enactment of P.L. 113-6. OMB calculated additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority following the enactment of P.L. 113-6. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are exempt from these cuts. Tables in the report include CRS calculations of the impact of these across-the-board cuts. Table 2 displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, FY2012, and the President's request are outlined in Table 2. Adjustments to discretionary budget authority caps under the Budget Control Act have been influenced by three justifications. Emergency spending and overseas contingency operations are not limited, with no adjustments made for emergencies in FY2012 for DHS. The caps on discretionary budget authority have influenced DHS's appropriations process. Emergency spending and overseas contingency operations are not limited, with no adjustments made for emergencies in FY2012 for DHS. $258 million was provided for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations under P.L. 112-331. Disaster relief is limited, with the allowable adjustment determined by OMB using a specific formula based on past spending trends. The Office of Management and Budget determines disaster relief funding using a formula based on past spending trends. For FY2013, the allowable adjustment for disaster relief was $11,779 million, fully exercised including $6,400 million from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund. The FY2013 disaster relief funding was $11,779 million, fully utilized with $6,400 million from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees in FY2013. The House rejected the pay raise, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding a pay raise for civilian federal employees in FY2013, but neither the continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. The breakdown of the DHS bill by title does not offer transparency into where DHS's appropriated resources are allocated. DHS's discretionary budget authority for FY2013 varies widely among its components. Table 4 and Figure 1 display DHS's pre-sequester budget broken down by component. DHS's budget for FY 2013 is broken down by component in Table 4 and Figure 1, showing the varying sizes of their appropriations. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations, while Table 4 reflects rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25) impacts the discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6, with adjustments under the BCA including resources for DHS in P.L. 113-2. The budget allocation for the bill includes resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the BCA, including additional resources for DHS in P.L. 113-2. It is important to note that DHS components receive funding from sources other than discretionary appropriations, such as fee income or offsetting collections. The DHS budget includes resources beyond discretionary appropriations, with components like TSA and CIS relying on fee income. Less than 4% of CIS's budget comes from direct appropriations. Figure 2 shows the comparison between the Administration's FY2013 budget request and the enacted budget, highlighting non-discretionary funding sources. Figure 2 compares the Administration's FY2013 budget request with the enacted budget for FY2013, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations, adjustments under the Budget Control Act, and non-appropriated resources for DHS. The graphic includes funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Some amounts are from the Administration's budget request documents. The FY2013 enacted funding for DHS includes funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars without adjustments for inflation or sequestration. The amounts shown represent enacted amounts at the start of the next fiscal year's appropriation cycle. The appropriations for DHS from FY2003 to FY2013 are presented in current dollars without adjustments for inflation or sequestration. The House Appropriations Committee's markup of H.R. 5855 in May 2012 was one of the earliest in history for the DHS appropriations bill. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up the DHS appropriations bills in May 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for the department. Figure 3 illustrates the history of the timing of DHS appropriations bills through the legislative process. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up the DHS appropriations bills in May 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for the department. Title I of the DHS appropriations bill provides funding for the department's management activities, Analysis and Operations (A&O) account, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The Administration requested $1,279 million for these accounts in FY2013, an increase of $147 million above the enacted level. The House-passed bill would have provided $1,020 million, a decrease of 20.2% from the requested level and 9.9% below FY2012. The Senate-reported bill would have. The Administration requested $1,279 million for DHS accounts in FY2013, an increase of $147 million from the enacted level. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, a 20.2% decrease from the request. The Senate-reported bill suggested $1,102 million, 13.8% below the request. After cuts, the final appropriations were $1,086 million, 15.1% lower than requested. Sequestration further reduced it to $1,026 million for FY2013. The act provides $1,086 million in appropriations for Title I, a decrease of 15.1% from the requested level and 4.1% below FY2012. Sequestration reduced this to $1,026 million for FY2013. Table 6 lists the enacted amounts for the individual components of Title I for FY2012 and FY2013, along with post-sequester levels reported by DHS. The Administration's request for components for FY2013, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, enacted level in P.L. 113-6, and post-sequester level of available resources from P.L. 113-6 reported by DHS. Departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including OSEM, USM, OCAO, OCHCO, OCPO, and OCSO. The Administration has requested funding for the consolidation of its headquarters and various components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including the Under Secretary for Management and its offices. A graphic representation of the discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS is provided in each section of the report. The Administration has requested funding for the consolidation of DHS headquarters and its components. A graphic representation shows the discretionary appropriations for each element, comparing FY2013 request to FY2012 enacted appropriations. The FY2013 budget request for departmental management activities in Title I included increases for OSEM, OCFO, and OCIO, while USM saw a decrease. The total request was $724 million, excluding funds for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for three offices. Two program changes funded through this request were for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), with program changes including funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman for training programs and policy advice related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), with program changes including funding for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management, OCHCO, and USM for various purposes such as salaries, expenses, human resources, and improvements to the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The Administration requested $55 million for the OCFO, including $6.7 million for the Financial Systems Modernization effort to implement a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013. This new system is necessary to accurately account for, track, and report on FEMA resources. The Administration requested $313 million for the OCIO to implement a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013. Within the OCIO account, Infrastructure and Security Activities requested $122 million, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding reductions compared to the President's request for various departments, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The total funding recommended was lower than what was requested. The House Appropriations committee recommended funding reductions for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO compared to the President's request. The total funding for management activities was $627 million, a decrease of $97 million or 13.4% from the request. These reductions were justified by the committee to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals. The House Appropriations committee recommended funding reductions for management activities, excluding the DHS Headquarters project. These reductions were justified to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. During floor consideration of the bill, amendments were passed to further reduce the budget for management by almost $33 million. During the bill's consideration, amendments were passed to reduce the management budget by nearly $33 million. The largest amendments included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and reallocating them to the Federal Emergency Management Agency programs. During the bill's consideration, amendments were passed to reduce the management budget by $33 million. This included reducing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and reallocating them to various programs such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency State and Local Programs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, and Firefighter Assistance Grants. The House passed amendments to reduce the management budget by $33 million, reallocating funds to programs like Federal Emergency Management Agency State and Local Programs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, and Firefighter Assistance Grants. Additional amendments aimed to cut $10 million from the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. This would have left the USM with $41 million less than the requested level. Within OSEM, $45,000 was recommended for reception and representation expenses, with $17,000 allocated for international programs related to the visa waiver program. The House passed amendments to reduce the management budget by $33 million, reallocating funds to programs like Federal Emergency Management Agency State and Local Programs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, and Firefighter Assistance Grants. An amendment by Representative Flake redirected $17,000 from international programs to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000. OSEM faced provisions withholding $71 million until required reports were submitted. The House passed an amendment withholding $71 million from OSEM until required reports were submitted. A provision proposed to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft until key reports were submitted, with an additional $5 million in funding proposed. The House passed an amendment withholding $71 million from OSEM until required reports were submitted. A provision proposed to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by key officials until two reports were submitted, with an additional $5 million in funding proposed. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million (10%) from the requested level for OCPO for \"failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit on time a comprehensive acquisition report with quarterly updates.\" Under the OCFO account, more than $29 million would have been withheld from obligation until the Committee received all reports and plans that were, by statute, required to be submitted with or in conjunction with the FY2014 budget request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million (10%) from the requested level for OCPO for failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit a comprehensive acquisition report with quarterly updates. The report emphasized direct communication from relevant components on their areas of responsibility. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $242 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. Additionally, $27 million was allocated for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $242 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. The House report supported the migration of component resources to the Department's two consolidated data centers but did not provide the proposed $65 million for the migration due to significant shortfalls in the President's budget request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed funding of $655 million for departmental management, with decreases in appropriations compared to the President's request. The Office of the Chief Information Officer would receive $248 million, which is $65 million less than requested. The Senate committee proposed a funding of $655 million for departmental management, which is a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties would receive an increase of $1,327,000 to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes and constitutional requirements.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties would receive an increase of $1,327,000 to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes and constitutional requirements. However, the committee noted a decrease in funding for the office compared to FY2012 levels and urged the Secretary to reinstate funding for the historian position. The committee report recommended reinstating funding for the historian position at DHS and reducing reception and representation expenses due to budget constraints. The report also emphasized the need for oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures at DHS to limit waste and abuse. The OCHCO was allocated $35 million, $1 million below the request, due to budget constraints. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding cuts for the OCHCO and OCIO at DHS to focus resources on critical missions. The OCHCO was allocated $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in salaries and expenses. The OCIO would receive $248 million, including $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding cuts for the OCHCO and OCIO at DHS to focus resources on critical missions. The OCIO would receive $248 million, including $127 million for technology investments through FY2015, with $65 million allocated for data center migration. The committee report highlighted that data center consolidation investment is expected to result in savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030. The committee report noted that investment in data center consolidation is expected to result in savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with funding reductions compared to the President's request. The total funding for departmental management in Title I is $643 million, a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. The law provides $643 million for departmental management in Title I, a $170 million or 21% decrease from the President's request. Only OCIO faced funding reduction due to sequestration, calculated against the part-year appropriation under P.L. 112-175. 2 USC 903 allows for a crediting mechanism to reduce sequestration for activities with final FY2013 appropriations below OMB's baseline. See Table 7 for more funding details. The law allows for a crediting mechanism under 2 USC 903 to reduce sequestration for activities with final FY2013 appropriations below OMB's baseline. P.L. 113-6 directs the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT acquisition projects funded under the CIO or by multiple components. The Senate's explanatory statement also directs the Secretary to provide additional information. The Senate directs the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT acquisition projects funded under the CIO or by multiple components. The Secretary is also directed to provide a report on travel costs and submit a contingency plan for user fee collections. DHS appropriations require the Secretary to submit a contingency plan for user fee collections and a revised plan within 90 days of enactment. The USM must provide a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with the President's FY2014 budget proposal and quarterly updates thereafter. DHS is to report on the implementation of the balanced workforce strategy. DHS is required to submit quarterly updates on the implementation of the balanced workforce strategy and provide a detailed report to the appropriations committees. The CFO will continue to provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, with funding numbers reflecting spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts. The CFO will provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts, with funding levels outlined in Table 7. Funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 show spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, but do not include the impact of sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column reflects budgetary resources after sequestration as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration effects. The department's budget proposal included various issues such as separate line items under OSEM, new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans, and conference spending. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices - OIA, SLLE, and PSO, currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to OSEM was rejected during the legislative process. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices - OIA, SLLE, and PSO, currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to OSEM was rejected during the legislative process, including P.L. 113-6. The House committee noted that none of the offices are headed by individuals who are Senate-confirmed and directed the Department to report on the potential of establishing an external affairs office. The House committee report directs the Department to consider establishing an external affairs office to consolidate and streamline various functions currently handled by separate offices within DHS. The Senate committee noted that DHS has not provided a compelling rationale for these offices to remain as standalone entities. The Senate committee report criticized DHS for not providing a compelling rationale for maintaining separate offices within the Department, suggesting that these functions could be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. Additionally, the Administration's budget proposed three legislative measures to increase DHS's budget resources, including an increase in the aviation security fee, authorization for the use of customs fee revenues, and the ability for CBP to enter into reimbursement agreements for customs services. The House rejected these proposals, while the Senate included all three. The House rejected proposals for increasing the aviation security fee, using customs fee revenues, and allowing CBP to enter reimbursement agreements. The Senate included all three proposals, with concerns about a potential $115 million shortfall in the DHS budget due to the new aviation security fee increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $115 million shortfall in the DHS budget due to the new aviation security fee increase, which the Committee rejects as unrealistic budgeting. This may lead to additional reductions in Department requests. The Committee rejects unrealistic budgeting and drastic measures to offset unnecessary gaps in the DHS budget. Consequences include additional reductions in Department requests. The Committee will consider proposals when drafting legislation, but until then, they will not be relevant to appropriations work. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to initiate pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The Department has been late in responding to Congressional requests. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts due to the Department's failure to comply with statutory requirements. The Department's tardiness in responding to Congressional direction is deemed unacceptable, hindering oversight work essential for DHS to protect the American people effectively and uphold fiscal responsibility standards. The Committee's investment and expenditure plans are crucial for DHS oversight, but they have been consistently late or incomplete, hindering the Department's ability to align program priorities with resources. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for submitting expenditure reports on time. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all required reports are submitted promptly. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all statutorily required expenditure reports are submitted on time. House floor action reduced the USM budget, resulting in 70% of the budget being withheld if provisions were to become law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. House floor action reduced the USM budget significantly, with 70% of the budget being withheld if provisions were to become law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. The House committee report emphasizes the need for better oversight of expenditures and requires the Office of Inspector General to assess the Department's compliance with Federal laws.

Sequestration reduced the budget to $306 million, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and vague authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted these issues during a House hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The House hearing focused on DHS's intelligence mission, as highlighted by the Aspen Institute report, which recommended avoiding duplication of efforts and focusing on specific homeward-focused areas. The Aspen Institute report recommends that DHS's intelligence mission should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, not duplicated by other agencies. This includes areas not served by other federal agencies, especially state and local partners. The mission direction for DHS should prioritize areas not served by other agencies, particularly state/local partners. Concerns about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other federal agencies have been highlighted.

Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by $575 million. Various policy issues were raised during the appropriations cycle, including concerns about US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. During the appropriations cycle, Congress mandated an automated entry and exit data system for foreign visitors to the U.S. The system tracks arrivals, departures, and verifies identities by collecting biographic information. The entry-exit system, mandated by Congress, tracks foreign visitors' arrivals and departures to the U.S. It collects and stores biographic and biometric identification information in databases shared with various government agencies. The DHS's Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) and Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) store data for identifying potential risks to the United States. Biometric data is required for most non-citizens entering or re-entering the country through air, seaports, and land ports. The system does not collect biometric data from non-citizens exiting. The DHS's Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) and Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) require biometric data for most non-citizens entering the US through air, seaports, and land ports. However, biometric data is not collected from non-citizens exiting the country. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system. DHS focuses on an enhanced biographic exit program and an integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. Air and sea carriers provide passenger manifest data to DHS for checks against entry records and databases to identify overstays. High-priority overstays are flagged for investigations. Citizenship and Immigration Canada is part of the integrated U.S.-Canadian system. Some Members of Congress are frustrated by the lack of implementation of a biometric exit system. DHS receives biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada from Citizenship and Immigration Canada for U.S. entry-exit system purposes. The U.S. entry-exit system, previously known as the US-VISIT Program, has faced challenges in implementing a biometric exit system. Changes in the system's organizational structure have occurred since its creation in 2003. Members of Congress have urged DHS to provide plans for a more comprehensive exit system. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program was established in 2003 under DHS' Directorate of Border and Transportation Security. It underwent reorganization by former DHS Secretary Chertoff, leading to its placement within a proposed Screening Coordination Office (SCO). However, funding for the SCO was not allocated, and US-VISIT became a standalone office within the DHS appropriation in FY2006. In FY2008, US-VISIT was transferred to the new National. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program, established in 2003 under DHS, was reorganized under a proposed Screening Coordination Office (SCO) that never received funding. US-VISIT became a standalone office in FY2006 and was later transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate in FY2008. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies, but the move was not fully supported by Congress. The House-passed bill proposed transferring $73 million to CBP and ICE for entry-exit policy and overstay analysis, while leaving $191 million of US-VISIT funding in a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Senate-reported bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation within CBP. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) within NPPD. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, with questions raised about how DHS sets staffing levels. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets them. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS maintains high staffing levels during budget tightening, while the House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs. The House report raised concerns about stagnant inspection fees limiting funds for CBP officer salaries and recommended changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, managing staffing surges, exploring partnerships, expanding trusted programs, and utilizing technology for officer efficiency. It also called for a specific staffing and deployment plan for border patrol agents. The House report recommended changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, managing staffing surges, exploring partnerships, expanding trusted programs, and utilizing technology for officer efficiency. The Senate report requested a plan for OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. CBP officer salaries are funded by user fees, and efforts are being made to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues. Some Members may disagree with efforts to reduce CBP staffing. The report language directs CBP to refine its model for forecasting user fee revenues to ensure adequate funds for salaries. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly, but OFO staffing at POEs has only increased slightly despite expanded responsibilities. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to illegal migrants and drug smugglers entering through POEs. Increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to concerns that illegal migrants and drug smugglers are entering through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing argue that officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions more effectively than automated systems and technology. Sequestration in 2013 resulted in warnings of furloughs for DHS officials. With sequestration in 2013, DHS officials warned of furloughs for frontline CBP personnel, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring. The impact included cuts to over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 CBP officers, with measures taken to minimize the effects on frontline operations. DHS plans to reduce the impact of sequester on frontline operations by cutting employee performance awards, outside contracts, and administrative expenditures. CBP aims to avoid employee furloughs through overtime reductions and hiring freezes, but with a significant portion of the budget allocated to salaries and benefits, some cuts are inevitable. CBP plans to reduce overtime and implement hiring freezes to avoid employee furloughs. The administration is considering public-private partnerships for funding staffing and infrastructure at ports of entry, despite legal restrictions. The administration is exploring public-private partnerships to fund staffing and infrastructure at ports of entry, despite legal restrictions. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to fund additional services at ports of entry. These partnerships may involve reimbursing CBP for services, including officer overtime, new facilities, and expanding services at land ports of entry. CBP collects various user fees, known as COBRA fees, from passengers, cargo carriers, and importers for customs services. User fees, including COBRA fees, are collected from passengers, cargo carriers, and importers to fund customs services. These fees reimburse CBP for various functions such as overtime compensation, benefits, and officer salaries under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Certain COBRA fees, including merchandise processing fees, are collected to fund customs functions such as overtime compensation, benefits, premium pay, and officer salaries. Some fees are deposited in the Customs User Fee Account for additional revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. Congressional interest has been sparked by instances where passenger fees were collected without corresponding appropriations for customs services. Certain COBRA passenger fees have been collected and deposited in the Customs User Fee Account without a corresponding appropriation to pay for customs functions. Congressional interest was drawn by two recent examples of this, including the temporary fee increase under the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993, which resulted in the collection of about $639 million from FY1994-FY1997. Passenger fees from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands were temporarily increased, resulting in the collection of $639 million from FY1994-FY1997. The United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 eliminated fee exemptions for certain countries, leading to an estimated increase in COBRA fees of $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 onwards. Funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account without a corresponding appropriation for customs functions. The COBRA fees increased by $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 onwards due to the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011. The funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account without a specific appropriation for customs functions, raising questions about their use. The House Appropriations Committee requested CBP to report on the Department's access to the $639 million collected from passenger fees in previous years. Some Members of Congress have questioned the disposition of fees collected by CBP. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on access to $639 million identified by GAO. CBP's budget for FY2013 included fees in its budget, but there was a shortfall as the funds were not made available to CBP. The budget justification for FY2013 included fees for CBP officer salaries and expenses, but there was a shortfall as the funds were not made available to CBP. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to officer salaries and relying on increasing fee revenues to fill the gap, while the Senate awaited a resolution from the department. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million to address the budget shortfall in CBP salaries and directed CBP and OMB to include access to COBRA fees with appropriate offsets. The Senate report awaited a resolution for the budget shortfall in CBP salaries. P.L. 113-6 allocated an extra $110 million to address the shortfall and directed CBP and OMB to include access to COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS' strategy for controlling the Southwest Border involves using technology to monitor and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors for surveillance along key stretches of the border. Previous initiatives like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, emphasizing the rapid deployment of existing technology for border surveillance. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for not procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment under the Arizona Border Technology Plan. They expressed concerns about the premature call for proposals to use SBI net technology in certain areas of the Arizona border. Both chambers recommended fully funding border surveillance technologies. The Senate and House reports criticized DHS for the premature call for SBI net technology proposals in Arizona. Both chambers recommended fully funding border surveillance technologies, with the House calling for $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate calling for $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 includes $73,232,000 in rescissions from the BSFIT account. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance activities, including funding for the \"Big Pipe\" project. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. The Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) is involved in drug interdiction and border surveillance activities. They received $3 million for the \"Big Pipe\" project to transmit real-time video data. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012, projected 65,000 hours in FY2013, and operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS). UAS accounted for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance. In FY2012, the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS), with two on the Northern border, five on the Southwest border, and three in the Gulf of Mexico. UAS accounted for 5,737 flight hours, up from 4,406 hours in FY2011. Some Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance, including UAS. However, concerns exist about privacy threats and cost effectiveness of UAS in border security. A May 2012 DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for inadequate planning and support resources, potentially leading to under-utilization of UAS assets. The DHS Inspector General report in May 2012 criticized CBP's unmanned aircraft systems program for inadequate planning and support resources, potentially leading to under-utilization of UAS assets. Both appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget, with the House recommending an increase of $82,700,000 and the Senate recommending an increase of $70,997,000 for upgrading the OAM fleet, increasing flight hours, and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Interdiction. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. The funding increase was targeted towards upgrading the OAM fleet, increasing flight hours, and supporting UAS operations. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. Legislation directs CBP to restore overall and UAS flight hours to 2011 levels. Maritime cargo must be scanned through radiation detection and inspection scanners before being loaded on ships bound for the United States. The 9/11 Act established a deadline for DHS to exclude cargo that has not been scanned by July 1, 2012. The 9/11 Act set a deadline for DHS to exclude cargo not scanned by July 1, 2012, before being loaded on ships bound for the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline, raising questions about balancing security benefits against costs. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline, sparking debate on balancing security benefits with costs. Suggestions include focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and optimize resources. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System for security screening of incoming goods and travelers. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System for security screening of incoming goods and travelers. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported the President's request for these programs, acknowledging DHS' concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports.

They also develop intelligence to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws against smuggling, fraud, forced labor, trade agreement noncompliance, and vehicle and cargo theft. Funding numbers for ICE reflect spending cuts relative to previous years. The funding for ICE in FY2013 saw a decrease of $218 million (3.9%) from the previous year, with the Administration requesting $5,332 million in net budget authority. This reflects across-the-board spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, but does not include additional cuts required by sequestration. The Administration requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million (3.7%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. The budget request included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel and operations consolidation, and video conferencing expansion in detention facilities. Increase of $40 million for expanding the Alternatives to Detention program, $6 million for ICE personnel and operations consolidation, $7 million for video conferencing expansion in detention facilities and EOIR courtrooms, $18 million to transfer US-VISIT Program overstay analysis function to ICE, reductions of $17 million for the 287(g) program, $5 million for OPLA, $53 million for detention beds, and $41 million for Secure. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided ICE with a total funding authority of $5,786 million, representing a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from the FY2012 enacted level. This included reductions in funding for various programs such as the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. ICE's funding for FY2013 saw a decrease of $77 million (1.4%) from the FY2012 enacted level and an increase of $142 million (2.7%) over the Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total funding authority of $5,786 million, a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5,330 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $2 million (less than 0.1%) from the Administration's request and a decrease of $220 million (4.0%) from FY2012. ICE's funding for FY2013 was recommended to be $5,330 million, a decrease of $2 million from the Administration's request and $220 million from the FY2012 enacted amount. Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a gross funding authority of $5,642 million, a decrease of $2 million from the Administration's request and $220 million from the FY2012 enacted level. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from last year's appropriation and an increase of $94 million (1.8%) from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget authority by roughly an additional $200 million. ICE's gross budget authority for FY2013 was $5,738 million, a decrease of $125 million (2.1%) from the previous year's appropriation and an increase of $94 million (1.5%) over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by approximately $200 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for ICE to be $5,442 million, $420 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. ICE faces challenges in allocating resources to effectively carry out its mission due to the wide range of civil and criminal violations under its jurisdiction. ICE's budget for FY2013 was $5,738 million, with challenges in resource allocation due to the wide range of violations under its jurisdiction. The allocation of resources for ICE's mission, including detaining and removing deportable aliens, is a debated issue in Congress. ICE's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, with the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year. There are an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the United States, leading to debates on ICE's prioritization of removal. Amendments in House-passed H.R. 5855 aimed to direct ICE's enforcement actions. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year, leading to debates on how to prioritize removal. House-passed H.R. 5855 directed ICE to prioritize removing aliens convicted of crimes, with funds allocated for this purpose. The act prioritizes the identification and removal of aliens convicted of crimes by severity. ICE's ERO manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the US, but faces challenges with detention space. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees due to concerns about limited detention space and inequities in release decisions. These programs are seen as a lower cost and more proportional treatment option. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees to address limited detention space and inequities in release decisions. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a proposed reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. ICE released 2,228 detainees in early 2013 due to operating under a continuing resolution and upcoming sequestration-mandated reductions. In early 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees as a result of operating under a continuing resolution and impending sequestration-mandated reductions. ICE Director John Morton explained that despite funding for 34,000 beds, the average daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including those not required to be detained by law. Critics viewed the release as a political move to pressure Congress to avoid sequestration cuts. ICE released 2,228 detainees in early 2013, exceeding the mandated 34,000 detention beds. Critics saw it as a political move to pressure Congress. ICE is exploring alternatives to detention for non-dangerous aliens with final removal orders. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, such as electronic devices and home visits, for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals. The Administration sought to reduce detention bed space while increasing funding for ATD. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million for the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed levels and increased ATD funding by $20 million. Senate-reported S. 3216 reduced detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases funding for the ATD program by $19 million (27%). The Administration's request included $139 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice to check fingerprints of arrestees against DHS immigration records. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is seeking resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is requesting resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. They have the resources to identify more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators support the expansion of Secure Communities. The expansion of Secure Communities and appropriation of funds for FY2013 has sparked debate about the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws. Concerns include training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some support the federal initiative. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE believes Secure Communities screening is more efficient and cost-effective in identifying and removing priority aliens. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. The House passed H.R. 5855 funding the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. The House passed H.R. 5855 funding the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. P.L. 113-6 funds the 287(g) program at the same level. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations and policies. ICE established the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about its operations and policies. However, some argue that the program is not productive and is a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, created in 2001, is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail. The Public Advocate Office within ICE was established in 2012 but is considered a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for this position. TSA, created in 2001, is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems within the United States. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 under the Homeland Security Act to protect the aviation system from terrorist threats. TSA's responsibilities include deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies for passenger and baggage screening. Additionally, TSA assesses the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issues security regulations, and enforces them to ensure protection of transportation systems. The TSA is responsible for assessing the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issuing security regulations, and enforcing them. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill, with net direct discretionary appropriations shown in the graphic. The TSA's budget includes net direct discretionary appropriations for aviation security, with additional funding from airline security fees and other sources. The President's request also includes funds for capital investments in screening technology. Total budgetary resources from non-appropriated sources are detailed in Table 11. The President's request for TSA's budget includes a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, with $5,099 million allocated for aviation security. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from the previous year, but a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. The President's request for TSA's budget includes a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, with $5,099 million allocated for aviation security. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from the previous year, but a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. Additionally, $124 million was proposed for Surface Transportation Security, reflecting a decrease of $10 million (7.8%) from FY2012. The President's request proposed a decrease of $310 million (9.6%) from FY2012 levels for TSA's budget, with $124 million allocated for Surface Transportation Security, reflecting a decrease of $10 million (7.8%). The funding reductions were planned for checked baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, the FFDO program, and flight crew training. Additionally, transportation threat assessment and credentialing funding would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million. The requested funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing (TTAC) would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million, including a one-time increase of $30 million for TTAC infrastructure modernization (TIM) and adjustments to the fee-based Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) based on higher-than-anticipated worker turnover in the maritime industry. Funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%) from FY2012 levels. The requested funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%) from FY2012 levels. The requested funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) specified $930 million, a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). House-passed H.R. 5855 included gross budget authority of $7,498 million for TSA, offset by $2,400 million in collections and fees, for a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million, representing a $147 million (1.9%) decrease from the gross. The House-passed H.R. 5855 allocated $7,498 million for TSA budget activities, with a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million. This represents a decrease from the administration's request, with $5,041 million specified for aviation security. The House rejected proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $58 million increase in appropriations for aviation security. The House-passed bill allocated $126 million for surface transportation security, $2 million above the request but $8 million less than FY2012 enacted amount. The bill also included $57 million less for aviation security than requested, but with a smaller offset, appropriations actually rose $58 million above the Administration's request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. The House-passed bill included reductions in transportation security funding, with cuts to aviation security and transportation security support. These reductions were made to offset a budget shortfall created by the administration. The House committee reduced funding for transportation security, including cuts to aviation security and transportation security support, to offset a budget shortfall caused by the administration's reliance on passenger security fee increases that have not been enacted. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million, representing a decrease from the Administration's request. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. This reflected a 7.3% decrease from the Administration's request. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, leading to a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The reductions were attributed to unobligated prior-year balances and delayed fielding of checkpoint body scanners. The Appropriations Committee report cited unobligated prior-year balances for reductions in funding. This included a $8 million cut to screener staffing due to delayed checkpoint body scanner deployment. The committee allocated $24 million for the FFDO program, $12 million above the request. The Senate recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. TSA received $7,551 million in total gross budget authority under P.L. 113-6, $290 million less than FY2012 enacted level, with sequestration further reducing it by $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a reduction in TSA budget authority due to sequestration, with total spending estimated to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The funding levels for existing TSA program functions were outlined in Table 12, with the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. This does not represent a final funding level as transfers and adjustments are likely to occur. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a reduction in TSA budget authority due to sequestration, with total spending estimated to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. Table 12 outlines funding levels for existing TSA program functions, with the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not to exceed $5.00 per one-way trip, with concerns raised about the accuracy of per-segment application reflecting passenger usage. The Administration proposed changing the TSA passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission, doubling the fee on direct flights but not affecting connecting flights. Airlines have raised concerns about the potential impact on passenger air travel. The Administration proposed changing the TSA passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights but not affecting connecting flights. This change is estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. Previous administrations have also proposed increasing passenger security fees, but this current proposal has gained more support. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip, with all fees going towards aviation security. This proposal aimed to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million for aviation security costs and $200 million for deficit reduction. Previous administrations had also proposed fee increases, but this current proposal has more support. The Senate committee approved a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip, with all fees allocated to aviation security and deficit reduction. However, the House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger fees. The committee noted jurisdictional limitations over fees and had to find $115 million in offsets to cover budget assumptions. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees, with TSA identifying over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies. This includes reductions in travel, conferences, and support contracts. The TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies, including reductions in travel, conferences, support contracts, and overtime pay. Efficiency improvements are seen as crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA. Risk-based screening initiatives, such as the PreCheck program and modified screening procedures for children and flight crew members, have been implemented to focus resources based on security risk assessments. Trial programs for elderly passengers are also being conducted. The TSA has implemented modified screening procedures for children and trial programs for screening flight crew members and elderly passengers. These trial programs aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings. The PreCheck program is a cornerstone of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. The PreCheck program is part of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. It is currently available on a trial basis to certain members and is planned for further expansion in FY2013. The program is seen as a rational approach to screening that can increase efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. The House and Senate committees supported the expansion of the TSA PreCheck program in FY2013, citing it as a rational risk-based approach to screening that increases efficiency and reduces workforce requirements. The Senate committee directed TSA to report on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. The Senate committee expressed concern about the limited scope of TSA's known crew member pilot program and proposed expanding it to include flight attendants. TSA's risk-based screening pilot programs were viewed positively, but their behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers faced scrutiny and criticism. TSA also planned to increase the number of Behavior Detection Officers. The House committee report criticized TSA's plan to increase Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) without clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. TSA is required to provide semiannual briefings to the appropriations committees. The committee criticized TSA's plan to increase Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) without clear evidence of effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. The budget justification specified a $13 million reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew member self-defense training program. Neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee have adopted this. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the FFDO program at the FY2012 level. The House also passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in Screener Payroll and Screening Technology Maintenance. The House increased FFDO funding by $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in Screener Payroll and Screening Technology Maintenance. They directed TSA to utilize FFDOs and other law enforcement assets on commercial flights to complement air marshals. The Senate recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs, noting a slight decrease compared to FY2012 due to budget constraints. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security. The Coast Guard, fully funded at $25 million under P.L. 113-6, is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for security of U.S. ports, waterways, and territorial waters. It also conducts missions like search and rescue, environmental protection, and aids to navigation. Transferred to DHS in 2003, the President requested $8,377 million in discretionary funding. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime security, was transferred to DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in funding, with $6,791 million for operating expenses and $1,217 million for capital acquisitions. The House proposed $212 million more than the President's request, mainly for acquiring vessels, aircraft, and improving shore facilities. The House and Senate proposed additional funding for the Coast Guard's capital acquisitions, with the Senate recommending $282 million more than the President's request. This included funding for vessel procurement and overseas contingency operations. The House and Senate proposed additional funding for the Coast Guard's capital acquisitions, with the Senate recommending $282 million more than the President's request, directly under the Coast Guard rather than transferring this amount from the DOD budget as the President requested. The largest differences with the President's request had to do with vessel procurement. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority after taking into account the across-the-board cuts in Division G of the law, $68 million more than the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by roughly an additional $268 million, according to the DHS FY2013 expenditure plan. The plan projected gross total spending in FY2013 for USCG to be $10,132 million, $200 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $10,132 million for the USCG in FY2013, which was $200 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. Sequestration further reduced USCG budget authority by approximately $268 million. The funding levels for USCG operating expenses and acquisition and construction functions for FY2013 are outlined in Table 13 of the plan. The \"DHS Plan\" column reflects the budgetary resources available after sequestration was applied, but it is subject to potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration. The assessment of budgetary resources available through P.L. 113-6 after sequestration was applied as of April 26, 2013. Differences in funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills were notable, particularly regarding vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House bill funded four ($224 million) and the Senate bill funded six ($335 million). No funds were requested for additional Response Boat Medium vessels. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters. The House bill funded four ($224 million), and the Senate bill funded six ($335 million). No funds were requested for additional Response Boat Medium vessels. The House bill also would have provided no funds for the vessels but the Senate requested $8 million to build four more. The House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft, and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft, but made this request in the DOD's budget and requested no funds for MH-60 helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for either of these aircraft. The President requested $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for these aircraft under the Coast Guard's appropriation. P.L. 113-6 requires a future-years capital investment plan for FY2014 through FY2018 to be submitted alongside the President's budget request. DHS's sequestration operating plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with allocations for a national security cutter, fast response cutters, and other expenses. The DHS's sequestration operating plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with allocations for a national security cutter, fast response cutters, and other expenses. The Coast Guard's effort to replace or modernize its fleet of vessels has been a major issue for Congress over the last several years. The House bill would have provided $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids. The House bill allocates $86 million for long-range aircraft for the Coast Guard, addressing the fleet modernization issue. Additionally, $41 million is recommended for Coast Guard housing and aids, including funds for shore facilities backlog and the new headquarters building in Washington, DC. The House bill included funding for shore facilities backlog and the Coast Guard's new headquarters building. It also called for implementing card readers for TWIC at ports and on vessels. The Coast Guard was urged to issue a final rule for implementing card readers for TWIC at ports and on vessels. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports following a critical GAO report. The directive from P.L. 113-6 emphasized expediting the final TWIC reader rule. The agency was directed to expedite the final TWIC reader rule, with no further direction provided on Interagency Operations Centers. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes, identity theft, and computer-based attacks. The U.S. Secret Service's protection mission covers the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for those offices, and designated individuals. They also provide security for the White House, Vice President's residence, foreign missions in DC, and visiting foreign dignitaries. The U.S. Secret Service's protection mission includes the President, Vice President, their families, candidates, and designated individuals. They also provide security for the White House, foreign missions in DC, and visiting dignitaries. Additionally, the Secret Service is responsible for security at National Special Security Events, coordinating with various law enforcement units. The NSSE designation by the President authorizes the USSS to coordinate security arrangements for events in the United States, involving various law enforcement units. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with allocations for protection and investigation missions, and 7,061 FTE for personnel needs. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation. The Administration requested $988 million for the USSS in FY2012, with $324 million for its investigation mission and 7,061 FTE for personnel needs. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million, a decrease of $54 million from FY2012. This decrease was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. The decrease in the USSS budget for FY2013 compared to FY2012 was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million, reflecting a total decrease of $54 million. This decrease would have been partially offset by specific funding restoration for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program and Electronic Crimes Task Forces. The Senate's FY2013 DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS, reflecting a $54 million decrease from FY2012. However, it was $12 million above the Administration's request. The Senate also proposed restoring $8 million for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and providing $4 million above the request for priority domestic investigations. The Senate recommended $1.613 billion for the USSS in FY2013, $54 million less than FY2012 but $12 million above the Administration's request. They also proposed restoring $8 million for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and providing $4 million for priority domestic investigations. The USSS Director's actions regarding the Cartagena incident were approved. Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than FY2012. Post-sequester, $1.527 billion will be expended, $84 million less than the appropriated amount. For FY2013, Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for the Secret Service, $56 million less than the previous year. Post-sequester, $1.527 billion will be expended, with $84 million reduced primarily from protection and investigation missions. The DHS Plan column in Table 14 outlines the budgetary resources available after sequestration as of April 26, 2013. The Secret Service's funding levels for FY2013 were assessed in the \"DHS Plan\" column after sequestration, with potential concerns for Congress regarding balancing investigative and protective missions impacting overall operations. The Secret Service's main challenge is balancing its investigative and protective missions, with a focus on the protection mission receiving more resources and congressional attention. While the Service also investigates financial crimes, recent congressional actions primarily address its protection mission in light of potential terrorist threats and misconduct by agents. The Secret Service's protection mission has received more resources and congressional attention due to potential terrorist threats and misconduct by agents. Advocates for expanding the investigation mission argue that better threat investigation efforts enhance protection. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, including the National Protection and Programs Directorate, the Office of Health Affairs, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, the Office of Health Affairs, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The requested amount for these accounts in FY2013 was $5,911 million, with the House-passed bill proposing $5,930 million and the Senate-reported bill proposing $5,971 million. Both versions of the bill aimed to enhance protection through better threat investigation efforts. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $5,930 million, a 0.3% increase from the requested level and 4.4% above FY2012. Both House-passed and Senate-reported versions included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. P.L. 113-6 allocated $5,920 million after cuts, a 0.2% increase from the request and 4.3% above FY2012. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 allocated $5,920 million for disaster relief, offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. The enacted amounts for individual components of Title III for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, and post-sequester levels from P.L. 113-6 were also listed. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration has proposed moving the activities of the US-VISIT program from NPPD to other locations within the Department, while the House has proposed keeping some functions within the Directorate in a newly established Office of Biometric Identify Management. The House has proposed keeping some functions within the National Protection and Programs Directorate in a newly established Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013. The Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) is supported by the Administration with a budget request of $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013. This includes projects related to infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications. The FY2013 Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, reflecting a transfer of functions to the DHS Office of Policy. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, an increase of $278 million. The FY2013 IPIS budget request was $1,167 million, a 31.3% increase from FY2012, with a focus on securing federal information systems. This included a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security to aid agencies in meeting FISMA requirements. The FY2013 IPIS budget request included two major program increases: a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security to aid agencies in meeting FISMA requirements, and a $116 million increase to expand the Network Security Deployment project supporting the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The Network Security Deployment project, part of the National Cybersecurity Protection System, is receiving extra funding to expand deployment of version 3.0 for active defenses and version 2.2 for threat visualization. Additional funding includes $15 million for US-CERT to analyze data and $5 million for Multi-State Information support. The FY2013 budget request included increases in funding for threat visualization and information sharing capabilities, with $15 million allocated to US-CERT for data analysis and $5 million for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center to support state cybersecurity efforts. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million and communication activities by $7 million compared to the previous year. The FY2013 budget request decreased funding for infrastructure protection by $40 million (13.7%) and communication activities by $7 million (4.7%) compared to FY2012. The reduction in infrastructure protection was mainly due to a $19 million (20.1%) cut in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project, which ensures compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities. The Administration reduced funding for infrastructure protection by $40 million in the FY2013 budget. This included a $19 million cut in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project, which ensures compliance with CFATS at covered facilities. Additionally, $8 million in reductions was associated with the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises, with activities continuing under other projects. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, allocating funds for Management and Administration, IPIS, and infrastructure protection. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management. They provided $5 million less than requested for Management and Administration, citing unauthorized TSA fee increases and poor compliance with statutory requirements. Reductions in the IPIS request were mainly in the Security Compliance project. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with reductions in funding for Management and Administration due to unauthorized TSA fee increases and poor compliance with statutory requirements. The House also reduced funding for the Security Compliance project and deployment of the NCPS, citing concerns about program implementation and NPPD's ability to obligate funds. The House proposed $29 million less than requested for NPPD, with reductions in funding for deployment of the NCPS by $17 million. Other reductions included $3 million in the Global Cybersecurity Management project and $7 million in the Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications project. The House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider using alternative security programs developed by the private sector for approving security plans under CFATS. The House proposed reductions in funding for NPPD, including $3 million in the Global Cybersecurity Management project and $7 million in the Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications project. They directed NPPD to develop security capabilities, including continuous monitoring, for other agencies to use. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD. The House directed NPPD to develop security capabilities, including continuous monitoring, for other agencies to use. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, bombing prevention, vulnerability assessments, and the Security Compliance project. The Committee recommended additional funding for security projects, including $12 million more for the Security Compliance project than requested. They acknowledged unobligated funds for the project and the need for funds above the request for future implementation plans. However, they proposed $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project to support monitoring capabilities and other security measures. The Committee recommended additional funding for security projects, including $12 million more for the Security Compliance project than requested. They proposed $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project and recommended withholding $120 million until NPPD produces an expenditure plan. The Committee also recommended explaining the new centralized structure of the project in the expenditure plan. The Committee recommended increased funding for cybersecurity projects, including allocating $17 million for cybersecurity education and emphasizing the importance of enhancing the cybersecurity posture of state and local governments. They also highlighted the need for an explanation of the new centralized structure in the expenditure plan. The Committee recommended increased funding for cybersecurity projects, emphasizing the importance of improving the cybersecurity posture of state and local governments. They also recommended increases for the Office of Emergency Communications and emergency communication-related projects. The Committee recommended increased funding for cybersecurity projects and emergency communication-related projects, including the Next Generation Telecommunications project with a $5 million increase. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS program, and Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million for the IPIS program and Biometric Identity Management in FY2013. The FY2014 operating plan indicates $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include $13.5 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention and $20.6 million for vulnerability assessments. In FY2014, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million for the IPIS program and Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include $13.5 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention, $20.6 million for vulnerability assessments, $16.9 million for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, and $202 million for the Federal Network Security program. In FY2014, $77.9 million is allocated for CFATS, with $20.0 million on hold pending an expenditure plan from Congress. $202 million from the Federal Network Security program will assist federal agencies in acquiring monitoring equipment. GAO and the Coast Guard will monitor DHS progress on CFATS. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act directs GAO and the Coast Guard to monitor DHS progress in developing the CFATS program. GAO will review CFAT inspections, inspector training, and compliance barriers. NPPD must provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs. Additional instructions related to cybersecurity are included. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act directed NPPD to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs for the CFATS program. Additionally, federal agencies were instructed to submit expenditure plans to improve cybersecurity, with quarterly reports to be sent to OMB. OMB was to summarize these reports annually to Congress. Table 16 outlines funding levels for FY2012 and FY2013 for each PPA within the IPIS program. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) receives reports on the execution of plans annually from Congress. Table 16 shows funding levels for FY2012 and FY2013 within the IPIS program. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6. Issues with implementing CFATS compliance were identified in an internal review by NPPD. The Department is preparing for transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. An internal review identified issues with CFATS compliance, prompting ongoing program review and mitigation efforts. Congress is likely to oversee this issue. Additionally, cybersecurity has been a focus during the 112th Congress with various bills considered. Interest in developing and ensuring compliance with CFATS and oversight of cybersecurity issues have been highlighted during the 112th Congress. Various bills addressing cybersecurity aspects, such as information sharing and workforce development, have been considered. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure information systems is also a key focus. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure information systems may require additional resources for NPPD, specifically the Federal Protective Service, responsible for security of federal property and personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), within the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for protecting federal property, personnel, and buildings from criminal and terrorist threats. FPS operations focus on security measures like risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also assists other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel from criminal and terrorist threats. FPS employs law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, as well as contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) employs 1,225 law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, along with 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, with funding coming from security fees charged to GSA building tenants. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget for FY2013 included $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security operations, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. The House-passed H.R. 5855 made no specific changes to the FPS budget, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no changes but required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee required the Office of Under Secretary for NPPD and FPS Director to brief on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6. FPS was directed to update on progress in implementing GAO recommendations. The Senate Appropriations Committee required updates on FPS management and budget improvement efforts, specifically on implementing GAO recommendations. Congress is concerned about aspects of the FPS mission and funding, including improving training for contract guards, federalizing contract guards, and developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies. Appropriators are interested in enhancing training for contract guards, federalizing them, setting standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to improve federal building security but was not enacted. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735 was introduced. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to enhance federal building security by setting staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expanding the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees programs like BioWatch and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like BioWatch and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, and coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component. OHA received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for FY2013. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations and requested $166 million for FY2013. The proposed funding allocation includes $125 million for BioWatch, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013. The House-passed bill allocated $132 million for FY2013, $35 million less than FY2012, and $34 million less than the President's request. The decrease was mainly due to reduced funding for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012 and the President's request. The Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million for FY2013, $1 million more than FY2012 and $2 million more than the President's request. The committee also suggested small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses, as well as $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, $35 million less than FY2012, and $34 million less than the President's request. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provides $132 million for OHA, $35 million less than FY2012, and $34 million less than the President's request. Reductions in total enacted budget authority for FY2013 largely reflect decreased funding for BioWatch, as recommended by the House. The enacted budget authority for FY2013 reflects decreased funding for BioWatch, as recommended by the House. Table 17 shows funding amounts for OHA components for FY2012 and FY2013 under P.L. 113-6, with the DHS Plan column indicating post-sequester resources. The department may undertake transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impacts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended decreased funding for BioWatch in FY2013 under P.L. 113-6. The committee also highlighted the separation of activities within DHS to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, directing the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA. The House Appropriations Committee recommended decreased funding for BioWatch in FY2013 under P.L. 113-6 and highlighted the separation of activities within DHS to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate explanatory statement reiterated the House Committee's comments about coordination of WMD activities and called for a comprehensive review of WMD operations. The Senate explanatory statement reiterates the House Committee's comments on coordination of WMD activities and calls for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including potential performance improvements and cost savings from an OHA/DNDO merger. This review is due to Congress by September 1, 2013, in place of the House-requested report. The BioWatch program deploys sensors in over 30 U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens for early medication distribution. The BioWatch program, which deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens, is a significant part of OHA's budget. The program has faced challenges in deploying more advanced sensors, known as \"Generation-3\" sensors, due to technical and management issues. The estimated life cycle cost for Gen-3 sensors is $5.8 billion. The BioWatch Gen-3 program, aimed at detecting airborne pathogens faster, has faced technical and management challenges. The estimated $5.8 billion life cycle cost raises questions about its justification for such a large investment. Congressional appropriators have shown interest in the program's performance, with funding limitations and calls for reviews in the past. The reduced funding for FY2013 hinders further development and deployment of Gen-3 capability. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is tasked with reducing loss of life and property from all hazards through a comprehensive emergency management system. Funding limitations for the BioWatch Gen-3 program in FY2013 hinder its development and deployment. FEMA leads and supports the nation's preparedness for disasters through a comprehensive emergency management system. It provides assistance to state and local governments for incident response, recovery, and mitigation, funded by the Disaster Relief Fund and Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. The Administration requested $4,528 million in net budget authority for FEMA. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, an increase of $261 million (6.1%) over the enacted FY2012 level. Additionally, an extra $5,481 million was requested for the Disaster Relief Fund, funded by an adjustment to the discretionary budget cap under the Budget Control Act. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, a decrease from the President's request but an increase from FY2012. This included $23 million added through floor amendments and the requested funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, including $23 million added through floor amendments and funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate-reported S. 3216 would have provided $4,582 million for FEMA, an increase from the President's request and FY2012. P.L. 113-6 ultimately allocated $4,351 million for FEMA, $84 million more than FY2012. After across-the-board cuts and sequestration, P.L. 113-6 provides $4,351 million for FEMA in FY2013, $84 million more than FY2012. The bill includes $1 million less than requested for the Disaster Relief Fund due to the impacts of the cuts. Additionally, $6,400 is allocated for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act, paid for by the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. FEMA would receive $4,150 million after sequestration. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. These numbers do not reflect the full range of appropriated resources available to FEMA. The impact of transfers or reprogrammings on the sequester's effects is uncertain. FEMA received a significant capital infusion from P.L. 113-2, but post-sequester funding levels remain unclear. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints, impacting national preparedness levels. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal, impacting the national preparedness level. The goal includes concrete, measurable, and prioritized objectives to mitigate specific threats and vulnerabilities. The national preparedness goal defines core capabilities to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, superseding a previous directive issued after 9/11. The security directive (HSPD-8) issued after 9/11 established the national preparedness goal to strengthen the US's ability to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks and disasters. The first National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was released on October 7, 2011, defining core capabilities and targets for a secure and resilient Nation. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) established core capabilities and targets for a secure and resilient Nation, aiming to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. Prior to 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for state and local governments for homeland security. Several additional homeland security grant programs were added to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Citizen Corps Program (CCP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), Driver's License Security Grants Program (REAL ID), and Operation Stonegarden. Several additional homeland security grant programs were added to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Citizen Corps Program (CCP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), Driver's License Security Grants Program (REAL ID), Operation Stonegarden grant program (Stonegarden), Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPG), Public Transportation Security Assistance and Rail Security Assistance grant program (Transit Grants), Port Security Grants (Port Security), Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance (Over-the-Road), Buffer Zone Protection Program (BZPP), Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program (IECGP), and Emergency Operations Center Grant Program (EOC). The federal government provides assistance through various grant programs for state and local governments to enhance public safety preparedness. However, this assistance only makes up a small portion of the total annual expenditures of $218 billion by state and local governments on public safety, which includes police protection, fire protection, correction, and protective inspections. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, $400 million more than was appropriated for FY2012. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee denied the request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under the NPGP. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns over the Administration's request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program for FY2013. They cited lack of congressional authorization, insufficient program details, and stakeholder participation, as well as uncertainty about risk assessments and funding allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House expressed concerns about the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants for FY2013. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and recommending the grant structure enacted in FY2012 to be continued. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for FY2013, recommending the grant structure enacted in FY2012 to be continued. Grant funding would have been distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.7 billion for various security programs including Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee suggested $1.6 billion for the same year. The House recommended $1.7 billion for security programs in FY2013, including $55 million for Operation Stonegarden, $150 million for high-risk areas, and $232 million for education/training/exercises. The Senate suggested $1.6 billion, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance. The State Homeland Security Grant Program received $55 million for Operation Stonegarden, $676 million for Urban Area Security Initiative, $132 million for Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance, $132 million for Port Security Grants, and $234 million for education, training, and exercises in FY2013. The total budget for state and local programs was $1,467 million, a 20.3% decrease from the requested level but 8.6% higher than FY2012, before sequestration further reduced funding for FEMA's state and local grants program. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,467 million for state and local programs, a decrease of 20.3% from the requested level and 8.6% above FY2012. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by roughly an additional $77 million. The actual funding available for grants is $132 million higher in total due to the removal of a transfer from the grant programs that had paid FEMA's administrative costs. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,467 million for state and local programs, a decrease of 20.3% from the requested level and 8.6% above FY2012. The actual funding available for grants is $132 million higher in total due to the removal of a transfer from the grant programs that had paid FEMA's administrative costs. The \"DHS Plan\" column outlines the post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. DHS historically sets aside up to 5% of AFG funding for program management. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. DHS historically sets aside up to 5% of AFG funding for program management. Starting in FY2013, grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office. Legislative language was requested to allow SAFER grants to be used to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The Administration requested legislative language to use SAFER grants for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. Up to 4.7% of the appropriation would be designated for program administration. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, designating up to 4.7% for program administration. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. Both bills denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The Senate bill also included the requested SAFER waiver authority language. The Senate Committee denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS is expected to consider economic hardship when exercising the SAFER waiver authority. The DRF is the main account used to fund various emergency and disaster assistance programs, grants, and aid to those affected. It is funded annually through regular appropriations, but often runs out before the end of the fiscal year due to high demand. Administrative costs for AFG and SAFER are now derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account under P.L. 113-6, which also grants DHS SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. It is funded annually through regular appropriations but often runs out before the end of the fiscal year due to high demand. The reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, with average monthly expenditures exceeding the average regular appropriation between 2005 and 2011. The reliance on supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been due to underfunding, with average monthly expenditures exceeding regular appropriations between 2005 and 2011. In FY2013, the Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF, a decrease from the previous year, which included a $6,400 million supplemental. $608 million was requested for activities not directly tied to major disasters. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The request included $608 million for activities not directly tied to major disasters and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The administration requested $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act in FY2013, reflecting the impact of the Budget Control Act. This request was more than three times the size of the request from FY2012. The FY2013 request for disaster relief funding was over three times the size of the request from FY2012. The Administration requested funding based on past declared catastrophic events, a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a $500 million reserve. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's funding request for the Disaster Relief Fund. Additionally, both bills included an unrequested transfer of $24 million to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2013 matched the Administration's funding request for the Disaster Relief Fund. Both bills included a $24 million transfer to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 allocated $7,007 million to the DRF, with $24 million earmarked for audits on public assistance projects and FEMA's debris removal decisions. The FY2013 budget allocated $24 million to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits on disaster-related spending. Additionally, $918 million more was provided for the Disaster Relief Fund than the Administration's initial request. Sequestration reduced the DHS budget by 5% to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act directed the Office of Management and Budget to calculate an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief annually. The FY2013 DHS budget was reduced by 5% due to sequestration, bringing it down to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act allows for an adjustment for disaster relief to prevent sequestration triggered by exceeding discretionary spending caps. This adjustment provides additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. The Budget Control Act allows for an adjustment to prevent sequestration triggered by exceeding discretionary spending caps for disaster relief funding under the Stafford Act. This funding is distinct from the Disaster Relief Fund and comes from various federal accounts. While some DRF funding is eligible for adjustment, it is not solely defined as \"disaster relief\" by the BCA. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) receives funding from various federal accounts, including an allowable adjustment under the Budget Control Act (BCA) for disaster relief. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion due to legislation and supplemental assistance. The government operated under a continuing resolution, carrying over $6,400 in disaster assistance from FY2012. Congress approved $11,485 million in additional resources for the Disaster Relief Fund through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. This exceeded the available allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY2013. In FY2013, the Relief Appropriations Act provided emergency funding to cover disaster relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act. This marked the first time the Disaster Relief Fund received all available funding under the Budget Control Act. In FY2013, emergency funding covered relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act for the first time. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, suggesting it duplicated the HMGP. The PDM program, funded by the National Flood Insurance Program, awards grants for mitigation projects before disaster events, unlike HMGP. While NFIP programs only address flood hazards, PDM and HMGP cover all types of hazards. The Administration noted over $174 million in unobligated balances for the PDM program. The PDM program, funded by the National Flood Insurance Program, awards grants for mitigation projects before disaster events. Unlike HMGP, which applies to all types of hazards, PDM focuses on flood hazards. The Administration noted over $174 million in unobligated balances for the PDM program, allowing it to continue awarding grants for several years. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills proposed small amounts for appropriation, signaling concerns about the slow pace of awards and the large unobligated balance. Both chambers also planned to rescind some funding. The Senate-reported bill proposed reducing funding for the PDM program to $35 million, expressing concerns about slow award pace and large unobligated balance. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 allocated just under $25 million for PDM, presenting challenges in funding state minimum awards and new applications. For FY2013, the post-sequester amount for PDM is just under $25 million, presenting challenges in funding state minimum awards and new applications. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, requesting $100 million, a reduction of $20 million from FY2012. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program in FY2013, requesting $100 million, a $20 million reduction from FY2012. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, with the House keeping the funding level at $120 million for FY2013 and the Senate suggesting an increase to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million according to the DHS operating plan. The House has kept the EFS program funding at $120 million for FY2013, while the Senate proposed an increase to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arise from the program's delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. The distribution of funds for the EFS program was delayed in FY2012, taking nine months to begin, which was double the time allowed by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The requested amount for these accounts in FY2013 was $1,561 million, a decrease of $229 million from the previous year. The House-passed bill allocated $1,510 million, a 3.3% decrease from the requested level.

P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million after across-the-board cuts, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level. Table 19 shows enacted amounts for Title IV components in FY2012, FY2013 requests, House and Senate appropriations, P.L. 113-6 levels, and post-sequester resources reported by DHS. USCIS focuses on immigration petition adjudication. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is primarily involved in adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The graphic shows direct appropriations for USCIS, excluding fee income. USCIS funds its operations through direct appropriations and fee income, primarily from the Examinations Fee Account. The agency was directed to restructure its revenue with the creation of this account. USCIS funds its operations through direct appropriations and fee income, primarily from the Examinations Fee Account. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. In FY2013, USCIS had a gross budget authority of $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. This included funding for programs like E-Verify, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and the SAVE Program. The FY2013 USCIS budget includes $20 million for the SAVE Program to verify individuals' eligibility for public benefits based on immigration status. The remaining $2,862 million is expected to be funded by fee collections, with allocations for adjudication services, information and customer services, and administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a gross budget authority of $3,004 million for USCIS in FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for the requested pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify.

The Committee did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection based on a 2012 OIG report. They directed USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to assess USCIS actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a FY2013 budget for USCIS at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, instead allocating $20 million from USCIS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations, with an additional $5 million to be funded through fees. No direct appropriations were recommended for the SAVE program, with USCIS directed to allocate $20 million from user fee revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations and an additional $5 million via fees. They directed that no appropriations be used for the Office of Citizenship Services and expressed concern about the program's administration costs. They limited the use of grant funding for program administration to 5% in FY2013. The grant program's funding level for FY2013 was $114 million, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would reduce the funding to $109 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee limited the use of grant funding for program administration to 5%. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce USCIS funding to $109 million, below the requested level of $143 million and above the FY2012 enacted level of $102 million. Potential issues for the FY2013 budget cycle include transfers and reprogrammings to mitigate sequestration impacts. For FY2013 budget cycle, potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS primarily supports itself through fee revenue. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations accurately to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. USCIS must include the costs of operations in future fee adjustments and continue to brief the Committee quarterly. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains an ongoing issue. The House Committee directed USCIS to include operational costs in future fee adjustments and provide quarterly briefings on fee revenues. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a contentious issue, with $7.5 million allocated from fee revenue in FY2013. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 mandates USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from fee revenue for immigrant integration grants in FY2013. An additional $2.5 million in appropriations is also designated for these grants. The funds cannot be used for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The House Committee expressed disappointment in the slow progress of the USCIS Transformation program. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract.

They also urged DHS to review refugee processing procedures to improve coordination for vulnerable individuals in need of resettlement to the United States. The Committee urged DHS to review refugee processing procedures to streamline processing for vulnerable individuals needing resettlement in the United States. They also encouraged the use of parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs and medical emergencies. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use its parole authority under Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to address urgent humanitarian needs, particularly in the interest of family unity and to address medical emergencies following natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in January 2010. They also urged the allocation of sufficient resources for similar responsiveness to future deadly disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides law enforcement instruction to federal entities with specialized training. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) offers basic and advanced law enforcement instruction to various federal, state, and local entities, as well as international agencies. FLETC aims to promote consistency and collaboration among its partner organizations through multi-agency training. FLETC provides law enforcement training to various agencies to promote consistency and collaboration. It operates four training sites in the US and offers online training as well. The proposed budget for FLETC is $258 million, a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The budget for FLETC is proposed at $258 million, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, and Related Expenses. The reductions were due to efficiencies and deferred construction work. House-passed H.R. 5855 included $256 million for FLETC, $16 million below the previous year's appropriation. The proposed reduction in Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at FLETC was due to deferring construction work. House-passed H.R. 5855 included $256 million for FLETC, $16 million below last year's level. The House Appropriations Committee cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases to fund parts of its budget. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriation by $2 million (6.8%) due to the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases. Senate-reported S. 3216 allocated $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. After cuts directed by P.L. 113-6, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a decrease of $1 million from the requested level but $14 million below the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration would further reduce this to $245 million for FLETC. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D), conducting R&D in its own laboratories and funding R&D in DOE national laboratories, industry, and universities. It also supports acquisitions by other DHS components. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from the previous year. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from the previous year. The request for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) was $212 million above the FY2012 level, with the largest increase in funding for disaster resilience R&D. The FY2013 budget request for the S&T Directorate included a significant increase in funding for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI), with a focus on disaster resilience R&D. There was a notable reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities, particularly due to the absence of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The FY2013 budget request for the S&T Directorate included increased funding for RDI, focusing on disaster resilience.

Federal government spending involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress, which may be indefinite. Budget authority can be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be indefinite or on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year authority is limited to a specific fiscal year, while multi-year and no-year authority allow spending over a range of time or indefinitely. Obligations occur when agencies hire personnel, enter contracts, or receive services. Budget authority specifies a time range for spending funds; no-year authority allows indefinite obligation. Obligations are incurred when agencies engage in transactions, while outlays are actual funds spent in a fiscal year. Budget authority may be obligated in one year but spent in a future year, especially with certain contracts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending not mandated by existing law. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded each year in appropriations acts. Gross budget authority for federal agencies includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. The federal budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws outside of appropriation acts. Mandatory spending excludes appropriations for entitlements and includes programs that must be appropriated each year, such as Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS. Offset funds collected by the government are used for business-type transactions. The Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds collected by the government are used for business-type transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. These entitlements are funded by permanent collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget features mandatory entitlement programs such as the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are available for obligation and included in the President's budget. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are available for obligation and included in the President's budget. The federal government has shown increasing interest in funding for homeland security efforts since the 9/11 attacks. Since the 9/11 attacks, there has been a growing focus on funding for homeland security. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, with homeland security funding analysis included since 2002. The analysis has become more refined over the years, allowing for precise distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities. Homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. While Table B-1 allows for year-to-year comparisons, the increasing specificity of the analysis may make them not strictly comparable. It is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security, with the DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 accounting for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security. The DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 accounted for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense following at nearly 26%. The top five agencies collectively made up approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. The top five agencies in homeland security spending accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, as legacy agencies also conduct other activities. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion specifically for homeland security. The enacted FY2012 budget bills and existing law allocated $35.1 billion for homeland security within the total DHS budget authority of $52.5 billion. However, the amounts in Table B-1 may not align with total amounts in the report due to inconsistencies. The same discrepancy between homeland security budget authority and total budget authority applies to other agencies listed. Authoritative data for FY2013 is unavailable due to the impact of P.L. 113-6 and sequestration on the Administration's budget release. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available due to the impact of P.L. 113-6 and sequestration on the Administration's budget release."
