    "content": "The \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to teachers. Congress finds that elementary and secondary school enrollment is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The trend is projected to continue with an additional 3 million students over the next decade, particularly in secondary schools. The next decade will see a significant increase in student enrollment, with over 3,000,000 additional students expected. This growth will impact high poverty urban and rural areas, as well as states with rapid population growth. To accommodate the rising number of students, schools will need to hire 150,000 more teachers. Data and research from Project STAR suggest that smaller class sizes benefit elementary and secondary school students, leading to increased learning and long-term academic advantages. This highlights the need for schools to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade to accommodate the growing student population. Research shows that students in smaller classes in the early grades outperform their peers in normal-sized classrooms, with added students diminishing learning for the rest. It is crucial to adequately educate children for the future and improve the learning environment by hiring more teachers. Congress must fund positions to support this goal. Congress needs to fund positions for teachers without adding to the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, and provide resources to keep pace with growing enrollment and reduce classroom sizes. The grant program is established to fund positions for teachers without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, and to provide resources for growing enrollment and reducing classroom sizes. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors to fund hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must submit an application to be eligible for the grant, and the Secretary cannot disapprove an application if funds are available. To receive a grant from the Governor, a local educational agency must establish a trust fund for payments, deposit funds into the trust account, and use the funds to hire new teachers or qualified personnel. The Act requires that funds received must be deposited in a trust fund account and used to hire new teachers or qualified personnel within 2 years. The agency must follow accounting practices set by the Governor, allow access to records, and ensure a net gain in teachers or instructional staff. The agency must provide access to records of funds received and used under the Act, ensure a net gain in teachers or instructional staff, review personnel performance annually, limit employment period to one year, and repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months. The agency must repay unspent funds to the State within 27 months of receipt, use funds only to supplement non-Federal sources for student education, and apply to the Governor annually. The agency must use funds to supplement non-Federal sources for student education and apply to the Governor annually to receive funding under this Act. SEC. 4. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. Each State is eligible to receive an amount based on the average number of children aged 5 through 17 in the State. Any unused funds will be reallocated to other States. SEC. 5. FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. A Governor can withhold payments to a local educational agency for noncompliance with section 3(c) after 60 days notice. The agency must increase teachers or qualified personnel to continue receiving funds. SEC. 6. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. The Governor receiving a grant must select local educational agencies based on overcrowded classes. They must evaluate and report on the funds used by the agencies annually. The Governor receiving a grant must select local educational agencies based on overcrowded classes. Agencies must evaluate and report on funds used for programs annually. Governors can use a small percentage of funds for administrative costs and up to 10% for innovative teaching programs. A Governor can use up to 10% of funds to improve instructional quality through innovative teaching programs, alternate certification procedures, or hiring nontraditional personnel. The Secretary of Education must report to relevant committees on these initiatives. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with Governors, must report annually to congressional committees on the effectiveness of programs funded under the Act and provide recommendations for program continuity. SEC. 7. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not grant tenure to personnel hired under it. SEC. 8. DEFINITION. Defines \"local educational agency,\" \"State,\" and \"Secretary.\" SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1999 to 2003: $500,000,000 for 1999, $1,000,000,000 for 2000, $1,500,000,000 for 2001, $2,000,000,000 for 2002, and $2,500,000,000 for 2003."
