    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. H.R. 1540 passed the House, while S. 1253 and S. 1867 were reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, after resolving disputes over detainee provisions. The White House has criticized aspects of both S. 1253 and S. 1867, threatening to veto any legislation. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with provisions inserted from the House bill. Differences between the two versions will be discussed in conference. The White House has threatened to veto any legislation that challenges the President's intelligence collection authorities and ability to prosecute terrorists. The Administration opposes military detention mandates, limits on executive discretion, and constraints on detainee transfers. The Administration strongly opposes provisions mandating military detention, limiting executive discretion in prosecuting terrorist suspects, and constraining detainee transfers. The report provides background on the issues, analyzes House and Senate bills, and compares their approaches. Both bills aim to confirm or expand detention authority granted to the President by Congress. The detainee provisions in both House and Senate bills aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President by Congress after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks through the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Authorization for Use of Military Force after 9/11 allowed the President to use force against those involved in the attacks and prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals have been detained to prevent further hostilities or terrorist activities, with some facing military commission trials. Subsequent U.S operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere have led to preventive detention of individuals to prevent them from engaging in hostilities or terrorism. Some have faced military commission trials, while others have been tried in civilian court for terrorism-related crimes. The 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld established that the President can detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities, with lower courts tasked to define the scope of detention authority. The AUMF allows the President to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The Hamdi decision left it to lower courts to define the scope of detention authority under the AUMF, including whether it permits detention of Al Qaeda, Taliban, or other group members apprehended outside Afghanistan. The D.C. Circuit has handled habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention legality. Most judicial activity on U.S. detention policy has occurred in the D.C. Circuit, where courts have considered habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention legality. The U.S. Court of Appeals rulings have generally favored the government's position on detention authority under the AUMF. The Supreme Court may review these rulings to determine the AUMF's scope of detention authority. The D.C. Circuit has ruled in favor of the government's detention authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and endorse or reject them. Congress has not passed any legislation to clarify the scope of detention authority under the AUMF. The circuit court has considered post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance on who can be detained. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance on who can be detained. In 2010, they concluded that persons associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as those who support them in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners, can be detained under the AUMF. Most detainees are combatants captured during military operations. Most detainees under the AUMF are combatants associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, or those who support them in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. They are often captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or a facility in Parwan, Afghanistan. Detainees captured in military operations are held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan, Afghanistan. High-value Guantanamo detainees were initially held by the CIA for interrogation. Persons arrested in the US for terrorist activity are usually prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention under the AUMF. In the United States, persons arrested for terrorist activity are typically prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention under the AUMF. There have been rare cases where individuals were designated as \"enemy combatants\" and transferred to military custody, including a U.S. citizen suspected of being part of Taliban forces in Afghanistan and a legal permanent resident alien. The detainees, one a U.S. citizen suspected of being part of Taliban forces in Afghanistan and the other a legal permanent resident alien alleged to be an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent,\" were initially held as \"enemy combatants\" but later transferred to civil authorities for trial in federal court. The legal validity of their prior military detention became uncertain as their habeas petitions were pending before the Supreme Court. There has been controversy over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some advocating for military detention and trial by military commission, while others argue for transfer to civil authorities for trial in federal court. There is disagreement over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some advocating for military detention and trial by military commission, while others argue for transfer to civil authorities for trial in federal court. Some suggest leaving the decision to executive discretion based on the specific circumstances of each case. The debate over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody continues, with some advocating for military detention and trial by military commission, while others argue for transfer to civil authorities for trial in federal court. The disagreement stems from differing opinions on whether the traditional law enforcement model or executive discretion should be the exclusive method for handling such cases. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States for trial in Article III courts. The Administration's plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed, to the United States for trial in Article III courts were blocked by Congress through funding restrictions for FY2011 and FY2012. Other legislative measures limiting executive discretion on detainee transfers were also extended. The 2012 Minibus Act extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees through FY2012. This restriction effectively limits prosecution options to military commissions as civilian courts do not operate at Guantanamo. The 2012 Minibus Act extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees through FY2012, making military commissions the only viable option for prosecuting detainees. Attention has been drawn to instances of terrorist suspects being apprehended by U.S. authorities, such as Somali national Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame facing terrorism charges in a civilian court after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for interrogation. Some argue he should have remained in military custody abroad, while others advocate for transfer to civilian custody. Warsame, a Somali national, faced terrorism charges in a civilian court after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for two months. Controversy arose over whether he should have been kept in military custody abroad or transferred to civilian custody immediately. Similar debates surrounded the arrests of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, with some arguing they should have been detained and interrogated by military authorities. The Administration also faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against two Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities in Iraq. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against two Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities in Iraq. The 2012 NDAA is likely to address the disposition of persons apprehended by U.S. authorities in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, contains relevant provisions. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of individuals captured by U.S. authorities in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, includes provisions reaffirming the conflict, imposing restrictions on transferring wartime detainees, setting conditions for releasing Guantanamo detainees, and requiring foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The 2012 NDAA includes provisions to restrict the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees and require foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The White House criticized these provisions and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. The White House criticized provisions in the 2012 NDAA concerning detainee matters and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 authorized detention of certain persons, required military detention for some, regulated status determinations for AUMF detainees, and made funding restrictions on Guantanamo transfers permanent. The 2012 NDAA included provisions for detainee matters, such as authorizing detention of certain persons and regulating status determinations for AUMF detainees. Senate Majority Leader Reid delayed consideration of the bill due to objections from the White House and Senate committees. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a new version of the bill with revised detainee provisions. The Department of Defense also objected to the revised provisions. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the Department of Defense and the White House threatening to veto any bill that challenges the President's authorities in handling terrorist suspects. The amendment clarified that the provision affirming the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda did not affect existing authorities regarding the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions, affirming the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda without affecting existing authorities regarding U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The bill will now be reconciled in conference to address differences between the House and Senate versions. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions, affirming the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda without affecting existing authorities regarding U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. Differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill will be considered in conference. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities with respect to detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA is discussed, including detention authority under the AUMF, initial status determinations, periodic reviews of detainee cases, and concerns about recidivism in transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF is not clearly defined, leading to differing interpretations. The President's authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda is supported by the AUMF, but the scope of this authority is subject to debate. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF is not clearly defined and can be subject to differing interpretations. It allows the President to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces, and associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The President has the authority to detain individuals involved in 9/11 attacks, those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces, and associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" raises questions about the breadth of detention authority claimed by the executive under the AUMF. The AUMF grants the executive authority to detain individuals involved in 9/11 attacks, supporting Taliban or al-Qaida, and associated forces. However, the broad category of \"associated forces\" raises concerns about exceeding the AUMF's mandate, particularly regarding indefinite detention based on providing support to belligerent forces. The government has not clarified these aspects in its 2009 brief. The government has not clarified the aspects of indefinite detention based on providing support to belligerent forces under the law of war principles. The Obama Administration's scope of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's definition. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support\" to be considered an \"enemy combatant.\" Recent court decisions have focused on proof of detainee involvement with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority requires \"substantial support\" to be considered an \"enemy combatant.\" Recent court decisions have focused on detainee involvement with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces, with the Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit relying on proof of functional affiliation with these groups. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, following the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi authorizing detention of enemy combatants under the AUMF. Lower courts have been tasked with defining the full parameters of detention authority conferred by the AUMF. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi authorized the detention of enemy combatants under the AUMF for the duration of hostilities. The government clarified in 2009 that the AUMF does not limit the covered organizations to just al-Qaida or the Taliban, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with various armed groups in Afghanistan to prevent future acts of terrorism against the United States. The AUMF allows the US to detain individuals associated with armed groups like al-Qaida and the Taliban to prevent future terrorism. This authority extends to groups fighting alongside these organizations, as seen in the case of Chinese Uighur dissidents captured in Afghanistan. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court accepted the government's criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" related to al Qaida or the Taliban. The court accepted the government's criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" related to al Qaida or the Taliban, but did not find evidence to support the second and third prongs, making it unnecessary to reach the first. The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely associated with al Qaida or the Taliban, arguing that ETIM falls under the AUMF. The government defined \"associated force\" as closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, arguing that ETIM falls under the AUMF due to its connection to the September 11 attacks. The court noted the need for a close operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" under the government's definition. The decision might have been different if a plain-language interpretation was adopted. In a 2009 brief, the government indicated that the definition of \"associated forces\" needed further development through application to concrete facts. So far, in habeas cases, \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups aiding the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, such as \"Zubayda's militia\" assisting Osama bin Laden's escape from Tora Bora. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to include armed groups aiding the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, such as \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\"). The D.C. Circuit also affirmed the detention of a person engaged as a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a person supporting attacks against coalition and Afghan forces. The AUMF may authorize force against associated forces outside Afghanistan, raising uncertainty about detention authority. The AUMF may authorize the use of force against associated forces outside of Afghanistan, leading to uncertainty about detention authority for individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens or those with significant ties to the United States. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF for such individuals remains unclear. The AUMF allows detention of U.S. citizens captured in Afghanistan but is unclear for those captured outside. U.S. courts have upheld detention of individuals linked to Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured abroad. The AUMF allows detention of U.S. citizens captured in Afghanistan but is unclear for those captured outside. U.S. courts have upheld detention of individuals linked to Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured abroad. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the United States as enemy combatants. The circumstances of detaining individuals captured or arrested in the United States under the AUMF authority remain unsettled. The Supreme Court may consider the case regarding the detention of individuals captured in the United States under the AUMF authority. Combatant Status Review Tribunals were established by the Pentagon in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 related to \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo. These tribunals determine if detainees are subject to detention based on enemy belligerency status. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determine detainee status based on enemy belligerency. CSRTs confirmed 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees at Guantanamo. The CSRT process confirmed the status of 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. It has been inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees at Guantanamo. Any new detainees brought to Guantanamo would likely go through a CSRT. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. The Supreme Court has extended habeas rights to non-citizens held at Guantanamo. Non-citizen detainees held in Afghanistan have a different status review process with fewer rights compared to those at Guantanamo. Lower court rulings have not granted non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan the privilege to challenge their detention in federal court. President Obama established task forces to address issues related to Guantanamo and U.S. detention policy shortly after taking office. The Obama Administration created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. Military commission and review board proceedings at Guantanamo were put on hold while awaiting recommendations. A new review system was implemented in 2009 for detainees at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. The CSRTs were put on hold while awaiting recommendations. In 2009, a new review system was implemented for detainees at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 for the periodic review of detainees at Guantanamo. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 to establish a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for assessing the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees to protect against security threats. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo to protect against security threats. If detention is not warranted, efforts will be made to transfer detainees outside the US. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo to protect against security threats. Detainees may challenge their detention and present evidence at a hearing within a year of the order's issuance. The process is discretionary and does not create any additional basis for detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for Guantanamo detainees to have their cases reviewed periodically. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers due to concerns about potential terrorist activity post-release. The legality of a person's continued detention is a concern, especially regarding Guantanamo detainees being released and potentially engaging in terrorist activities. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers to prevent this, requiring certification of measures in the destination country. Statistics on post-release activities are limited, but it is known that some detainees have been involved in terrorist activities after their release. The release of Guantanamo detainees has raised concerns about their involvement in terrorist activities post-release. While some have engaged in militant activities, the policy implications and fairness of long-term detention without trial remain controversial. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that 30 former detainees had participated in anti-U.S. activities. The Pentagon reported in 2007 that 30 former Guantanamo detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda post-release, sparking debates on the fairness of long-term detention without trial. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged the accuracy of these numbers and highlighted discrepancies in the data. Researchers at Seton Hall University School of Law Center for Policy and Research questioned the accuracy of Pentagon data on former Guantanamo detainees' post-release activities, disputing the classification of their actions as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement\" due to lack of evidence linking them to terrorist or insurgent activities. The Pentagon data on former Guantanamo detainees' post-release activities was questioned by researchers at Seton Hall University School of Law Center for Policy and Research. The data did not establish in each case that the detainee had engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity, and suggested that post-release terrorist conduct could be due to radicalization during internment. The Defense Intelligence Agency reported in 2008 that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to publicly release intelligence on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The Director of National Intelligence was required to release an unclassified summary of intelligence on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The report in December 2010 revealed that 13.5% of transferred detainees were confirmed and 11.5% suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 are in custody, and 83 are at large. The report on Guantanamo detainees revealed that 81 (13.5 percent) are confirmed and 69 (11.5 percent) are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 are in custody, and 83 are at large. Additionally, 2 confirmed and 3 suspected detainees have participated in terrorist activities since Executive Order 13492. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned. The report on Guantanamo detainees revealed that 81 are confirmed and 69 are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned, with estimates suggesting that the actual figure of released detainees posing a threat is closer to 6%. The discrepancy between the report's estimate of detainee recidivism numbers and publicly available estimates remains unexplained due to classified intelligence data. The House of Representatives passed subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540 on May 26, 2011, defining \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" and addressing detainee recidivism related to terrorism activities post-release. The discrepancy between publicly available estimates and the DNI's report on detainee reengagement remains unexplained due to classified intelligence data. Section 1031 of subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives on May 26, 2011, defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011. The term is not limited to those detained under the AUMF to cover detainees not deemed enemy belligerents by federal courts or administrative boards. The provision in H.R. 1540 does not limit the term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" to those held under the AUMF, potentially including detainees found not to be enemy belligerents. It is unclear who might be under the \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense without being in its custody as defined in the bill. The term \"effective control\" under the Department of Defense (DOD) in H.R. 1540 is ambiguous, especially regarding individuals not in DOD custody. The definition of \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broad, potentially including foreign nationals brought for non-hostility reasons. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. It is unclear if the provisions of H.R. 1540 regarding Guantanamo detainees apply to foreign refugees brought to the Migrant Operations Center at the Naval Station. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. It permits the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as military commission panel members vote unanimously to approve. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty if the accused pleads guilty and the panel votes unanimously. Section 1033 also addresses pre-trial agreements for sentence reduction but prohibits a military judge from imposing the death penalty alone. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, identifies parties involved, and affirms the President's authority to detain. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, affirming the President's authority to detain captured belligerents for the duration of hostilities. It states that the United States is engaged in an armed conflict with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, granting the President the authority to use necessary force under the AUMF. The President is authorized to use all necessary force during the armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The current armed conflict includes nations, organizations, and persons who are part of or supporting these entities engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents, including those engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, until the end of hostilities. This provision has sparked controversy, with supporters arguing it aligns with the 2001 AUMF and Congress's approval of executive actions. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents until the end of hostilities. Supporters argue it aligns with the 2001 AUMF, while opponents see it as authorizing an expansion of the armed conflict. The provision in H.R. 1540 regarding \"associated forces\" has sparked debate. Opponents fear it expands the armed conflict beyond the 9/11 nexus, while proponents argue it aligns with the broad discretion granted by the AUMF. Some view the removal of limits on identifying parties in the AUMF as significant, going beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict. Section 1034 includes not only Al Qaeda and the Taliban but also other nations, organizations, and persons engaged in hostilities against the United States. The AUMF includes Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US, as well as other entities that have supported hostilities. The requirement for entities in subparagraph 3(B) to engage in or support hostilities implies a connection to armed hostilities. The AUMF includes Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US, as well as entities that have supported hostilities. Subparagraph 3(B) requires a nexus to armed hostilities for entities to engage in or support hostilities. The use of the past tense suggests entities could be considered belligerents even if their support occurred before September 11, 2001, with no impact on the US. The AUMF includes Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US, as well as entities that have supported hostilities. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 indicates that Section 1034 is meant to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees, rather than expand the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 reaffirms the current interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in addressing the evolving threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the AUMF. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force to address the evolving threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. This affirmation does not limit the President's existing authority under the AUMF, and remains consistent with Congress's scope of authorities. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force aligns with Congress's scope of authorities. The term \"associated forces\" may not expand the authority beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF, as defined by the courts. The D.C. Circuit noted that the term \"associated\" in Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) could potentially expand the authority to use force beyond the AUMF. The language in paragraph (3) mirrors that used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detention purposes. The D.C. Circuit raised concerns about the interpretation of \"associated\" in Section 1034, which mirrors language used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detention purposes. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a framework. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it could create confusion regarding applicable standards. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The review process under Section 1036 for Guantanamo detainees involves military officers on the initial panel, strict criteria for detention assessment, and limits on private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on the process establishment. The Secretary of Defense is required to report to Congress within 180 days on the establishment of a review process for Guantanamo detainees to assess the necessity of continued detention. The process includes a full review every three years and a limited review of detainee files at least once a year. This review does not apply to detainees undergoing trial or serving a sentence by military commission. The review process for Guantanamo detainees includes a full review every three years and a limited review of detainee files at least once a year. The review is conducted by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism, and detainees are entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative.\" At Guantanamo, detainees undergo a review process every three years by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. The detainees are entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance. They can present a written or oral statement, introduce evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf. The detainee at Guantanamo undergoes a review process every three years by a panel of military officers. They can present evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. The detainee is provided with an unclassified summary of information before the hearing, and their personal representative receives a copy of the government's submission. The detainee at Guantanamo undergoes a review process every three years by a panel of military officers. They can present evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. The detainee is provided with a copy of the government's submission prior to the hearing, and outside parties may provide written submissions if authorized by the detainee. The limited annual file review considers new information regarding the threat posed by the individual, including mitigating information, which may lead to a full review by a military panel if warranted. The detainee at Guantanamo undergoes a review process every three years by a panel of military officers, considering new information regarding the threat posed by the individual. The military panel assesses factors such as the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity if transferred or released. The military panel reviews detainees at Guantanamo every three years to assess the threat they pose. Factors considered include the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, and potential intelligence value. The military panel at Guantanamo reviews detainees every three years to assess the threat they pose, considering factors like terrorist activity likelihood, ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, and intelligence value. Section 1036 mandates an interagency review board to oversee the panel's assessments for accuracy. The interagency review board, consisting of various government departments, is responsible for reviewing the military panel's assessments of Guantanamo detainees for accuracy. If the board disagrees with a recommendation, it can reject it by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board will find a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review panel identifies a suitable country for transferring detainees based on factors like the country's stance on terrorism, ability to control detention facilities, prosecute individuals, and ensure humane treatment. The criteria used by the panel is similar to that for Guantanamo transfer decisions. The interagency review panel ensures humane treatment of detainees and uses criteria similar to Guantanamo transfer decisions. A rejected recommendation may be reevaluated or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval. The detainee has no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House identified Section 1036 as a provision in H.R. 1540 that, along with other detainee provisions, could impact detainee decisions. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating that it could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on detainee decisions. The provision establishes a periodic review process that the White House believes undermines the President's Executive Order by limiting the input of intelligence and law enforcement professionals. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating that it could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on detainee decisions. The provision establishes a periodic review process that undermines the President's Executive Order by limiting input from intelligence and law enforcement professionals. Additionally, Section 1039 restricts the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, including those at Guantanamo, into the United States. Congress enacted funding measures to restrict executive discretion in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. Congress enacted funding measures to restrict executive discretion in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. Recent limitations, including those in the 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55), prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. The 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55) funding limitations prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US for criminal prosecution, making military commissions the primary forum for their trials. The 2012 Minibus funding restrictions prevent Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for trial, making military commissions the main forum for prosecution. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 expands these restrictions to cover a broader category of detainees until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 expands funding restrictions to cover a broader category of detainees, including those held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo. The restrictions prevent transfer or release of non-citizen detainees into the United States, but do not limit detainees from being brought into the country by another government agency. The restrictions imposed by H.R. 1540 prevent the DOD from transferring wartime detainees into the United States, but do not limit detainees from being brought into the country by another government agency. The restrictions expire at the end of FY2012, but other provisions of H.R. 1540, such as a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents for terrorist offenses in Article III courts, may continue beyond FY2012. The White House strongly objects to Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which restricts the release of detainees into the United States and interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts. This provision may eliminate the incentive for transferring wartime detainees into the country beyond FY2012. The Obama Administration opposes releasing detainees into the United States, citing interference with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in US courts. Section 1039 is seen as a threat to executive authority and national security, limiting counterterrorism efforts and undermining the use of Federal courts for dangerous individuals. The Obama Administration opposes releasing detainees into the United States, citing interference with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in US courts. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the use of funds for constructing or modifying facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees under the Department of Defense's control, limiting counterterrorism efforts and undermining national security. The 2012 Minibus restricts funds for constructing or modifying facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees under the Department of Defense's control. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring or releasing detainees to foreign countries, except under certain criteria or court orders. The 2012 Minibus restricts funds for constructing or modifying facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees under the Department of Defense's control. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring or releasing detainees to foreign countries, except under certain criteria or court orders. These restrictions mirror those in previous legislation and were set to expire in 2011. Section 1040 mirrors previous legislation regarding funding restrictions for transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees. Supporters argue it reduces the risk of recidivism, while critics say it hampers the executive's ability to transfer detainees. The restrictions on transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees are debated, with supporters citing reduced risk of recidivism and critics claiming they hinder the executive's ability to transfer detainees. No detainees have been transferred since the 2011 NDAA and CAA, and the impact of these restrictions on transfers is unclear. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur. The lack of subsequent detainee transfers is unclear due to restrictions under Section 1039, where the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur. The destination country must not be a state sponsor of terrorism, maintain control over detention facilities, and ensure the transferred person does not pose a future threat. The destination country must meet certain requirements to ensure the transferred detainee does not pose a future threat to the United States, its citizens, or its allies. This includes taking effective steps to prevent terrorism, sharing relevant information with the United States, and allowing access to appropriate agencies upon request. The destination country must meet requirements to prevent future threats to the US, its citizens, or allies. The certification requirements for transferring detainees are similar to those for Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The receiving country must agree to allow US authorities access to the transferred individual. The certification requirements for transferring detainees are similar to those for Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. Section 1040 adds a requirement for the receiving foreign entity to allow US authorities access to the transferred individual. The White House disapproves of the restrictions on detainee transfers imposed by Section 1040. The White House disapproves of restrictions on detainee transfers, claiming they interfere with the executive's ability to make important foreign policy and national security determinations. The Administration argues for broad flexibility in negotiations with foreign countries. Section 1035 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit detailed national security information. The Administration argues for broad flexibility in negotiations with foreign countries regarding detainee transfers. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol within 90 days, outlining limitations and privileges for Guantanamo detainees. The protocol required for Guantanamo detainees must outline limitations and privileges regarding legal representation, communication, information receipt, contraband possession, and enforcement measures. It must also include monitoring procedures to protect national security while preserving the detainee's privilege for legal materials and communications during military commission trials or habeas proceedings. Section 1038 prohibits the use of DOD funds in FY2012 to allow family members access. Section 1043 prohibits repatriated Guantanamo detainees in Micronesia, Palau, or Marshall Islands from receiving rights under the Compact of Free Association. The Compact of Free Association prohibits repatriated Guantanamo detainees in Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands from receiving certain rights and benefits, including travel to the United States. This provision may not apply to former detainees resettled in these countries, such as the Chinese ethnic Uighur detainees in Palau. Section 1043 of the Compact of Free Association applies to citizens of Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands who were detained at Guantanamo and returned to their country. Section 1042 requires consultation before prosecution. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for certain offenses, determining whether to proceed in a U.S. district court or before a military commission, and considering transfer to military custody for intelligence interviews. This provision is new to defense authorization bills. Section 1042 in the defense authorization bill requires consultation among officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for specific offenses and deciding on the venue for prosecution. The White House opposes this provision, arguing that it could disrupt existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related cases and cause delays in apprehending individuals posing immediate threats. Section 1042 in the defense authorization bill requires consultation before prosecuting non-citizens for specific offenses, which the White House opposes, arguing it could disrupt coordination in terrorism cases and cause delays in apprehending immediate threats. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct be tried by military commission. Section 1046 of the defense authorization bill mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct be tried by military commission, without clearly defining the terms used in the provision. It is unclear if the provision would apply to prospective attacks that are never carried out. It is unclear whether the provision in the defense authorization bill would apply to prospective terrorist attacks that are not carried out, as the definition of a \"terrorist attack\" is not clarified. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. The provision in the defense authorization bill may cover failed attacks, such as the attempted destruction of an airliner in 2009. To be applicable, the attack must be deemed to have occurred within the United States or involve U.S. government property or personnel. Additionally, the offense related to the attack must be trialable by military commission under the MCA, and the accused must fall under its jurisdiction. The offense related to the attack must be trialable by military commission under the MCA, and the accused must fall under its jurisdiction. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft seems amenable to prosecution under criminal prohibitions within military commission jurisdiction, as long as the offense was committed in the context of hostilities. In order for a military commission to have jurisdiction over an accused, it must be established that the offense was committed in the context of hostilities and the accused is not a U.S. citizen but an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This requires some connection between the accused and the opposing forces in an armed conflict. To apply Section 1042, a military commission must establish that the accused is not a U.S. citizen and is an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill outlines criteria for determining an unprivileged enemy belligerent, including engaging in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supporting hostilities, or being part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. Military commissions or Article III courts could make jurisdictional determinations under the provision. The bill outlines criteria for determining an unprivileged enemy belligerent, including engaging in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supporting hostilities, or being part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. Military commissions or Article III courts could make jurisdictional determinations under the provision. The provision could complicate efforts to extradite terrorism suspects from abroad or to try those who have already been extradited. The provision in the bill outlines criteria for determining an unprivileged enemy belligerent, potentially complicating efforts to extradite or try terrorism suspects. It may only apply to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and does not require government action unless specified in Section 1042. The provision in the bill outlines criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerents in U.S. custody. It does not require government action unless specified in Section 1042. The bill does not preclude trials in Article III courts for the individuals it describes, but states they shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. The bill does not preclude trials in Article III courts for certain individuals, but specifies they can only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. This allows for broader discretion in prosecutorial decisions by the executive branch officials. The bill allows for trials in Article III courts for certain individuals, but limits them to specific offenses in military commissions. Section 1042 grants executive branch officials broader discretion in prosecutorial decisions compared to Section 1046. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the jurisdiction of the Article III court. If the court agrees and there are obstacles to a military commission trial, such as extradition issues, a criminal trial may not be possible. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance in military operations outside the US for two years. There is criticism from executive branch officials regarding constraints on prosecuting detainees in military courts. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance in military operations outside the US for two years, with rewards up to $5 million. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations, including legal issues. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations, including legal issues and limitations. Section 1044 approves DOD anti-terrorism efforts and pledges congressional support. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and strengthen \"at-risk states,\" requiring the President to issue planning guidance. Section 1045 requires the President to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, as well as strengthening \"at-risk states.\" The guidance must identify geographic areas of concern, set goals for each area, describe agency roles, and address gaps in U.S. capabilities. The President must submit copies of the guidance to Congress within 15 days of completion or update. The President is required to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, as well as strengthening \"at-risk states.\" The guidance must be reviewed and updated as necessary, with copies submitted to Congress within 15 days. Agencies involved must enter into a memorandum of understanding covering specific criteria. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, similar to provisions in S. 1253 but with revisions to address Administration concerns. S. 1867 was passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with detainee provisions similar to S. 1253 but revised to address Administration concerns. An amendment clarified that the bill's affirmation of legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda did not affect existing authorities regarding U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with detainee provisions from S. 1867, affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. This did not impact existing authorities for U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents, including those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The earlier version of Section 1031 in S. 1253 also authorized the Armed Forces to detain individuals captured in the course of hostilities. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The earlier version of Section 1031 in S. 1253 authorized the Armed Forces to detain individuals captured in the course of hostilities, but the White House objected to limiting detentions to those captured during military operations. The White House objected to language in the Senate-passed bill regarding detainee dispositions under the law of war, which may include detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. The Senate bill allows for detainee dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. Section 1031 of the bill does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 provides that nothing in Section 1031 limits or expands the President's authority or the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. It tacitly leaves the application of the AUMF to U.S. persons, including citizens and resident aliens. The revised provision of S. 1867 tacitly leaves the application of the AUMF to U.S. persons, reinforcing the executive branch's view of detention authority. The potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and other persons within the United States is unsettled. The committee-modified version of the bill aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority under the AUMF. There was significant debate on whether Section 1031 could apply to U.S. citizens within the country. An amendment to prevent long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was rejected, but a proviso was added to clarify that existing laws relating to the detention of U.S. citizens remain unaffected. An amendment was adopted to clarify that Section 1031 does not affect existing laws regarding the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens, emphasizing that the executive's authority remains unchanged. Section 1031 does not expand or limit the executive's authority to detain individuals in the United States, including U.S. citizens and resident aliens. The Supreme Court has recognized the detention of individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but the rules for preventive military detention in other locations remain unclear. The circumstances of preventive military detention for individuals captured in locations other than Afghanistan have not been definitively adjudicated, including U.S. citizens and resident aliens. The rules for detention under the AUMF for individuals captured or arrested in the United States have also not been definitively clarified. The AUMF does not definitively clarify the circumstances for detaining individuals captured in the United States. Section 1031 does not provide additional clarification on terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces.\" The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies, including with respect to \"organizations, entities, and individuals considered to be 'covered persons' under section 1031(b).\" This may require an ongoing accounting of entities considered \"associated forces\" or a description of what constitutes \"substantial support.\" The Administration has not raised specific objections to the language in revised Section 1031. The Administration has not raised specific objections to the language in revised Section 1031, although it believes codification of existing authorities is \"unnecessary and poses some risk.\" Congress must be careful not to open new legal questions that could distract from efforts to protect the country. Future legislative action should ensure that codification of military detention authority does not have unintended consequences compromising national security. Future legislative action must ensure that codification of military detention authority does not compromise national security. Section 1032 requires military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, but not all covered persons under Section 1031. Al Qaeda members and \"associated forces\" captured by the United States within 60 days of enactment must be detained, excluding U.S. citizens. The provision applies to U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities, with detention limited by the Constitution. The mandatory detention requirement applies to covered persons captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, defining \"covered persons\" as individuals associated with al-Qaeda who have participated in planning or carrying out attacks against the United States. Detention is mandated for non-U.S. resident aliens, with limitations based on the Constitution. The mandatory detention requirement applies to individuals associated with al-Qaeda who have participated in planning or carrying out attacks against the United States. These individuals may be held in military detention until hostilities under the AUMF are terminated, tried before a military commission, or transferred to another country. The detainee can be held in military detention until hostilities end, tried before a military commission, transferred to another court, or to a foreign government if transfer requirements are met. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" and defines detention. The transfer requirements in Section 1033 of the bill are satisfied. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" who act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda. The omission of any reference to the Taliban in Section 1032 suggests it need not be treated as a force associated with Al Qaeda unless its actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. The omission of any reference to the Taliban in Section 1032 of the bill suggests that it need not be treated as a force associated with Al Qaeda unless its actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. This raises questions about how to determine if an associated force acts independently but coordinates some activities with Al Qaeda, and whether all members would be subject to mandatory detention. The determination of whether an individual should be subject to mandatory detention under Section 1032 of the bill may depend on their involvement in activities coordinated with Al Qaeda. This raises questions about how to differentiate between Taliban insurgents and members who are directly involved in planning attacks with Al Qaeda. The bill's Section 1032 mandates detention for Taliban members involved in planning attacks with Al Qaeda, but not for \"lone wolf\" terrorists. The definition of \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is unclear, potentially limited to attacks in military operations. The provision in the bill allows for the military detention of persons captured during hostilities, potentially including attacks on armed forces in a military theater of operations. The interpretation of \"attack\" is unclear, especially regarding terrorist acts against civilian targets. The application of the law of war to such circumstances is uncertain. The provision in the bill allows for the military detention of persons captured during hostilities, including attacks on armed forces in a military theater of operations. The application of the law of war to such circumstances is uncertain, especially regarding terrorist acts against civilian targets. The reference to the possibility of detaining lawful resident aliens based on conduct in the United States supports a broader interpretation of \"attack.\" The mandatory detention requirement is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF and may not apply to insurgents attacking U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. The provision in S. 1867 allows for military detention of persons captured during hostilities authorized by the AUMF. It may not apply to insurgents attacking U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. The bill includes a new requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment detailing procedures for implementing the provision. This includes designating who can determine a covered person and the process for making such determinations. The submission for the provision in S. 1867 must include procedures for designating authorized personnel to determine covered persons, preventing interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering, and ensuring no interference with ongoing interrogation sessions. Additionally, the provision should not apply to individuals in the custody of a third country. The provision in S. 1867 includes procedures for determining covered persons, preventing interruption of interrogation sessions, and allowing waiver authority for transferring individuals from third countries. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036. The bill includes procedures for determining covered persons, preventing interrogation session interruptions, and allowing waiver authority for transferring individuals from a third country. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036, which requires DOD to submit procedures for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF. If Section 1036 procedures are meant to determine detainability under the AUMF initially, it should happen before determining if detention is required under Section 1032. The bill does not prevent implementation. The bill does not preclude multiple processes for determining if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention or the use of a single procedure to determine detainability under Section 1032 and the appropriate disposition under the law of war. The bill allows for various processes to determine if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1032, potentially implicating constitutional due process requirements and habeas corpus challenges. It does not prevent Article III trials for covered persons, but time spent in military custody could complicate the process. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, as it could complicate the prosecution of covered defendants and restrict the executive branch's counterterrorism tools, according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Leon Panetta opposes Section 1032 of the bill, expressing doubt that it benefits DOD or U.S. national security interests. He believes it would limit the executive branch's use of counterterrorism tools and criticizes its lack of clarity on limiting scope to persons captured abroad. Panetta also objects to the qualification on \"associated force\" and views the extension of transfer certification requirements as inappropriate. The White House strongly opposes Section 1032 of the bill, calling it an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. They believe it would hinder intelligence and law enforcement professionals and complicate the Department's ability to interpret and implement the restriction. The Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, citing it as a controversial restriction on the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. They doubt that committee revisions will address the fundamental problems perceived. The Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, stating that committee revisions do not address the fundamental problems perceived. The revised text directs the President to develop procedures to prevent issues arising from the requirement, conceding the risks without a sufficient solution. This could lead to confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on the use of military custody for the fiscal year. Section 1033 extends restrictions on the use of military custody for the fiscal year, posing risks without a clear solution, potentially causing confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 in the 2011 NDAA and CAA, as well as H.R. 1540, prohibits DOD funds for Guantanamo detainee transfers without certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the destination country or entity meets certain criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the destination country or entity meets certain criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees. The certification requirements include taking effective measures to avert any threat posed by the individual, preventing engagement in terrorism, and sharing relevant information with the United States. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the receiving foreign entity allows U.S. access to transferred detainees. Certification is not needed for detainees transferred under certain conditions. Section 1033 prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries or entities. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify transfers of detainees to foreign entities. Section 1033 prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries or entities, except for detainees under pretrial agreements or court orders. Transfers are allowed unless there is a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity after transfer. The certification requirement and bar on recidivism may be waived for detainees being transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, can waive these requirements if alternative actions will address the risks or substantially mitigate them. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, can waive the certification requirement and bar on recidivism for detainees being transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders. Alternative actions must be taken to address or substantially mitigate risks, and any transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States. Copies of the determination and waiver must be submitted to the congressional defense committees 30 days prior to the transfer. The Secretary of Defense can waive certification and recidivism requirements for detainees being transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders. Transfers must be in the national security interests of the United States, with copies of the determination and waiver submitted to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions under the 2012 NDAA apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It remains to be seen if the scope includes foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center. Section 1033 requirements also apply to individuals subject to transfer. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions under the 2012 NDAA apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It remains to be seen if the scope includes foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center. Section 1033 requirements also apply to individuals subject to transfer. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of certain provisions in the NDAA. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to house Guantanamo Bay detainees in the US without congressional authorization. The 2012 NDAA includes a provision (Section 1034) that restricts the use of Department of Defense funds to house Guantanamo Bay detainees in the US without congressional authorization. This restriction is similar to previous years and the White House has objected to it. The 2012 NDAA includes a provision (Section 1034) that restricts the use of Department of Defense funds to house Guantanamo Bay detainees in the US without congressional authorization. Unlike previous years, the Senate bill allows for the transfer of detainees to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prohibit executive authorities from releasing detainees. The 2012 NDAA restricts the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees into the US without congressional authorization. However, detainees can be transferred to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution. Executive authorities are not prohibited from releasing cleared detainees into the US. The only restriction in the Senate bill is on transfers for continued military detention. Section 1035 addresses Executive Order 13567 on detention reviews. The Senate bill restricts transfers of Guantanamo detainees to the US for continued military detention. Section 1035 clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days outlining review panel procedures. Section 1035 of the Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days outlining review panel procedures, emphasizing that the purpose of the periodic review is to determine if a detainee poses a continuing threat to U.S. security, and that the final decision to release or transfer a detainee rests with the Secretary of Defense. The Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. The Secretary of Defense, after considering the results and recommendations of a reviewing panel, is responsible for any final decision to release or transfer a detainee and is not bound by the recommendations. Factors considered include the likelihood of the detainee resuming terrorist activity, family or government support, trial by military commission, and law enforcement interest. The Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. Factors considered include the likelihood of the detainee resuming terrorist activity, family or government support, trial by military commission, and law enforcement interest. The Administration objects to a provision in the bill that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF. Section 1036 of the Senate bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, specifically regarding the status of persons detained under the AUMF for purposes of Section 1031. It is unclear whether this determination refers to identifying a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or the disposition of such individuals under the law of war. Additionally, procedures for long-term detention of unprivileged enemy belligerents must include specific elements according to clause (b) of the provision. The provision in Section 1031 requires procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents held in long-term detention, including the presence of a military judge and the option for military counsel representation. These requirements apply regardless of the detainee's location. The provision in Section 1031 mandates procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents held in long-term detention, allowing military counsel representation. This applies regardless of the detainee's location and could provide detainees in Afghanistan more privileges during status determination hearings. The impact on Guantanamo detainees, previously labeled as \"enemy combatants,\" remains unclear. The provision in Section 1031 mandates procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents held in long-term detention, allowing military counsel representation. It is unclear how this provision would affect detainees currently held at Guantanamo, designated as \"enemy combatants\" without full compliance with Section 1036(b) requirements. The implications of Section 1036 on habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees are also uncertain. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges are uncertain, as it is unclear if the provision applies to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or only to those detained after the Senate bill's enactment. The provision does not clarify how new captures will be determined prior to a status hearing. The provision in Section 1036 of the bill is unclear on whether it applies to all detainees designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or only to those detained after the Senate bill's enactment. It does not specify how new captures will be determined prior to a status hearing. The bill's provision regarding long-term detention of enemy belligerents is ambiguous, as it does not clarify if it applies to all detainees under the AUMF or only those captured after the bill's enactment. It also raises questions about the process for determining new captures before a status hearing. The bill's provision on long-term detention of enemy belligerents raises questions about the process for determining new captures before a status hearing. Captured individuals destined for trial or transfer may not be entitled to military counsel or a military judge at their status determination proceedings. Multiple status determinations may be held for those subject to long-term detention to change their disposition. The bill's provision on long-term detention of enemy belligerents raises questions about the process for determining new captures before a status hearing. Captured individuals may be transferred to another country or prosecuted without involving a military judge or right to counsel. The status review process under Section 1036 may only apply to detainees designated for long-term detention, while others may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The bill's provision on long-term detention of enemy belligerents raises questions about the process for determining new captures before a status hearing. Detainees not designated for long-term detention may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The White House disapproves of this provision, citing conflicts with established detainee review procedures. Section 1037 allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. Section 1037 of the bill allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540."
