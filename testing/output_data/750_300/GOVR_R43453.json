    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount for 2017 and 2018 is 2.4 cents per kWh, adjusted annually for inflation. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount. The renewable electricity PTC offers a tax credit of 2.4 cents per kWh for qualified energy resources. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount, while other technologies receive a reduced credit. Nonwind facilities starting construction before January 1, 2018, may also qualify for the PTC. Under current law, nonwind facilities starting construction before January 1, 2018, may qualify for a reduced credit amount. The credit for wind facilities is available for those starting construction before January 1, 2020, with reductions based on the year of construction. The PTC expiration date used to be a placed-in-service deadline before 2013. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is reduced by 40% for facilities starting construction in 2018 and by 60% for facilities starting construction in 2019. The PTC amount may phase out once electricity market prices exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. The PTC is not likely to be phased out under current law. In the past, the ability to claim the PTC was also limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has not been phased out despite market prices not exceeding threshold levels. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), which was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision, allowing unused credits to offset future tax liability. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the energy investment tax credit or an ARRA Section 1603 grant for property placed in service from 2009 to 2011. Additionally, there are production tax credits for Indian coal and refined products. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant was available for properties placed in service during 2009, 2010, or 2011. Production tax credits are also available for Indian coal and refined coal, with a base rate of $2.00 per ton for Indian coal. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal have specific base rates and inflation adjustments. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. Refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, with a 10-year production period allowed. The PTC was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92; P.L. 102-486) and has been extended 11 times since 1999. Initially available for wind and closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC has been extended multiple times after lapsing before being reinstated. Refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, with a 10-year production period allowed. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92; P.L. 102-486) and has been extended multiple times since then. Initially available for wind and closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC has been extended several times, including adding poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The PTC was extended through December 31, 2005, with subsequent modifications made by later legislation. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through December 31, 2005, with new qualifying resources added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. These resources included open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. The PTC period for these new resources was limited to five years. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) through December 31, 2005, adding new qualifying resources such as open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources had a five-year PTC period, with some credits reduced by half. Additionally, a PTC for refined coal was introduced at a rate of $4.375 per ton, available until January 1, 2009. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress, except for facilities under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2007 for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal. Two new qualifying resources, hydropower and Indian coal, were added with specific credit amounts over a seven-year period. The credit period was also extended from 5 years to. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2007 for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation. The PTC was further extended and modified in subsequent legislation. The PTC was extended through 2008 for most facilities except solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The PTC was further extended and modified in 2008, with wind and refined coal extended through 2009, and other resources extended through 2010. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were added as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 extended the production tax credit (PTC) for solid waste and qualified hydropower through 2010. It also added marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel set at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. This credit was available for facilities producing steel industry fuel on or before October 1, 2008, with different timelines for eligibility based on the date the facility was placed in service. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the production tax credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the production tax credit (PTC) for wind through 2013. Provisions in ARRA allowed taxpayers to elect a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. The Section 1603 grant program provided a one-time payment in lieu of tax credits for eligible taxpayers. The program was available for property placed in service in 2009 or 2010 and was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Section 1603 grant program through 2011. The PTC for wind was further extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The PTC and ITC were extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The PATH Act of 2015 extended the PTC for nonwind facilities through 2016, along with the ITC option. Indian coal facilities also had their production credit extended through 2016. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019 at current rates through 2016. The ITC in lieu of PTC option was also extended through 2016. Indian coal facilities had their production credit extended through 2016, with the placed-in-service limitation removed. Wind facilities beginning construction in 2017 will see a 20% reduction in the credit. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Nonwind technologies and Indian coal credits were retroactively extended for tax year 2017. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Without further legislative action, these credits will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses for the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are $25.8 billion, with most of the losses attributed to wind energy. Other sources of revenue losses include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses from the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for most of the losses. Other sources of revenue losses include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. Additionally, JCT's tax expenditure estimates show $0.3 billion for PTCs for open-loop biomass, $0.1 billion for PTCs for municipal solid waste, and $0.1 billion for PTCs for qualified hydropower. The estimated revenue losses for refined coal and Indian coal are $0.1 billion each. Information on PTC claims by corporations is available from the IRS, with 230 corporate taxpayers claiming the PTC in 2013. For 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the Production Tax Credit (PTC) totaling $2.8 billion, mainly for renewable electricity production. Unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future years. In 2010, $1.2 billion in Production Tax Credits (PTCs) were carried forward from previous tax years, reflecting the impact of policy actions in response to the economic downturn on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with fewer taxpayers opting for the PTC due to the availability of the Section 1603 grant option. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with a decrease in PTC claims after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants were claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The effect of the downturn is also seen in data on tax credit carry forwards. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with a decrease in PTC claims after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. The amount of PTCs being carried forward more than doubled between 2008 and 2009, then doubled again between 2009 and 2010. Taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits during the downturn, and weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with a decrease in PTC claims after 2009 due to Section 1603 grants. Taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits. Weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits. Estimates show the cost of a long-term PTC extension, with reductions in federal revenues for various technologies. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit and wind construction start date would reduce federal revenues by $7.3 billion between 2018 and 2028. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, and its extension in 1999 was to further develop environmentally friendly renewable power. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended in 1999 to promote renewable energy sources and drive investment in the wind industry. Recent extensions reflect a belief that the PTC contributes to the development of renewable energy infrastructure, aligning with environmental and energy policy goals. Further extension may lead to additional investment and growth in wind infrastructure, although potential is limited in some cases. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, aligning with environmental goals. Further extension may lead to more investment, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. The PTC has increased renewable electricity use, but its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has increased renewable electricity use, but its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Research shows that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. Renewable energy tax credit extensions contribute to reduced emissions, especially with low natural gas prices. Government intervention in energy markets is often justified by the presence of externalities. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that tax credits for wind and solar help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is often necessary due to externalities like pollution, which result in market failures. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option for addressing inefficiencies and market failures in the energy sector. However, subsidies may not be the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective as they can encourage energy consumption, counter energy conservation initiatives, and offset emissions reductions. Tax subsidies in the energy sector may not be the most efficient way to achieve policy objectives. They reduce energy costs, encourage consumption, counter conservation efforts, and offset emissions reductions. Additionally, they may not provide equal incentives for all emission reduction alternatives and can reduce tax revenues, leading to economic inefficiency. A more direct and economically efficient approach is needed to address pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector. Tax subsidies in the energy sector reduce tax revenues and economic efficiency. A more efficient approach would be a direct tax on pollution, like a carbon tax, which could generate revenues to offset other taxes and address environmental concerns. This approach is technology neutral and avoids the need for Congress to select technologies to subsidize. A carbon tax approach is more efficient than tax incentives for delivering federal financial support to renewable energy developers and investors. Tax equity financing arrangements with outside investors reduce direct federal financial support to the renewable energy sector. The use of tax equity investors reduces federal financial support for renewable energy, incentivizing production over investment. Interaction with other policies like Renewable Portfolio Standards is a key consideration. The PTC, along with other renewable energy policies, supports the development of renewable electricity resources. Many states have RPS policies in place, and federal subsidies like the PTC help reduce compliance costs. The PTC is not available for nonwind projects starting after December 31, 2017, or wind projects after December 31, 2019. Options include letting the PTC expire or extending it for projects meeting specified construction start dates. One option is to allow the PTC to expire as scheduled for wind projects starting after December 31, 2019. Another option is to provide a temporary extension of the PTC, potentially retroactive for 2018, for nonwind technologies. Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies with a deadline extension for construction start dates. Enactment of P.L. 114-113 resulted in different expiration dates for the PTC for wind and other technologies. Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies, potentially retroactive for 2018. Options include applying the phaseout currently for wind to other technologies or removing the phaseout for wind to have all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in his tax reform proposal. In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout as part of his tax reform proposal. The proposal aimed to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for all eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would have affected facilities that received a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014 and were still within their 10-year PTC window in 2015. Chairman Camp's proposal in 2014 aimed to reduce the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would have resulted in a decrease from the previous 2.3 cent per kWh PTC. The proposal also included a full repeal of the PTC after 2024, with an estimated $9.6 billion increase in federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. The JCT estimated that a proposal to reduce the PTC for existing facilities would have raised $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and adding solar facilities as qualifying property. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify. The PTC and ITC for renewable energy would be made permanent, with solar facilities added as qualifying property. Renewable electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits, and solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify. The JCT estimated that these changes would cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
