    "content": "The text chunk is about the codification of effective dates for claims under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The text chunk provides definitions related to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including the terms 'claimant', 'claim', and 'formal claim'. The text chunk defines 'formal claim' as a claim submitted on a prescribed application form and 'informal claim' as a written communication indicating belief in entitlement to benefits. The text chunk outlines the requirements for a claim to be considered as a formal claim under the laws administered by the Secretary. The text chunk defines a \"reasonably raised claim\" as evidence of entitlement to a benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary, not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. The term 'reasonably raised claim' refers to evidence of entitlement to a benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary, not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. Upon receipt of an informal claim, the Secretary must provide the claimant with an application form for a formal claim. Informal requests for claim increase or reopening are treated the same as formal claims. The Secretary must keep a dated copy of the letter accompanying the application form in the claim file. An informal request for claim increase or reopening is treated the same as a formal claim. The date of receipt of an application is considered to be the date of an informal communication. The Secretary considers an application to be filed on the date of an informal communication relating to the benefit, as long as the formal application is submitted within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. The Secretary considers an application to be filed within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. If the application is not filed by then, it will be considered filed on the date the completed form is submitted. The Secretary shall identify, address, and adjudicate reasonably raised claims that are placed at issue in the course of addressing or adjudicating any claim, including evidence relating to entirely separate conditions never identified as part of a formal claim. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and will apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
