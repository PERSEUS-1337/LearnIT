    "content": "The Navy scheduled 14 training exercises off the coast of southern California involving mid-frequency active sonar to detect enemy submarines. Environmentalists claim the sonar harms whales, causing beach strandings. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The Navy conducted training exercises using mid-frequency active sonar off the coast of southern California, with environmental groups seeking relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction, later modified to allow the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, emphasizing the importance of mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed a modified preliminary injunction allowing the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating they had shown a \"possibility\" of irreparable injury. The Supreme Court ruled on November 12, 2008, that the Ninth Circuit's \"possibility\" test for a preliminary injunction is too lenient. The majority opinion held that plaintiffs must show that irreparable injury is \"likely\" in the absence of an injunction. However, the Court found that the Navy's interest in effective training outweighed any potential harm to the plaintiffs, leading to the denial of injunctive relief. The Court found that the Navy's interest in effective training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals, leading to denial of injunctive relief and vacating the preliminary injunction. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit. The Court vacated the preliminary injunction, citing a national security interest in the Navy's training exercises. The decision did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding potential violations of environmental laws. The Court vacated a preliminary injunction due to national security concerns regarding the Navy's training exercises, indicating that a final injunction should also be rejected if environmental violations are found. The Ninth Circuit's test for injunctions was rejected by the Supreme Court in this case. The Supreme Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions, which is known for being environmentally friendly. The Court vacated a preliminary injunction due to national security concerns regarding the Navy's training exercises. The Forest Service promulgated regulations under the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act. The Forest Service promulgated regulations under the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act, which precluded notice, comment, and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. Salvage timber sales of 250 acres or less were designated as categorical exclusions, leading to a timber sale of 238 acres of post-fire forest that was not subject to appeal. The Forest Service approved a timber sale of 238 acres of post-fire forest as a categorical exclusion, not subject to appeal. The district court invalidated the regulations, leading to a nationwide injunction. The Ninth Circuit ruled that plaintiffs had standing due to deprivation of procedural rights and reduced recreational enjoyment. The Ninth Circuit in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687 (9th Cir. 2007), found plaintiffs had standing due to injury in fact and ripeness of claims against the appeal prohibition. The court also ruled that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA and affirmed the district court's decision. The Ninth Circuit found that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA and affirmed the district court's decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Forest Service's promulgation of these regulations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Forest Service's promulgation of regulations, focusing on questions of judicial review, standing, ripeness, and the Ninth Circuit's affirmation of a nationwide injunction. The Supreme Court is reviewing the Forest Service's regulations, with questions on judicial review, standing, ripeness, and a nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, and the outcome could have significant implications. Environmental groups have long used site-specific challenges for program-wide reform. A defeat in this decision could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate government programs. The Court's conservative justices may rule restrictively, impacting the role of courts. The Court's conservative justices may rule restrictively on the Clean Water Act section 316(b), which addresses the killing or injuring of billions of aquatic organisms by industrial operations withdrawing water from waterways. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the harm caused to aquatic organisms by industrial water intake structures. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule governing cooling water intake structures at existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule governing cooling water intake structures at existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine whether CWA section 316(b) allows for cost considerations in selecting technology for minimizing environmental impact. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to consider costs in selecting technology for minimizing environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. In the 1970s, there was resistance to cost-benefit analysis in federal environmental laws. The Supreme Court case argued in December 2008 will test the shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in federal environmental laws. The decision could impact business concerns and industry's perspective on environmental protection. The Supreme Court case in December 2008 will test the shift towards acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in federal environmental laws. Industry may welcome a decision legitimizing cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and federal pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's past views on government regulation and cost considerations have also been highlighted in this case. Justice Breyer's past views on government regulation and cost considerations are highlighted in the case involving Coeur Alaska's proposal to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. The company plans to dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, sparking debate on the consideration of costs in environmental laws. Coeur Alaska plans to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act in 2005, leading to a legal challenge in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit in 2005 under the Clean Water Act for Coeur Alaska's gold mine project in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. In Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding the discharge of \"fill material\" into U.S. waters from the mine. The permit was issued despite the potential impact on aquatic life. The Corps and EPA define \"fill material\" as material changing water bottom elevation. Discharge from Coeur's gold mine alters water bottom, 404 permit issued. EPA prohibits discharges from Coeur Alaska's ore processing into US waters. CWA requires this prohibition in mill's NPDES permit. Court finds CWA mandates incorporation of prohibition. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act requires Coeur Alaska's gold mine to incorporate a prohibition on discharging ore processing waste into US waters through its NPDES permit. The court found that there is no exemption from performance standards under Section 404, even if the discharge meets the definition of \"fill material.\" EPA and the Corps did not intend for waste products subject to performance standards to be regulated as fill material. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act requires Coeur Alaska's gold mine to incorporate a prohibition on discharging ore processing waste into US waters through its NPDES permit. The court found that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material, and the Corps should not have issued a 404 permit in this case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps to the EPA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008 to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a potential reversal could be significant, as it may give the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from the EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving the reallocation of permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The potential consequences of a reversal could be significant if the Court allows the Corps to redefine \"fill material\" and remove discharges from the EPA's NPDES program. EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at a chemical facility. The EPA and the state sued various parties under CERCLA for cleanup costs at a contaminated site, including a defunct company, railroads, and Shell Oil Co. The EPA and the state sued multiple parties under CERCLA for cleanup costs at a contaminated site. The district court found the railroads and Shell Oil Co. liable for a percentage of the total cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of the railroads and Shell Oil Co. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit found the railroads liable for 9% of total cleanup costs and Shell liable for 6%. The court determined that the contamination could be apportioned as some occurred before the railroads' parcel was part of the facility. Neither the railroads nor Shell provided sufficient evidence to shift liability. The court found the railroads liable for 9% of cleanup costs and Shell liable for 6%. The contamination could be apportioned as some occurred before the railroads' parcel was part of the facility. Neither party provided sufficient evidence for apportionment or to shift liability. The court also addressed Shell's liability as an \"arranger,\" stating it is not limited to direct arranger liability. The court found Shell liable for 6% of cleanup costs due to its role as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA, which includes broader liability for transactions involving disposal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the matter in 2008. Shell arranged a transaction with leakage or disposal, leading to arranger liability. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2008 to address the Ninth Circuit's decision on CERCLA responsibility apportionment and review standards conflicting with common law principles. Shell Oil's petition questions liability for arranging hazardous substance disposal under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2008 to address the Ninth Circuit's decision on CERCLA responsibility apportionment and review standards conflicting with common law principles. Shell Oil's petition questions liability for arranging hazardous substance disposal under CERCLA, departing from common law principles and conflicting with decisions of other circuits. The case was argued on February 24, 2009. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2008 to address CERCLA responsibility apportionment and review standards conflicting with common law principles. The case raised fundamental Superfund Act issues, questioning liability for arranging hazardous substance disposal under CERCLA. The heart of the Superfund statute is its expansive liability scheme designed by Congress to maximize solvent responsible parties' likelihood of being held accountable. The Supreme Court case Burlington Northern raises crucial issues regarding liability under the Superfund statute, particularly in determining a reasonable basis for apportioning liability among parties. This case could significantly impact how often parties are held jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs. The Supreme Court case Burlington Northern raises crucial issues regarding liability under the Superfund statute. Parties may be jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs unless a reasonable basis for apportioning liability is established. The Court's decision on what constitutes a reasonable basis could impact the government's ability to recover costs. If a lax standard is adopted, the federal treasury may have to absorb more cleanup costs. The Supreme Court case Burlington Northern raises crucial issues regarding liability under the Superfund statute. If the Court adopts a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability than the Ninth Circuit, there could be fewer parties in the pool of potential defendants, increasing the likelihood that the federal treasury would have to cover some cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about the liability of manufacturers in selling products that may not involve obvious disposal arrangements. The Supreme Court cases regarding liability under the Superfund statute are important for industry and the environmental community. The Navy sonar case is likely to attract media attention, but all cases have significance for their programs and legal implications. The direction of the Roberts Court on environmental issues is being closely watched, with industry optimistic and environmental groups cautious. The Supreme Court cases on liability under the Superfund statute are significant for industry and the environmental community. The direction of the Roberts Court on environmental issues is closely watched, with industry optimistic and environmental groups cautious about the outcomes of the cases. The Supreme Court's environmental decisions may differ from appellate courts, especially with cases from the Ninth Circuit which has a high reversal rate. The Supreme Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases. Today's Supreme Court is generally less tolerant of regulation. The Supreme Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases. Today's Supreme Court is generally less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns. The large number of environmental cases this term may be due to random certiorari-granting processes or conservative justices recognizing potential cases. The increase in environmental cases this term may be attributed to random certiorari-granting processes, conservative justices anticipating potential cases, and prominent Supreme Court practitioners showing more interest in these cases. The most eminent Supreme Court practitioners are increasingly involved in environmental cases, potentially influencing the Court's acceptance of such cases. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court continues to reject cases related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, including questions about the Commerce Clause and the geographic scope of the laws. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, but it is likely due to the majority of petitions being turned down. The Supreme Court rejects cases related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, including questions about the Commerce Clause and geographic scope. The majority of certiorari petitions are turned down, possibly because the same justices from the 2006 Rapanos case remain, leading to confusion in lower courts. If a post-Rapanos case were accepted now, a similar lack of consensus among justices may result."
