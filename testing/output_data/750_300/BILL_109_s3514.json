    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Number Online Protection Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the display of social security numbers has led to illegal activities like fraud and identity theft, impacting interstate commerce and public safety. The government mandates social security numbers for tax purposes, benefits eligibility, and employment. The requirement for individuals in the United States to have a social security account number for tax, benefits, and employment purposes has inadvertently led to the misuse of these numbers for criminal activities and privacy breaches. The Federal Government should take steps to prevent the misuse of social security numbers for crime and privacy violations, as public documents in many jurisdictions are required to be accessible to the general public. In most US jurisdictions, public documents like business filings and birth certificates must be available to the public, potentially exposing social security numbers. Increasingly, these records are being stored online, improving access but also raising privacy risks. Public records stored online by repositories like Secretary of State's office or local clerk's office increase access but also raise the risk of social security numbers being misused. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DISPLAYING LAST 4 DIGITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ONLINE BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. Amend Title 18, U.S. Code to prohibit public display of these digits. State and local governments are prohibited from displaying the last 4 digits of social security account numbers on the internet. This rule does not override any existing restrictions on displaying social security numbers online. The last 4 digits of social security account numbers cannot be displayed on the internet by State and local governments. This rule does not supersede any existing restrictions on displaying social security numbers online. Noncompliance with this rule may result in civil penalties imposed by the Attorney General. \"States or political subdivisions facing substantial noncompliance with internet display rules may be fined up to $5,000 per day. The Attorney General can enforce compliance through civil actions in federal court.\" The Attorney General can enforce compliance through civil actions in federal court for displaying social security numbers on the internet. The term 'display to the general public on the Internet' refers to making a social security account number visible on a public Internet site, including those that require a fee for access. In cases where a State or its entities require the transmission of an individual's social security number over the Internet without proper encryption, such transmission is prohibited. The transmission of an individual's social security account number over the Internet without encryption is prohibited, and such transmission is considered as displaying the number to the general public online. The term \"person\" refers to an individual, organization, or entity, excluding a State or its agencies. The term 'person' includes individuals, organizations, or entities, but excludes State or its agencies. A 'social security account number' is the number assigned by the Commissioner of Social Security, including any derivatives. The amendment prohibits state and local governments from displaying social security account numbers on the internet. Grants are provided to help them comply with the prohibition on displaying the last 4 digits of social security account numbers. Effective date applies to violations occurring after the enactment of the Act. The Attorney General awards grants to States and political subdivisions to remove or redact the last 4 digits of social security numbers from public records displayed online, in compliance with the prohibition outlined in the Act. The Attorney General awards grants to States and political subdivisions to redact social security numbers from public records online, in compliance with the Act. States must submit an application for a grant, and $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Authorization of Appropriations: The Attorney General is authorized to receive $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to carry out the provisions of this section.
