The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objectives of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes worldwide. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, providing nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes to countries worldwide. Additionally, a report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report revealed that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received more than $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, with over $4.4 million received in 2008. Proliferation concerns persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and expertise provided through the Technical Cooperation Program. The GAO report highlighted concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program providing assistance to countries like Iran, with projects directly related to nuclear power plants, raising proliferation concerns due to the dual-use nature of nuclear technology. The GAO report in 2007 raised concerns about three TC projects in Iran being linked to the nuclear power plant at Bushehr, highlighting difficulties in identifying and resolving proliferation concerns due to lack of formal mechanisms and limited documentation. The GAO report in 2007 raised concerns about limited State documentation on how proliferation concerns of TC proposals were resolved, as well as shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures related to TC program fellowships. The report also noted that the IAEA does not exclude countries based on their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report found that the Technical Cooperation Program does not exclude countries based on their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The Deputy Director General stated that there are no good or bad countries in terms of receiving technical cooperation from the IAEA. The GAO report raised concerns about the IAEA's technical cooperation projects potentially contributing to weapons development in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. They also questioned the effectiveness of IAEA's internal safeguards in preventing this. The GAO report raised concerns about IAEA's technical cooperation projects potentially contributing to weapons development in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in countries like Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Additionally, various Acts restricted funds for the IAEA in Cuba and required the U.S. to withhold funding for certain projects. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the US to withhold funding for IAEA projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. The GAO report suggested withholding a portion of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund proportional to the amount provided for Cuba. The GAO report recommends withholding a portion of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries like Iran that support terrorism. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN regulations regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. The IAEA has repeatedly reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. The IAEA decided to provide technical cooperation to Iran only for humanitarian purposes, not for proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. In June 2009, the IAEA Director General reported that Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium and has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. The Government of Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium, running almost 5,000 of them, and has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to over 1,300 kilograms, enough for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for an atomic bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear activities. The IAEA Director General has repeatedly reported concerns about Iran's nuclear program, including possible military dimensions and Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol. The IAEA Director General reported that Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol, hindering credible assurance about undeclared nuclear activities. Iran has also not granted access to key locations related to centrifuge manufacturing and uranium enrichment, as requested by the IAEA. Iran has not cooperated with the IAEA on issues concerning possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, leading to no substantive progress. Iran has also refused to comply with resolutions. Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA regarding possible military dimensions of its nuclear program has led to no substantive progress. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with resolutions and block IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. Iran continues to block IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, denying access to enrichment sites and refusing surveillance camera placement requests. In 2006, Iran was criticized for breaches of its NPT Safeguards Agreement. In April 2008, US officials revealed Syria's secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour, built with North Korea's help, capable of producing plutonium for weapons. The reactor was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, built with North Korea's help, could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational before being destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. The IAEA Director General reported that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor in November 2008. The IAEA Director General reported to the IAEA Board of Governors in November 2008 that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour resembled an undeclared nuclear reactor. Syria has not provided requested documentation or access to other locations for inspection. The IAEA Director General stated that limited information and access from Syria have hindered the Agency's ability to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\" is a concise statement indicating a prohibition on the use of funds. No US funds to IAEA can support Technical Cooperation for countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA if the agency is spending funds on countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to funds spent on countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. If not withheld within 30 days, assessed contributions will also be withheld. If the specified amount is not withheld within 30 days and the IAEA suspends assistance to certain countries, an equal amount will be withheld from the US contribution to the IAEA. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies that these countries no longer pose a threat to US national security. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. SEC. 5. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. A report on the Act's implementation must be submitted within six months. SEC. 7. Definitions. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" is defined as a country determined by the Secretary of State for specific purposes. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to a country whose government has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for various legal purposes."
