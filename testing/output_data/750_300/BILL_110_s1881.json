In adopting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress recognized that adverse actions based on a person's impairment are often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment itself. However, the Supreme Court's ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams (2002) narrowed the interpretation of disability, contrary to congressional expectations. The Supreme Court ruled in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams (2002) that the definition of \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 should be interpreted strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification as disabled. This decision contradicted explicit congressional intent expressed in the committee reports for the Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 has been undermined by the Supreme Court's strict interpretation of the definition of \"disability,\" excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The Act aims to eliminate discrimination and establish enforceable standards.
