    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress acknowledges the development and administration of a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service since August 1987. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not negatively impacted the otters. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has administered a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters since August 1987. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not harmed the otters, but the expansion of the otter population into the designated management zone may pose national security concerns. Military training programs need flexibility to adapt to real-world events. The military departments' training programs need to evolve to adapt to real-world events, with a focus on flexibility. Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits. Public Law 99-625 gives authority under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act. Public Law 99-625 authorizes the designation of San Nicolas Island otters as a nonessential experimental population to meet military readiness requirements. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while ensuring flexibility. The purpose of this section is to establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while ensuring military readiness activities can continue as defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and surrounding waters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are established for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and the adjacent waters within specific coordinates. The San Clemente Island 3NM Safety Zone includes Naval Base Coronado, San Clemente Island, and surrounding waters up to 3 nautical miles from the shore. The Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton area includes specific coordinates within the adjacent waters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas encompass Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and adjacent waters with specific coordinates. Activities within this area may result in incidental takings under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities are exempt from the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities are exempt from the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. In the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, southern sea otters are treated as a proposed endangered or threatened species for military readiness activities, exempt from the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 allows for the protection of southern sea otters in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, exempting them from removal. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions if military activities hinder otter conservation. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, can determine if military activities are significantly hindering southern sea otter conservation or population growth. The Navy is required to monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track otter population changes and submit reports regularly. The Secretary of the Navy must report to Congress every three years on monitoring the southern sea otter population. This section does not override any other federal laws. Ecosystem management plans must align with public interests. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for the recovery of the southern sea otter in waters off the coast of California, in accordance with Public Law 99-625 and notice and comment provisions. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for waters off the coast of California. The plan aims to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, while also maintaining commercial shellfish fisheries at current harvest levels. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity within one year. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of the habitat for southern sea otters within one year, including the impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The existing relocation and management plan will continue to be implemented. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until the completion of the management plan and assessment. Definitions for incidental taking are also provided in this section. In this section, definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided. Incidental taking refers to any take of a southern sea otter that is not the purpose of a lawful activity. Optimum sustainable population is the number of animals that will result in maximum productivity while considering habitat capacity and ecosystem health. The term 'southern sea otter' refers to Enhydra lutris nereis. 'Take' in relation to activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 has a specific meaning. The term 'take' in activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has specific meanings. Military readiness activity is defined in a particular section. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 as training and operations related to combat, testing military equipment for combat use. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined as training and operations related to combat, testing military equipment for combat use. This includes all training and operations of the Armed Forces related to combat, and testing military equipment, vehicles, weapons, and sensors for proper operation and suitability for combat use.
