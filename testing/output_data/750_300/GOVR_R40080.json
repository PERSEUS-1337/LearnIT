    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, dropping from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, the number of jobs on payrolls decreased the following month. Both private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been the most affected during the economic downturn. In July 2010, total nonfarm employment rose to 130,470,000. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been hit the hardest during the economic downturn. Job losses in the service-providing sector outweigh gains, with some industries like education and health services adding workers. The financial activities industry also experienced job losses before the economy-wide downturn. The financial activities industry, including brokerage firms and banks, has been negatively affected by the housing market downturn. Job losses in this sector have outweighed gains, mirroring the trend in construction employment. Despite the belief that the recession has ended, industries like education and health services continue to add workers. The housing market downturn has negatively affected financial activities, including brokerage firms and banks. Job growth following recessions is not immediate, with sustained growth typically occurring within three to five months. Job growth following recessions is not immediate, with sustained growth typically occurring within three to five months. In most cases, steady job growth did not begin until several months after the recession ended. Congress has often directed funds to infrastructure projects to create jobs in response to a recession. In response to a recession, Congress often creates jobs by increasing federal spending on infrastructure projects, such as road and bridge building. Today, public works also includes green economic activities. Green jobs are those in industries that utilize renewable resources and produce energy-efficient goods and services. There is no consistent definition of green jobs, but they are related to activities like energy generated by wind, solar, and geothermal technologies. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, specifically looking at how job creation estimates are developed and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide and by state. The discussion focuses on job creation estimates and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide and by state, particularly in the construction industry. Researchers encounter difficulties in estimating jobs supported by green economic activities, caution is advised when using these estimates. The discussion focuses on estimating job creation in the construction industry and the caution needed when using estimates for green economic activities. Policymakers are interested in comparing stimulus options and shifting expenditures between budget categories, but without an increase in total spending, the number of jobs in the labor market would remain unchanged. The discussion focuses on estimating job creation in the construction industry and the caution needed when using estimates for green economic activities. Shifting expenditures between budget categories may not increase the number of jobs in the labor market unless there is a total spending increase. An input-output (I-O) model is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to show interrelationships between industries. An input-output (I-O) model illustrates the distribution of dollar value across industries in the production process, showing the origin of purchased products. For example, it can show how roof trusses from one industry and bricks from another are used in construction. This information is then used to determine employment requirements. The dollar value of bricks produced by the clay product and refractory manufacturing industry is used in construction to erect residential buildings. Employment requirements are derived from productivity estimates for each industry, including direct and indirect employment dependent on economic activity. The employment requirements table shows the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars spent in each industry, including direct and indirect employment. The table is a matrix showing the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars spent in each industry, including direct and indirect employment. It allows estimation of the varying impact of expenditures on different industries. The employment requirements table allows estimation of the impact of expenditures on different industries, considering direct and indirect employment. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity, affecting job creation potential over time. Estimates are often in terms of jobs created per billion dollars spent. The impact of economic activity today may differ from earlier periods due to technological advancements and productivity improvements. Estimates of job creation per billion dollars spent can vary based on changes in price levels over time. Input-output models assume unlimited resources, leading to potential differences between estimated and actual job creation. There could be differences in estimated versus actual job creation due to capital and labor constraints in a high-performing economy. Input-output tables may overstate domestic employment impact if inputs are imported and do not differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods. I-O tables may overstate domestic employment impact by not differentiating between imported and domestically produced goods. They also do not account for full-time equivalents, which can lead to inflated job creation estimates for industries with more part-time workers. The number of jobs created by economic activities includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs, with induced jobs dependent on the purchases of those in direct and indirect jobs. For example, workers from a highway construction program may spend money, creating additional jobs. The multiplier effect calculates the number of induced jobs created by additional spending from directly and indirectly employed workers. Estimates of induced jobs are uncertain and depend on how much money is spent versus saved, as well as economic conditions. The multiplier effect calculates induced jobs created by additional spending from employed workers, with estimates varying based on spending habits and economic conditions. The FHWA provides a widely known estimate of the employment impact of federal spending on roads. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides estimates on the employment impact of federal spending on roads. In 1997, $1 billion of federal-aid highway expenditures plus a $250 million state match supported 47,575 jobs. A more recent update in 2007 shows that a $1.25 billion expenditure on highway construction could support 34,779 jobs. The FHWA estimates that $1.25 billion in federal spending on highway construction could support 34,779 jobs, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from the state. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to rising input costs like asphalt and diesel fuel. The breakdown shows 9,536 construction-oriented jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA estimates that federal spending on highway construction could support 27,822 jobs per billion dollars, with 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Rising input costs like asphalt and diesel fuel have led to a decrease in the number of jobs over time. The FHWA estimates that federal spending on highway construction could support 27,822 jobs per billion dollars, with 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Induced jobs account for half of the total estimate, and specific projects can alter the number of jobs supported. The FHWA states that job estimates in I-O analysis use national average construction materials and labor mix, but local factors can change job numbers. Employment figures have been used to justify highway spending in stimulus packages, but funds spend slowly, with only 27% of a project completed. The FHWA notes that employment figures have been used to justify highway spending in economic stimulus packages. However, highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project completed in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides free access to employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of different policies on employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers free access to employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) every five years. BLS updates the tables using the latest data to reflect current production and distribution technologies, along with labor productivity data. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) updates employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) every five years. The tables reflect current production and distribution technologies, as well as labor productivity data. The BLS employment requirements table for the construction industry is based on 2006 technologies and labor productivity. The BLS employment requirements table for the construction industry, based on 2006 technologies and labor productivity, includes information for three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. The construction industry includes building construction, heavy/civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the construction sector itself. The discrepancy in job figures between BLS and FHWA data for construction expenditures is notable. The BLS employment requirements for construction expenditures are lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure for highway expenditures from the FHWA. Possible reasons for the difference include industry definition, data sources, model updating method, and time period. BLS data does not include other construction types like public school construction. Formerly, BLS surveys estimated full-time year-long employment for various construction activities. The BLS does not include public school construction in its employment estimates for various construction activities. The BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in different industries through its RIMS II system. The survey information on construction activities was last updated a few decades ago. The BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries through its RIMS II system. Estimates are provided at the subnational level for a fee, using either the 1997 benchmark I-O or the 2006 annual I-O adjusted by regional economic accounts data. Job creation estimates vary by state due to different industry mixes. The number of jobs supported by a $1 billion expenditure in the construction industry varies widely by state due to different industry mixes and earnings levels. Estimating job creation for green infrastructure activities is more challenging than traditional infrastructure projects. The number of jobs supported by construction projects varies by state. Estimating job creation for green infrastructure activities is more challenging than traditional infrastructure projects due to the lack of data on green industries in the NAICS. The NAICS categorizes industries based on their use of renewable resources and energy efficiency. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category. The conventional I-O model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs supported by industries utilizing different energy sources. The conventional I-O model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs supported by green activities like harnessing wind for electricity and producing biofuel. The construction industry lacks a unique category for retrofitting, which requires a different mix of inputs than traditional construction. Retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency requires a different mix of inputs than traditional construction, making it challenging to estimate job creation accurately using conventional I-O models. This issue is often overlooked in analyses of green job creation, but one study commissioned by the Center for American Progress addresses the problem by highlighting the limitations of current input-output tables. The Center for American Progress commissioned a study that addresses the limitations of current input-output tables in estimating job creation for green industries like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. Researchers created synthetic industries by combining parts of existing industries to account for these sectors. The researchers combined farming, forestry, wood products, and refining industries to construct the biomass \"industry\" and assigned relative weights to each. Employment projections for green jobs are often based on different assumptions and time horizons, making estimates complex. Employment projections for green jobs are often based on differing assumptions and time horizons, with some reports focusing on specific states. Results may not be generalizable due to varying state economies and industry mixes. Some analyses on green job creation focus on specific states, but their results may not be applicable to other areas due to different state economies and industry mixes. The assumptions and methodologies behind job creation estimates are often unclear, making it challenging to review the results. Many studies on green jobs were not originally intended to quickly stabilize or increase employment in industries hit hard by the recession. Many green economy studies were not originally designed to quickly create jobs in industries hard hit by the recession. Job creation estimates from organizations proposing green economy strategies are briefly described, including a report commissioned by the Center for American Progress in September 2008. The September 2008 report commissioned by the Center for American Progress proposes a two-year $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" to create almost 2 million jobs. The Economy Research Institute estimates that a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" could create or preserve almost 2 million jobs. This program would include federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for building retrofits. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a $500 billion program. Some green activities can contribute to a short-term green economic recovery program, with strategies capable of delivering within a year or up to two years for implementation. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act, proposed by the Apollo Alliance in December 2008, aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a $500 billion program. The initiative calls for federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. The job creation figures are derived from spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid, $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges, and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles. This is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) crafted by Congress. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) includes $8 billion to replace aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles, creating 37,600 direct jobs in vehicle manufacturing and 167,000 indirect jobs. Congress emphasized timely tracking of job creation in the legislation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires entities receiving funds to report estimates of direct jobs created by infrastructure projects. Recipients must submit this information quarterly, with federal agencies posting reports online 30 days after each quarter. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) mandates recipients of recovery funds to report job estimates created by infrastructure projects quarterly. Federal agencies must post these reports online 30 days after each quarter, with guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for report preparation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) are tasked with reviewing job estimates within 45 days of submission. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires recipients of recovery funds to report job estimates created by infrastructure projects quarterly. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) review job estimates within 45 days of submission. 633,342 jobs were saved or retained through September 30, 2009, based on self-reporting of ARRA recipients. OMB revised its guidance in June 2009 to clarify that a retained job refers to an existing position that would not have been continued without Recovery Act funding. OMB revised its guidance in December 2009 to define jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act, eliminating the need for subjective judgments. Recipients reported that 608,311 jobs were funded by ARRA. The updated guidance issued in December 2009 defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 682,370 jobs created or saved in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers is tasked with submitting quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) submits quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first report in September 2009 estimated that ARRA may have added around one million jobs in August 2009. Based on two estimating procedures, ARRA may have added around one million jobs to employer payrolls in August 2009. CBO provided a broader estimate of the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment and economic output. CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 led to an increase of 600,000 to 1.6 million employed individuals compared to without the law. The ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases, as estimated by CBO, led to an increase of 600,000 to 1.6 million employed individuals. The CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs aligns with CBO's range. Additionally, the CEA found that the stimulus law may have raised year-end employment by about 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs. The CEA estimated that the ARRA raised year-end employment by about 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs. CBO also estimated that the law might have increased employment by 1.0\u20132.1 million people. Additionally, the CEA's third quarterly report in April 2010 showed that ARRA might have raised employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs through March 2010. The CEA estimated that the ARRA raised employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs through March 2010. The fourth quarterly ARRA jobs report suggested that the law might have increased employment by 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010. Based on CEA's analysis, ARRA potentially increased employment by 2.5-3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010. Public investment outlays under ARRA could have added over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and over 800,000 jobs in total. Public investment outlays under ARRA potentially increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010, and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of the year. The investments were focused on various sectors including transportation infrastructure, health care delivery, technology, and building construction."
