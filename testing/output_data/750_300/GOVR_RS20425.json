    "content": "The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) builds upon the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) regarding consumer access to television signals via satellite dishes. Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to provide consumers with greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes. It continues to permit the rebroadcast of distant network signals to consumers living outside the \"Grade B contour\" of broadcast network affiliate stations. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to provide consumers with greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes. It permits the rebroadcast of local network signals back into the same local market area, in addition to distant network signals. The distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial for understanding SHVIA. The distinction between local and distant network signals is important for understanding SHVIA. Local signals are received within a network television affiliate's local area, while distant signals come from elsewhere in the country. Consumers living inside the Grade B contour may be eligible to receive distant network signals via satellite. The SHVA established eligibility for receiving distant network signals based on the Grade B contour. Consumers inside the contour were not allowed to receive such signals, while those outside (in \"white areas\") could. Court challenges arose when some satellite companies transmitted signals to consumers inside Grade B contours. In 1998, a Miami judge's decisions affected over 2 million consumers receiving or scheduled to receive distant network signals. In 1998, court challenges arose when satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to over 2 million consumers having their signals terminated. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2002, and Congress \"grandfathered\" illegal signal recipients as long as they could not receive Grade A intensity signals. New subscribers must meet the original rules to receive distant network signals. New subscribers must meet the Grade B signal intensity standard to receive distant network signals, as determined by the FCC in February 1999. SHVIA directed the FCC to review the use of the Grade B standard, which was confirmed to still be applicable. Consumers must not be receiving Grade A or Grade B signals to qualify for distant network signals. The FCC confirmed in February 1999 that the Grade B standard should still be used for determining eligibility for distant network signals. Consumers can apply for a waiver through their satellite company if they believe they are not receiving Grade A or Grade B signals. The local affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver once the request is received. The satellite company forwards waiver requests to the local network affiliate, who has 30 days to decide. If the waiver is granted or no action is taken, consumers may receive distant network signals. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost to them. Consumers can request a signal intensity test from their satellite company at no cost. The test must be conducted jointly by the satellite company and the local affiliate, with the \"loser\" bearing the cost. Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and consumers with large \"C-band\" satellite dishes. Consumers using recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, or large \"C-band\" satellite dishes may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from their local network affiliate or if they had been receiving distant signals illegally. Consumers using recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, or large \"C-band\" satellite dishes may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from their local network affiliate or if they had been receiving distant signals illegally. SHVIA permits DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service for local broadcast TV signals. \"C-band dishes can receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. SHVIA allows DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service for local broadcast TV signals within designated market areas. There is confusion regarding this service due to the must-carry provision, which requires DBS companies to provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station.\" The SHVIA allows DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service for local broadcast TV signals within designated market areas. There is confusion regarding this service due to the must-carry provision, which requires DBS companies to provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station. This does not mean that DBS companies must carry local broadcast programming nationwide, but if they choose to provide local broadcast programming in a market, they must carry all local TV stations in that market that wish to be carried. The must-carry provision for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002, requiring them to carry all local TV stations in a market that wish to be carried, with exceptions for duplicative programming and educational stations. Despite opposition from DBS companies, EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004. Both companies plan to add more markets as additional capacity becomes available. EchoStar and DirecTV opposed the must-carry requirement and attempted to overturn it in court. As of October 2004, EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets, with plans to add more markets as capacity increases. There are 210 designated market areas in the US, but smaller communities may not receive local signals via satellite. EchoStar reported that 83% of the population could receive its services when it passed the 100 DMA mark. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services in various markets. EchoStar has coverage in 152 markets, while DirecTV is in 106 markets with plans to add more. The number of DMAs served does not necessarily indicate the population percentage able to receive local-into-local. Congress passed the LOCAL Act in 2000 to ensure small and rural areas can access local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to help small and rural areas receive local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers were given a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals, ensuring programming availability at government-set prices. The 1988 and 1999 laws granted satellite carriers a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals at government-set prices. The 1999 law extended the license for distant network signals until 2004, with the 108th Congress considering further extension and price changes. Satellite companies were also given a royalty-free permanent compulsory license for retransmitting local signals. The 108th Congress is considering extending the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers to retransmit local signals. This is separate from business arrangements negotiated for retransmission consent. The SHVIA provisions permit satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and make must-carry requirements effective for satellites on January 1, 2002. Table 1 summarizes the SHVIA provisions allowing satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service, making must-carry requirements effective for satellites on January 1, 2002, and applying syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers with signal issues can have their distant network signals restored or continued. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service, with must-carry requirements effective from January 1, 2002. Subscribers with signal issues can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004, based on Grade A intensity signal criteria. Grade B signal intensity standard is retained for receiving distant network signals, with limitations on the number of signals for certain subscribers. The SHVIA provisions allow subscribers with signal issues to receive distant network signals based on Grade A intensity criteria until December 31, 2004. Subscribers unable to receive Grade B signals, recreational vehicles, and commercial trucks can receive up to two distant network signals per television network per day. A process is established for consumers to seek waivers from local affiliates for signal doubts at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004. The SHVIA provisions extend the satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004. It also creates a new compulsory license for local network signals with no sunset date, reduces copyright royalty payments for satellite companies by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals, eliminates the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers, and allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed through January 1, 2002.

Additionally, in 1999, H.R. 1554 would have created a loan guarantee program to ensure subscribers in small and rural markets benefit from local-into-local provisions. The loan guarantee program proposed in H.R. 1554 aimed to help subscribers in small and rural markets benefit from local-into-local provisions. However, the provision was removed due to objections by Senator Gramm. Instead, Congress passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act, which created a four-person board to oversee loan guarantees. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) created a board to select recipients for loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion to build systems for receiving local television signals nationwide, with a focus on serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The LOCAL Act created a board to provide loan guarantees for building systems to receive local TV signals nationwide, focusing on underserved areas and high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral and the Board issued regulations for the program in December 2003. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003. An application period ended on April 21, 2004, with one incomplete application received. The Board voted to return the application and then opened another 60-day application period, which was later rescinded on July 6. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received $280 million in funding in the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The Board rescinded a decision regarding the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program on July 6. The program, administered by the Rural Utilities Service, received $280 million in funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The GAO criticized the slow progress of the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in its annual reviews. The program faced challenges in accurately reporting administrative costs and determining fee recovery. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required the FCC to conduct tests on terrestrial systems potentially interfering with DBS satellites. The FCC selected the MITRE Corporation to conduct tests on terrestrial systems potentially interfering with DBS satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, known as the \"Northpoint provision\" for a company seeking to offer TV programming and data services. The FCC is seeking a license for terrestrial service in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, designated MVDDS. MITRE conducted interference tests in 2001, concluding that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist with mitigating techniques. DBS operators were concerned about interference, while Northpoint saw potential mitigating steps. The FCC allowed MVDDS and DBS to co-exist but dismissed Northpoint's applications. The FCC dismissed Northpoint's applications for MVDDS licenses due to potential interference with DBS operations. Northpoint objected to the decision and did not participate in the subsequent auction, where other companies raised $118.7 million. The FCC dismissed Northpoint's MVDDS license applications due to interference concerns with DBS operations, leading Northpoint to not participate in the auction. The auction raised $118.7 million. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band."
