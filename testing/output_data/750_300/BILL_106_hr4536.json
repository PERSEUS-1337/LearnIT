    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. \"Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence.\" Physical education is important for children's development, improving self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. High-quality daily physical education programs can lead to better health and fitness in children. The rise in childhood obesity is linked to low activity levels, with obesity-related diseases costing the US economy over $100 billion annually. \"Low activity levels contribute to high obesity rates among children in the US, leading to over $100 billion in obesity-related disease costs annually. Inactivity and poor diet result in 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have lower risks of heart attacks and stroke. Only 1 in 4 children get enough vigorous activity each day.\" Children's lack of physical activity is a significant factor in the high rates of obesity in the US, leading to costly obesity-related diseases. Physically fit adults have lower risks of heart attacks and stroke. Recommendations include daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Twelve years after Congress passed a resolution encouraging physical education programs for all students, little progress has been made. Every student from kindergarten to grade 12 should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health and fitness. Every student from kindergarten to grade 12 should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education programs to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for adopting healthy lifestyles. \"Program authorized under SEC. 10999D for physical education programs from kindergarten to grade 12.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. The goals include facilitating achievement of national physical education goals and providing a curriculum that supports these goals. Physical education programs should facilitate achievement of national goals for physical education, including fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive development. Physical education programs aim to enhance the physical, mental, and social development of children through activities promoting cognitive concepts, social skills, and healthy habits. Teachers of physical education are required to support lifelong healthy lifestyles. Physical education programs focus on developing cooperative skills through physical activity and teaching healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education are encouraged to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, and between agencies serving large and small student populations. Private school and home-schooled students are also included in the provisions. Private school and home-schooled students can participate in activities funded under this part, based on the number of students in the school district. A report is required for continued funding. \"Annual report required for continued funding of multiyear grants or contracts under this part to show progress towards goals and meeting State standards for physical education.\" The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing the success of programs improving physical fitness and providing recommendations for their continuation. Additionally, no more than 5% of grant funds can be used for administrative costs, and the federal share should supplement, not supplant, existing funds. Federal funds for physical education projects are limited to 90% of the total cost in the first year and 75% in subsequent years. These funds must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for physical education projects includes $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004, with funds remaining available until expended."
