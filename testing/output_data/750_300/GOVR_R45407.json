    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policies emphasize the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) Title II-A provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. It includes a competitive grant program for reforms in teacher preparation programs and reporting requirements for states to track program quality. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA through bill H.R. 4508. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) through bills such as H.R. 4508 and H.R. 6543, which would amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 and was extended for an additional fiscal year. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 and was extended for an additional fiscal year under the General Education Provisions Act. Title II-A authorities have continued to be funded under various appropriations legislation, most recently under P.L. 115-245 for FY2019. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue going forward. The report provides a description of current programs and provisions in Title II-A of the Department of Education appropriations. It identifies key issues for the debate on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, focusing on teacher preparation at institutions of higher education. The federal support for pre-service teacher preparation in the United States has traditionally focused on programs at institutions of higher education. However, the rise of alternative approaches to teacher preparation has posed challenges to existing federal policies, especially regarding program quality accountability. Most U.S. teachers have historically been trained at higher education institutions, with formal teacher training dating back to the early 20th century. Since the early 20th century, most U.S. teachers have been trained at institutions of higher education, initially at normal schools and later at schools and colleges of education within universities. This growth in teacher preparation programs was accompanied by the professionalization of teacher educators and a formalized split in the study of education. The growth of teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education was accompanied by the professionalization of teacher educators and a formalized split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. The emphasis on subject-area knowledge for teachers from English, science, and history departments contrasted with the focus on pedagogy and passing related tests in schools of education and teacher colleges. In recent years, the divide between teaching practice and subject-matter expertise has widened. The new leaders in teacher education emphasize the importance of pedagogy courses and passing related tests. Alternative routes to teacher certification focus on prior subject knowledge and classroom training. Since 1998, HEA Section 205(d) requires an annual report to Congress on teacher preparation. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report, mandated by HEA Section 205(d) since 1998, provides data on teacher preparation in the US. The most recent report for the 2012-2013 academic year shows that 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs across the 50 states. Additional data for subsequent years is available online. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs across the US, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs across the US, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, among 2,171 teacher preparation providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Among the 26,589 teacher preparation programs, 70% were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. More than 89% of the 499,800 teacher candidates were enrolled in traditional programs, while over 5% were in alternative route programs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 89% of teacher candidates were enrolled in traditional programs, while 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs and nearly 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of teacher preparation program completers, with Texas leading at 11%, followed by New York at 9%, California at 6%, Pennsylvania at 5%, and Illinois at 4%. In the 2012-2013 academic year, five states prepared 35% of teacher preparation program completers, with Texas leading at 11%, followed by New York at 9%, California at 6%, Pennsylvania at 5%, and Illinois at 4%. New York led in traditional program completions, while Texas led in alternative route completions. Texas led the nation in completers of alternative routes, accounting for 16% of individuals completing an alternative route based at an IHE and 48% of those completing an alternative route not based at an IHE. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights that traditional teacher preparation programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not require such training. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers and are online programs. The largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is about 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with percentages varying between traditional and alternative programs. The majority of teacher preparation program enrollees are white, non-Hispanic, with percentages varying between traditional and alternative programs. The most common subject areas for program completion are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score was 14 percentage points above the average cut score. The most common subject areas for teacher preparation program completion are education (16%), early childhood education (13%), English/language arts (9%), and mathematics (7%). The national average scaled score was 14 percentage points above the average cut score. Over 95% of candidates who took a state assessment passed the test. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting/accountability provisions for teacher preparation programs. Title II-A of the HEA authorizes the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, which aims to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through enhanced preparation and professional development activities. The program provides competitive grants to eligible partnerships involved in teacher preparation. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to enhance teacher preparation and professional development activities for prospective and new teachers. It supports various teacher preparation programs and provides grant funding for school leadership activities. The program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million to support partnerships. The TQP program supports school leadership activities for grantees with annual appropriations of about $42 million. Approximately 30% of awarded projects are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% are residency programs, and 23% are a combination of both. In FY2016, four teacher preparation programs received TQP grants, while 24 grants were awarded in FY2014, 12 in FY2010, and 28 in FY2009. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency. In FY2016, a TQP grant was awarded. Eligibility for the grant requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency and other specific institutions. Grantees must match 100% of the award amount with non-federal funds. TQP grantees must match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and collaborate with other federally funded programs. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation and early childhood education programs, including curriculum improvements and assessment. Grants support a wide range of reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education programs, mentoring, induction programs, and initiatives to increase compensation for qualified teachers. Grants support improvements in teacher preparation programs, such as developing high-quality clinical education, mentoring, induction programs, increasing compensation for educators, providing professional development, recruiting qualified individuals, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants are provided to develop and implement teacher residency programs that prepare teachers for success in high-need schools by offering rigorous graduate-level coursework and guided teaching apprenticeships. Teacher residency programs funded by grants aim to prepare educators for high-need schools through rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools as a cohort. Participants receive a living stipend but must commit to teaching full-time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. Teacher residency programs funded by grants aim to prepare educators for high-need schools through rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools as a cohort. Programs provide a one-year living stipend or salary, which must be repaid if recipients fail to teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. Grants are given to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, and other school leaders, promoting strong leadership skills and techniques for creating a conducive school climate for professional development and understanding teaching and assessment. Grant funds must be used to develop a yearlong clinical education program, mentoring, and leadership skills for school leaders to create a conducive environment for professional development, improve academic achievement, engage parents and community stakeholders, and understand student learning to increase academic success. Grant funds for the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program must be used to improve academic achievement, engage parents and community stakeholders, develop clinical education programs, mentoring and induction programs, and recruit qualified school leaders. Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) also includes provisions to hold teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance data. Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) includes provisions to hold teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance data. States and institutions must issue report cards to the Department of Education (ED) and the general public, using this information to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. States are required to issue report cards to the Department of Education and the general public, using state-reported information to create an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. The Higher Education Act mandates states to evaluate teacher preparation programs, report results for traditional and alternative routes, and identify low-performing programs. In 2014, states used various criteria to evaluate teacher preparation programs, including teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Other criteria included improving student achievement, raising entry standards, providing professional development, and increasing highly qualified teachers. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs based on criteria like teaching skill indicators, pass rates on credentialing assessments, improving student academic achievement, raising entry standards, providing professional development, and increasing highly qualified teachers. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs, while 30 states and jurisdictions have never identified any programs as low-performing or at-risk. A total of 45 programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk in 2014. In 2014, 45 teacher preparation programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of the total programs reported. On February 8, 2018, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved the H.R. 4508 bill, which includes amendments to the Higher Education Act. The Committee on Education and the Workforce approved H.R. 4508, a bill that would amend the Higher Education Act by repealing current Title II provisions. The ranking member introduced H.R. 6543, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that retains and amends Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program. The bill would make amendments to current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability provisions for institutions and states, and requirements for report cards from preparation entities receiving federal funds. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization, but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. President signed a resolution nullifying regulations. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added new elements to the HEA. Congress may still consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including provisions in Title II. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA), including provisions in Title II such as clearer guidance on provider versus program distinction, new post-program completion measures, and additional penalties for poor performance. Issues for consideration include the federal role in supporting teacher preparation program innovations, TQP authorized activities, and the impact of reporting and accountability provisions on program quality. Some argue for expanding the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe responsibility should remain with states and localities. Some argue for expanding the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe responsibility should remain with states and localities. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program, with some advocating for enhancements to traditional teaching routes. Debate exists over the optimal mix of activities in the TQP program. Traditional teaching proponents seek more support for supervised clinical practice and assessments, while advocates of alternative routes want fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some call for expanding federal policy on program quality and accountability. Some argue for expanding federal policy on program quality and accountability in the TQP program, citing low identification of low-performing programs and a lack of outcome-based evaluations tied to student performance. Some argue for greater accountability in the TQP program, advocating for outcome-based evaluations tied to student performance. Others believe federal accountability requirements are unnecessary and burdensome for state and local administrators."
