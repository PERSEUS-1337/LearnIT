Federal agencies must exercise authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The Federal Government must compensate property owners if an agency action limits property use, reducing its value by 20% or more. Compensation equals the value decrease caused by the action. If the value diminishes by over 50%, the owner can choose to sell that portion at fair market value. The Federal Government must compensate property owners if an agency action limits property use, reducing its value by 20% or more. If the value diminishes by over 50%, the owner can choose to sell that portion at fair market value. Property with compensated limitations cannot be used contrary to the agency action, unless the owner refunds the compensation amount adjusted for inflation to the Treasury. The Act states that if a use is considered a nuisance under State law or is already prohibited by a local zoning ordinance, no compensation will be provided for the limitation on that use. There are exceptions outlined in the Act as well. SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNo compensation under this Act for agency actions to prevent hazard to health or safety, or damage to specific property.
