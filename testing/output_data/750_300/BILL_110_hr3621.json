The Act titled the \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring architectural, engineering, and related services for surface transportation projects from private contractors to ensure taxpayers receive safe, high-quality services at the best price. This analysis helps determine if using private contractors or government employees is cost-effective and in the public interest. The Act defines \"architectural, engineering, and related services\" as various services related to construction projects, and \"private contract\" as an agreement between a government agency and a private contractor. The Act defines key terms related to construction projects, such as \"architectural, engineering, and related services\" and \"private contract\" as an agreement between a government agency and a private contractor. It also defines \"government agency\" as a entity receiving Federal funds for surface transportation projects, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Transportation. The term \"surface transportation project\" refers to projects eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, and any other projects related to surface transportation as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services, but only after conducting a cost-benefit analysis as required. The analysis must include a description of the services to be performed under the contract. A cost-benefit analysis for a private contract by a government agency must include a description of services, cost estimates for procuring the services, and cost estimates for government agency performance.

It should also determine if entering into a private contract would expedite the procurement of services. The cost-benefit analysis for a private contract by a government agency should include determining if services would be procured more quickly through a private contract or by the government agency. It should also assess if the government agency will provide equipment and materials under the private contract, along with estimating the cost of unemployment compensation or benefits for employees. The cost-benefit analysis for a private contract by a government agency should include estimating the cost of equipment, materials, unemployment compensation, and resuming service under the contract. SEC. 5.

This includes submitting the results to the Secretary for review, providing them to interested parties who register with the agency, and making them available for public inspection, including online publication. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a government agency publishing the results of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract under section 4, agency employees and interested parties can submit written comments challenging the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract.\n\nSEC. 7. USE OF QUALIFICATION-BASED SELECTION CRITERIA. SEC. 7. USE OF QUALIFICATION-BASED SELECTION CRITERIA. In procuring architectural, engineering, and related services from private sources using Federal funds for surface transportation projects, government agencies must follow procedures outlined in title 40, United States Code, or equivalent State requirements.
