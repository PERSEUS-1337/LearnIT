However, their utility is often limited by a lack of control over the generative process and understanding of the learned representation. Recent research has focused on studying the semantics of the latent space of generative models to address these issues. This paper introduces a new method to enhance the interpretability of the latent space by identifying meaningful directions for precise control. The paper proposes a new method to improve the interpretability of the latent space in generative models by identifying meaningful directions for precise control over specific properties of generated images. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for simple transformations like translation, zoom, and color variations. It is effective for both GANs and variational auto-encoders. The method aims to enhance control over generated images by identifying directions for transformations like translation, zoom, and color variations. It is effective for GANs and variational auto-encoders, improving interpretability and enabling precise image manipulation. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders are used for tasks such as image in-painting and dataset synthesis. However, the lack of control over generated images limits their effectiveness. Recent efforts have focused on allowing users to modify specific properties of generated images by manipulating latent codes or combining them. Studying the latent space of generative models provides insights into their structure. Recent studies have shown that modifying attributes of generated images can be achieved by adding a learned vector to their latent code or combining the latent codes of two images. Understanding the latent space of generative models reveals valuable insights into their structure and ability to learn unsupervised data representations. For instance, researchers have observed that latent spaces exhibit a vector space structure where certain directions encode factors of variations in the data. In auto-encoders, latent spaces show a vector space structure encoding factors of variations like object presence, position, and lighting. Factors are categorized as modal (discrete values) and continuous (range of values). The latent space in generative models encodes factors of variations like object presence, position, and characteristics, which are described by discrete and continuous values. This efficient representation of natural images is commonly used to describe scenes and objects. In generative models, the latent space encodes factors of variation in images, such as object characteristics and positions. Previous methods have limitations in controlling image generation, especially for continuous factors. A new method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control. In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in images. The method is tested on image generative models for factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, without the need for a labeled dataset or an encoder model. The method proposed allows for precise control over specific factors of variation in images without the need for labeled data or an encoder model. It focuses on factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, demonstrating effectiveness both qualitatively and quantitatively. The method proposed allows for precise control over specific factors of variation in images such as position and scale. It demonstrates the effectiveness of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing for control over the generative process and revealing insights about the latent space structure. The method enables precise control over image properties by finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. It shows that generated images can be controlled by sampling latent representations along linear directions and proposes a reconstruction loss for inverting generative models. The difficulty of inverting generative models with optimization is discussed, along with the impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models. Generative models with optimization can be challenging due to the geometry of the natural image manifold. Disentanglement impacts the ability to control these models, making it easier to modify image properties than to obtain labels. Determining the latent code of a transformed image allows for computing the difference with the original image's latent code to find the direction in the latent space corresponding to the transformation. Generative models use latent codes to find directions in the latent space corresponding to specific transformations, such as rotations or translations. The goal is to find a new latent code zT that generates an image similar to the transformed image T(I). In generative models, latent codes are used to find transformations like rotations or translations. The aim is to find a new latent code zT that generates an image similar to the transformed image T(I). This involves minimizing a reconstruction error between the original image I and its projection \u00ce. When no encoder is available, an approximate latent code \u1e91 is sought to minimize a reconstruction error L between I and \u00ce = G(\u1e91). The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial, with options like pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and pixel-wise cross-entropy commonly used in the literature. The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial in optimization problems. Commonly used options include pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and pixel-wise cross-entropy. However, pixel-wise losses can lead to blurry images, prompting the exploration of alternative reconstruction errors that are computationally expensive. The pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and pixel-wise cross-entropy are commonly used reconstruction errors but can lead to blurry images. Alternative neural networks are computationally expensive. The limited capacity of the generator results in an uncertainty over texture configurations. The limited capacity of the generator leads to uncertainty in texture configurations, resulting in blurry images when using pixel-wise errors. Expressing MSE in the Fourier domain shows that high frequencies contribute to blurriness in the reconstruction. To achieve sharper results, alternative neural networks may be needed. To reduce blurriness in image reconstruction, the weight of high frequencies is decreased in the loss function, allowing for sharper results with more details. This is achieved by adjusting the penalization of errors using the Fourier transform and a Gaussian kernel. By reducing the importance of high frequencies in the loss function, sharper and more detailed images can be generated using the convolution operator and a Gaussian kernel. The approach allows for a wider range of possibilities in generating images with realistic textures. A comparison of reconstruction errors and choices of parameters can be found in Appendix C, along with a quantitative comparison to other losses using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric. The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved without using an L2 penalty on the norm of z, which requires an additional difficult-to-choose hyper-parameter \u03b2. This problem can be generalized to every pixel-wise loss if nearby pixels follow a similar distribution. The L2 penalty requires an additional hyper-parameter \u03b2 that can be difficult to choose. Modeling the value of a pixel as a random variable x, the problem can be generalized to every pixel-wise loss if nearby pixels follow a similar distribution. Algorithm 1 involves creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space, parametrized by a parameter \u03b4t controlling the degree of transformation. The transformation in the pixel space is parametrized by \u03b4t, controlling the degree of transformation. N = 10 with \u03b4t n distributed regularly on [0, T ]. Zhu et al. (2016) proposed using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization due to slow convergence. Training a specific network for initialization is costly. In practice, the problem of slow convergence due to unlucky initialization is addressed by using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization. Training a specific network for this purpose is costly, highlighting the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space. To address slow convergence in optimization on the manifold of natural images in pixel space, the transformation is decomposed into smaller transformations. This sequential solving approach does not require extra training and can be used directly. Comparisons with a naive optimization method are provided in Appendix C. Our approach for optimization on natural images does not need extra training and can be used directly. We compare our method to a naive optimization in Appendix C. Ignoring undefined regions in images and limitations of generative models are challenges we address. To address challenges in optimization on natural images, we ignore undefined regions and limitations of generative models. When generating images, we discard outliers by removing latent codes with high reconstruction errors. To reduce outliers in generated trajectories, latent codes with high reconstruction errors are discarded. This process leads to Algorithm 1 for generating trajectories in the latent space. Additionally, a model is defined to encode factors of variations in the latent space by predicting parameters from the coordinate of the latent code along an axis. The model defines how factors of variations are encoded in the latent space by predicting parameters from the coordinate of the latent code along an axis. The distribution of the parameter can be predicted using a monotonic differentiable function. The distribution of the parameter t can be predicted using a parametrized model g \u03b8, with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u), where u = 1 and g is an increasing function. The distribution of t = g( z, u ) when z \u223c N (0, I) is given by \u03d5 : R \u2192 R +. For example, in the dSprite dataset, the horizontal position x of an object follows a uniform distribution U([\u22120.5, 0.5]), while the projection of z onto an axis u follows a normal distribution N (0, 1). The distribution of the parameter t is modeled using a parametrized function g \u03b8 with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u). The model estimates u and \u03b8 by modeling the difference \u03b4t instead of t, solving the issue of not having direct access to t for training. The distribution of the parameter t is modeled using a parametrized function g \u03b8 with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u). To estimate u and \u03b8, the model focuses on the difference \u03b4t instead of t, resolving the issue of training without direct access to t. This method allows for the estimation of image distributions generated by G and the ability to choose how to sample images based on g \u03b8. The method focuses on estimating image distributions generated by G using a parametrized function g \u03b8. It allows for control over sampling images based on the distribution of t, revealing potential bias in the training dataset. The study focuses on controlling the output distribution of generative models to uncover bias in training datasets. Experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites with binary images of shapes and ILSVRC with natural images. The study uses TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model to generate images from dSprites and ILSVRC datasets. The BigGAN model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs to generate images from specific categories. The study utilizes a BigGAN model with weights from TensorFlow-Hub to generate images. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, with the latent vector split into six parts for different scale levels in the generator. Additionally, \u03b2-VAEs were trained to explore disentanglement in generation control. The study trained \u03b2-VAEs to explore disentanglement in generation control using Conditional Batch Normalization layers. The models were trained on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness on factors of variation like position and scale. The study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of \u03b2-VAEs in exploring disentanglement in generation control. They analyzed two factors of variation, position, and scale, using different methods for simple datasets like dSprites and natural images from the BigGAN model. Saliency detection was used to estimate position, while scale was evaluated based on the proportion of salient pixels. The study evaluated the effectiveness of \u03b2-VAEs in exploring disentanglement in generation control by analyzing position and scale factors of variation. Saliency detection was used for position estimation, while scale was evaluated based on salient pixel proportion. The evaluation procedure involved generating images with latent codes and estimating the real value of the factor of variation. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative method. The study analyzed position and scale factors of variation using \u03b2-VAEs. Images were generated with latent codes to estimate the real value of the variation. An alternative evaluation method proposed by Jahanian et al. (2019) relied on an object detector, while the proposed approach was more generic and analyzed ten categories of objects from ILSVRC. Non-actual objects like \"beach\" or 'cliff\" were avoided in the analysis. The proposed approach analyzed position and scale factors of variation in images using \u03b2-VAEs on selected categories from ILSVRC. Results showed precise control over object position and scale in the latent space. To ensure independence from the category of interest, a common direction was learned from merged datasets of trajectories. The study demonstrated precise control over object position and scale in the latent space using \u03b2-VAEs on selected categories from ILSVRC. By merging datasets of trajectories, a common direction was learned, showing shared factors of variation across all categories. The study showed shared factors of variation across all categories using \u03b2-VAEs on selected categories from ILSVRC. BigGAN uses hierarchical latent code split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. The study demonstrated shared factors of variation across categories using \u03b2-VAEs on selected categories from ILSVRC. The latent code is split into six parts, with spatial factors primarily encoded in the first part. The contribution of level 5 is higher for the y position compared to the x position and scale. Quantitative results on geometric transformations for training and validation datasets are presented. The study analyzed geometric transformations on training and validation datasets, showing that the algorithm may fail for large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model when the object covers most of the image. This could be attributed to correlations between the object's vertical position and background introduced during transformations. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on algorithm performance by training \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results in Figure 5 show that controlling the object's position in the image is possible by moving in the latent space. Results from training \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with different \u03b2 values show that as \u03b2 increases, the latent space becomes more disentangled, allowing for more precise control over the position of the object in the generated images. This observation highlights the importance of disentangled representations. Our work focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control the generative process. We distinguish between GAN-like models and auto-encoders, with the latter providing an encoder for obtaining the latent representation of images. The results show that a larger \u03b2 leads to better outcomes, with a decrease in standard deviation allowing for more precise image control. This emphasizes the significance of disentangled representations in generative models. Conditional GANs and VAEs offer different approaches to controlling the generative process, with the former allowing for category selection of generated objects and the latter facing a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sample plausibility. Our method for controlling the generative process does not require labeled datasets, unlike other approaches such as VAE and InfoGan. InfoGan utilizes a code added to the GAN generator input to disentangle the latent space, while VAE faces a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sample plausibility. Our method for controlling the generative process does not require labels, unlike other approaches like VAE and InfoGan. InfoGan adds a code to the GAN generator input to disentangle the latent space, while VAE balances reconstruction accuracy and sample plausibility. Our approach can find meaningful directions in generative models without changing the learning process, even applicable to InfoGan. Bau et al. (2018) analyze neuron activations to identify object presence in generated images. Our work focuses on the latent space of generative models, offering a procedure to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder. Previous works have explored inverting the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image. Our contribution includes a method to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder. Previous studies have attempted to invert the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image, with varying success on different datasets. The reconstruction loss introduced in Section 2.1.1 improves the quality of reconstructions significantly and addresses the difficulties in inverting a generative model. In the context of improving generative models, White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness. This work introduces a \"synthetic attribute\" algorithm for generating less blurry images with a VAE by directly acting on the loss function. Recent works on ArXiv emphasize the importance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. Recent works on ArXiv highlight the significance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, with a focus on controlling their output. While similar to other methods in using transformations and linear trajectories in the latent space, our training procedure differs by first generating a dataset of interesting trajectories. Our training procedure differs from similar methods by generating a dataset of interesting trajectories before training the model. Additionally, our evaluation procedure uses a saliency model instead of a MobileNet-SSD v1 Liu et al. (2016), allowing for performance measurement on more categories. We also provide insights on controlling auto-encoders and the impact of disentangled representations on control. In contrast to previous methods, our model allows for more precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to a wider range of cases. We also introduce an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators, highlighting the differences in latent space models used. Generative models have advanced in power but still lack control over the generative process. Our model offers precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to various cases. We propose a method to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing for precise control over image properties. This approach sheds light on the interpretability of latent representations in models like BigGAN. In the context of generative models like BigGAN, a linear subspace of the latent space can represent intuitive factors of variation such as translation and scale. By considering a target image and a generated image determined by a reconstruction loss, the Fourier transform can be used to analyze the loss contribution of specific frequencies. This understanding is crucial for interpreting the representations learned by generative models. The Fourier transform can analyze the loss contribution of specific frequencies in generative models like BigGAN. By modeling the disability of the generator to capture high frequency patterns as uncertainty on the phase, the expected value of high frequency contributions to the loss can be determined. The term r^2 is constant and can be ignored in the optimization of the loss function. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was designed for experiments to generate images. The \u03b2-VAE framework introduces a convolutional VAE architecture for generating images with smoother features. The architecture includes convolutional layers with ReLU activation, dense layers, and latent representation units. The architecture introduced in the \u03b2-VAE framework includes convolutional layers with ReLU activation, dense layers, and latent representation units. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers with filters, sizes, strides, and padding, followed by dense layers with ReLU activation. The decoder part involves reshaping and transposed convolutional layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations. The study compares their loss function with previous work by Wang et al. (2004) and evaluates the impact of constraining the latent variable z. The study evaluates the impact of constraining the latent variable z in the architecture introduced in the \u03b2-VAE framework. Transposed convolution with ReLU and sigmoid activations is used for reconstruction, showing good results with certain values of \u03c3. Comparison is made with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) approaches. The study evaluates the impact of constraining the latent variable z in the architecture introduced in the \u03b2-VAE framework. Results show good reconstruction accuracy with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5. Comparison is made with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) approaches. The approach proposed in Eq. 2 demonstrates accurate reconstruction and avoids artifacts by restricting z to a ball of radius \u221a d. The study evaluated the accuracy of reconstruction using a restricted latent variable z in the \u03b2-VAE framework. Results showed good accuracy and avoidance of artifacts by limiting z to a ball of radius \u221a d. Quantitative evaluation was done on 1000 images from the ILSVRC dataset, showing promising results in Table 2. The study evaluated reconstruction accuracy using Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and found that images reconstructed with the proposed method were closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The curvature of the natural image manifold makes solving the optimization problem challenging, especially for factors like translation or rotation. The optimization problem of Equation 2 is difficult to solve, especially for factors like translation or rotation which result in curved walks in pixel-space. Images undergoing common transformations show curved trajectories in pixel space, with three types of transformations considered: translation, rotation, and scaling. The PCA of resulting trajectories is computed and plotted on the two main axes, illustrating the curved nature of the transformations. The optimization problem for factors like translation, rotation, and scaling is challenging due to curved trajectories in pixel-space. The PCA of resulting trajectories shows that large translations and rotations create orthogonal paths in pixel-space, while brightness changes linearly. This poses a problem during latent code optimization. The optimization problem arises due to orthogonal paths in pixel-space for translation and rotation, while brightness changes linearly. This leads to small gradients in the error during latent code optimization. In an ideal case where G is a bijection between Z and natural image manifold, small gradient of error with respect to latent code slows down optimization. For example, in an ideal GAN generating a small white circle on a black background, optimization can stop if gradient of loss with respect to generated image is orthogonal to the manifold. In an ideal GAN scenario, the gradient of loss with respect to the generated image being orthogonal to the manifold can halt optimization. For instance, moving a circle from left to right in an image may not affect the reconstruction error if the circles do not intersect. The two circles in Figure 8 are empty as a small translation of the object does not change the reconstruction error. Additional qualitative examples in Figure 9 show results for 10 categories of the ILSVRC dataset with geometric transformations and brightness variations using the BigGAN model. Latent codes are sampled for position, scale, and brightness by modifying u with \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22123, 3]. Categories chosen produce interesting results, with objects for position and scale, and bright or dark environments for brightness. Latent codes are sampled by modifying u with \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22123, 3] for position, scale, and brightness categories. Categories chosen produce interesting results, with objects for position and scale, and bright or dark environments for brightness. Some categories failed to control brightness due to the absence of dark images in the training data. The direction is learned on ten categories for position and scale, and only the top five categories for brightness."
