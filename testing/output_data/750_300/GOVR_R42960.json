    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Congressional focus has shifted to the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation. Recently, congressional attention has been directed towards the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation, which involves brand-name drug companies enforcing their patents against generic competitors through federal court litigation. This process can result in judgments of infringement, blocking generic competition, or judgments that the patent is invalid or not infringed. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, brand-name drug companies enforce their patents against generic competitors in federal courts. The litigation can lead to judgments of infringement, blocking generic competition, or judgments that the patent is invalid. Settlements may involve the generic firm agreeing not to challenge the patents or sell a generic version in exchange for cash payments from the brand-name company. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve agreements where generic firms agree not to challenge brand-name company patents or sell generic versions of patented drugs in exchange for cash payments. These settlements are also known as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements and have varying opinions among observers, with some attributing them to the specialized patent litigation procedures established by the Hatch-Waxman Act. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve agreements where generic firms agree not to challenge brand-name company patents or sell generic versions of patented drugs in exchange for cash payments. Some observers term these settlements as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements. Views on these settlements vary, with some attributing them to the Hatch-Waxman Act procedures, while others see them as anti-competitive and potentially violating antitrust laws. Congress has mandated notification of these settlements to antitrust authorities since 2003, but has not set substantive standards for assessing their validity under antitrust law. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. in June 17, 2013, resolved the issue of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congress mandated notification of these settlements to antitrust authorities since 2003, but did not establish substantive standards for assessing their validity under antitrust law. The decision clarified the application of general antitrust principles in evaluating these agreements. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. on June 17, 2013, addressed the legality of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The Court ruled that such settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, rather than being presumptively illegal. This decision clarified the application of antitrust law to these agreements, leaving lower courts with the task of applying the rule of reason going forward. Legislation before the 113th Congress also pertains to reverse payment settlements. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. clarified the legality of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Lower courts now apply the rule of reason to these settlements. Legislation before the 113th Congress aims to address reverse payment settlements, with bills like the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act and the FAIR Generics Act proposing reforms to reduce incentives for settlements between generic and brand-name companies. The FAIR Generics Act (S. 504) aims to reform the Hatch-Waxman Act to reduce incentives for generic firms to settle with brand-name companies. This legislation has not yet been enacted. The report discusses innovation and competition policy issues related to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, including reverse payment settlements and their status under antitrust laws. Congressional issues and possible alternatives are also summarized. The report discusses the Hatch-Waxman Act and introduces reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It analyzes the status of these settlements under antitrust laws and summarizes congressional issues and possible alternatives. Applicants must submit detailed patent applications to the USPTO for patent protection. When submitting a patent application to the USPTO, applicants must provide a detailed specification and at least one claim that defines their invention. The examiner will assess the application for novelty and nonobviousness to determine if it meets patentability criteria. The USPTO examines patent applications to determine if they meet patentability criteria, including novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior knowledge, while nonobviousness means it must not have been readily achievable based on prior art. If the application is granted, the owner(s) receive the patent. To meet the standard of nonobviousness, an invention must not have been readily achievable based on prior art. If the USPTO grants a patent, the owner(s) obtain the right to exclude others from using the invention for twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to practice their inventions or license them to others. The grant of a patent provides inventors with exclusivity for twenty years to practice their inventions or license them to others. This exclusivity allows inventors to charge higher prices and receive a return on their investment. Patent proprietors must monitor competitors to ensure they are not infringing on their patented invention. In the pharmaceutical industry, generic competition can lead to lower-cost substitutes for patented products. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate to protect their intellectual property rights. While a patent grants exclusivity, FDA approval is required before distributing a pharmaceutical product. The FDA must grant permission for a pharmaceutical product to be distributed to the public, even if it is patented. To obtain FDA marketing approval, the developer must demonstrate the product's safety and effectiveness through preclinical and clinical investigations. The FDA evaluates the data submitted in a New Drug Application (NDA) before issuing marketing approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act changed federal food and drug law regarding this process. The FDA evaluates test data in a New Drug Application (NDA) for marketing approval. Before the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own NDA. Some could use published literature for approval. Some generic drug manufacturers had to file their own NDA to sell their products, while others could rely on published scientific literature for approval. The FDA sometimes requested additional studies to address safety and efficacy concerns, leading some manufacturers to prove the drug's effectiveness again, even if their products were chemically identical to previously approved ones. Some generic manufacturers had to prove the safety and effectiveness of their chemically identical drugs again, leading to unnecessary costs and delays. Congress enacted the Hatch-Waxman Act in response to concerns about the lengthy approval process for generic drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act was enacted by Congress to address concerns about the lengthy approval process for generic drugs. It created an expedited marketing approval pathway for generic drugs called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), allowing independent generic applicants to demonstrate bioequivalence to pioneer drugs without providing safety evidence. The Hatch-Waxman Act created an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs, allowing independent generic applicants to demonstrate bioequivalence to pioneer drugs without providing safety evidence. ANDAs help generic manufacturers avoid costs and delays associated with filing a full NDA and can allow them to market their FDA-approved bioequivalent drug as soon as relevant patents expire. The Hatch-Waxman Act created an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs, allowing independent generic manufacturers to market their FDA-approved bioequivalent drug as soon as relevant patents expire. Congress also provided patent proprietors with a means for restoring a portion of the patent term lost while awaiting FDA approval, with a maximum extension period of five years. The scope of rights during the extension period is limited to the approved use of the product. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a five-year patent term extension to compensate brand-name firms for regulatory delays. The extension is limited to the approved use of the product. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes related to generic drug approval. Brand-name pharmaceutical firms may hold patents that could be infringed by generic drugs, leading to special procedures for resolving such disputes. The Hatch-Waxman Act created procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug approval. NDA applicants must submit a list of patents they believe would be infringed by generic drugs. These patents are listed in the \"Orange Book,\" and generic drug manufacturers must follow a specialized certification process for these patents. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug approval, including the use of the \"Orange Book.\" Generic drug manufacturers must go through a specialized certification process for patents listed in the Orange Book, which may involve stating their views on patent expiration, non-infringement, or agreements to delay marketing. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug approval, including the use of the \"Orange Book.\" Generic drug manufacturers must go through a specialized certification process for patents listed in the Orange Book, which may involve stating their views on patent expiration, non-infringement, or agreements to delay marketing. Certifications under the Act include paragraph I, II, III, and IV, determining approval timelines based on patent status and infringement issues. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug approval, including the use of the \"Orange Book.\" Generic drug manufacturers must go through a specialized certification process for patents listed in the Orange Book, which may involve stating their views on patent expiration, non-infringement, or agreements to delay marketing. Certifications under the Act include paragraph I, II, III, and IV, determining approval timelines based on patent status and infringement issues. An independent generic firm filing an ANDA with a paragraph III certification must wait for approval until the brand-name drug's listed patent expires, while a paragraph IV certification constitutes a form of patent infringement, requiring notification to the patent owner and potential litigation. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes challenges to pharmaceutical patents by granting a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic applicant filing a paragraph IV certification, preventing subsequent approvals for the same drug product. Following the Hatch-Waxman Act, the first ANDA applicant with a paragraph IV certification receives a 180-day exclusivity period, preventing approval for subsequent generic competitors. This can lead to higher profits for the first applicant, encouraging patent challenges. Amendments in 2003 may impact the entitlement to this exclusivity period. Following 2003 amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, a first paragraph IV ANDA applicant may lose its entitlement to the 180-day generic exclusivity period due to certain \"forfeiture events\" outlined in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA). These events include failure to promptly market the product, failure to obtain timely FDA approval, and the expiration of certified patents. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act outlines forfeiture events that can result in the loss of generic exclusivity for a first paragraph IV ANDA applicant. These events include failure to promptly market the product, failure to obtain timely FDA approval, and expiration of certified patents. The purpose is to prevent the practice of 'parking' exclusivity and to encourage prompt marketing by generic manufacturers. Generic manufacturers may face patent infringement suits if they file a paragraph IV ANDA, leading to potential injunctions preventing them from marketing the product. In such cases, generic companies often amend their ANDAs to replace paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III certifications. Alternatively, courts may rule in favor of the generic manufacturer. The expiration of the injunction on the same date as the NDA holder's patents may lead independent generic drug companies to amend their ANDAs, replacing paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III certifications. If the courts rule in favor of the independent generic firm, they may launch their product once the FDA approves their ANDA. This decision could be based on the product not infringing patents or the patents being deemed invalid or unenforceable. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, if a generic firm files a paragraph IV ANDA, they may be sued for patent infringement. The NDA holder and generic applicant would then settle, with the generic firm agreeing not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve a generic firm being sued for patent infringement under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The settlement typically includes the generic firm agreeing not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug, in exchange for compensation from the NDA holder. Opinions on the impact of these settlements on social welfare vary, with some viewing them as anticompetitive and potentially collusive agreements between firms. Some commentators have differing opinions on reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. While some believe these settlements are anticompetitive and involve firms colluding to restrict output and share profits, others see them as promoting settlement and not inherently troublesome. The agreements are said to eliminate the possibility of a judicial holding of patent invalidity, which could benefit consumers by opening the market to generic competition. Some commentators believe reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation are not inherently troublesome. Settlements can help parties avoid litigation expenses, achieve timely resolutions, and preserve judicial resources. Rational actors in litigation settlements exchange benefits. The settlement of litigation serves the goal of resolving disputes peacefully and preserving judicial resources. Judge Richard Posner explains that settlements involve an exchange of benefits and obligations, with reverse payment settlements allowing for the introduction of generic products. Reverse payment settlements in patent disputes involve agreements where the brand-name and generic firms divide the remaining patent term, allowing the generic firm to introduce a competing product before the patent expires. These agreements may benefit consumers compared to a judgment upholding the patent's validity and infringement. Reverse payment settlements in patent disputes involve agreements where brand-name and generic firms divide the remaining patent term, allowing the generic firm to market a competing product before the full patent term. Such agreements may benefit consumers compared to a judgment upholding the patent's validity and infringement. Additionally, dispute settlement procedures established by the Hatch-Waxman Act may promote the use of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. In patent litigation, the accused infringer may compensate the patent proprietor to avoid an injunction and damages. The Hatch-Waxman Act alters the balance of risks between the plaintiff-patentee and accused infringer by creating an artificial act of infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Act changes the risk balance in patent litigation by allowing generic manufacturers to challenge validity without the risk of infringement damages. This gives them the potential for exclusive generic sales, while patent holders have no upside in terms of damages to collect. The Hatch-Waxman Act alters the risk balance in patent litigation, with generic firms having limited exposure to litigation costs but immense upside in exclusive generic sales. Patent holders, on the other hand, face no upside in terms of damages but a significant downside of losing the patent. This has led to the emergence of reverse payment settlements. Congressional action on pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act mandating the Department of. Reverse payment settlements have emerged as a new phenomenon in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on this issue has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act requiring the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. These agreements trigger a notification requirement if they relate to specific topics and involve an ANDA applicant and either the NDA holder or an owner of an Orange Book-listed patent. The 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act requires notification for agreements between an ANDA applicant and an NDA holder or Orange Book-listed patent owner, if they relate to specific topics like drug manufacture, marketing, sale, or generic exclusivity. Certain agreements are exempt from this requirement. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act mandates notification for agreements between ANDA applicants and NDA holders or patent owners regarding drug-related topics. Certain agreements, such as purchase orders or employment contracts, are exempt from this requirement. The FTC reported 140 final resolutions of patent disputes in FY2012, with 40 settlements potentially involving pay-for-delay payments. The FTC reported 140 final resolutions of patent disputes in FY2012, with 40 settlements potentially involving pay-for-delay payments. The MMA imposed a filing obligation on certain patent settlements but did not set substantive standards on their validity. Various government and private actors claimed that some reverse payment settlements violated antitrust laws, leading to courts applying general principles to resolve these claims. Various government and private actors claimed that certain reverse payment settlements violated antitrust laws. Different courts applied general principles of antitrust law to resolve these claims, resulting in varying outcomes. The primary legal mechanism for addressing anti-competitive conduct, including reverse payment settlements, is the antitrust laws. The report reviews judicial opinions on reverse payment settlements, which are addressed under antitrust laws like the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. These laws prohibit anticompetitive economic conduct, with Section 1 of the Sherman Act specifically targeting restraints of trade. More detailed information on antitrust laws can be found in other sources. The Sherman Act's Section 1 declares illegal any contract, combination, or conspiracy that restrains trade, with courts interpreting this to apply only to unreasonable restraints. The determination of unreasonable restraint is made under the \"rule of reason,\" where factors like competition are considered. The \"rule of reason\" is used to determine if a practice constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade by considering various factors. This approach involves assessing the anticompetitive effects against the business justifications and potential procompetitive impact. Other restraints may be deemed unlawful per se. The rule of reason involves balancing anticompetitive consequences with business justifications. Per se illegality applies to restraints conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and illegal without detailed inquiry. The Supreme Court has established that certain agreements or practices are conclusively presumed to be illegal without elaborate inquiry, such as price fixing, group boycotts, and market division. Courts may also apply a \"quick look\" or \"truncated rule of reason\" approach in some cases. The \"quick look\" or \"truncated rule of reason\" approach in antitrust cases falls between per se illegality and rule of reason standards. It requires the defendant to show pro-competitive justifications for practices similar to those previously subject to per se treatment. Different courts have varied approaches to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The courts have differing approaches to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation, with some subjecting such agreements to strict antitrust scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit opinion in In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation held a reverse payment settlement agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals as per se invalid. The Sixth Circuit held that a reverse payment settlement agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals was per se invalid, classifying it as a horizontal agreement, a restraint of trade involving businesses at the same level of competition. Despite early precedent, subsequent Courts of Appeals reached different results on reverse payment settlements. The Court of Appeals explained that reverse payment settlements were permissible as long as they do not exceed the scope of the patent. One case involved agreements Abbott Laboratories made with generic firms, which were deemed per se illegal under the Sherman Act by the district court. The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's ruling that reverse payment settlements between Abbott Laboratories and generic firms were per se illegal under the Sherman Act. Instead, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for a determination of whether the agreements exceeded the scope of the patent, allowing antitrust scrutiny only for those portions that did. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the antitrust status of reverse payment settlements in K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, stating that such settlements are permitted as long as they do not go beyond the scope of the patent, the infringement claim is not baseless, and the patent was not obtained fraudulently. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit addressed the antitrust status of reverse payments settlements in K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, rejecting the scope of the patent test and emphasizing that the presumption of validity accorded to granted patents is merely a procedural device. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test, emphasizing that the presumption of validity for granted patents is procedural, not a substantive right. The court also highlighted the importance of congressional goals in the Hatch-Waxman Act, including invalidating improvidently granted patents through litigation. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test, emphasizing that the presumption of validity for granted patents is procedural, not a substantive right. They adopted a \"quick rule of reason\" test for reviewing settlement agreements involving weak patents, presuming reverse payments to be anticompetitive unless proven otherwise. The Third Circuit adopted a \"quick rule of reason\" test for reverse payments in settlement agreements, which could be rebutted by showing pro-competitive benefits. The Supreme Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. held that such settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, without a presumption of illegality. Solvay Pharmaceuticals is the NDA holder. The Supreme Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. held that reverse payment settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, without a presumption of illegality. Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder of the drug ANDROGEL\u00ae, settled a case with generic firms Actavis and Paddock Laboratories, who received money in exchange for delaying the marketing of their products until 2015, before Solvay's patent expired. The parties settled the case under the Hatch-Waxman Act, with generic firms receiving money to delay marketing their products until 2015, violating the FTC Act. The District Court rejected the FTC's claims, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. The District Court rejected the FTC's claims regarding generic firms delaying their low-cost products to compete with AndroGel for nine years. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision, but the Supreme Court later reversed it in a 5-3 ruling. The Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment in a 5-3 ruling regarding antitrust scrutiny on payment settlement in patent disputes. Justice Breyer stated that while a valid patent may exempt from antitrust liability, the agreement between Solvay and generic firms still required scrutiny under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Supreme Court ruled that agreements in patent disputes, even with a valid patent, still require antitrust scrutiny under the Hatch-Waxman Act. If a generic firm successfully challenges the patent, the patent holder cannot exclude the generic product, leading to potential adverse effects on competition. Justice Breyer argued that measuring anticompetitive effects alone is not sufficient to determine antitrust legality. The Supreme Court ruled that agreements in patent disputes, even with a valid patent, still require antitrust scrutiny under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Justice Breyer reasoned that antitrust legality should not be determined solely based on measuring anticompetitive effects against patent law policy. The Court summarized its patent-antitrust case law, emphasizing the need to consider procompetitive antitrust policies as well. The Supreme Court emphasized that patent-related settlements can violate antitrust laws, requiring consideration of traditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive effects, redeeming virtues, and market power. The Court also highlighted the importance of analyzing procompetitive antitrust policies in patent-antitrust case law. The Supreme Court emphasized that patent-related settlements can violate antitrust laws, considering factors like market power and legal considerations related to patents. The Court found that the Hatch-Waxman Act's structure supports subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer acknowledged the importance of settling disputes but cited concerns about large and unjustified reverse payments leading to significant anticompetitive risks. The Eleventh Circuit held that strong judicial policy favors dispute settlement, but cited concerns about large and unjustified reverse payments leading to anticompetitive risks. Factors supporting a contrary result included the risk of anticompetitive effects, inability to justify payments, market power from patents, court assessment of payment effects, and alternative ways to settle disputes without reverse payments. The Eleventh Circuit favored dispute settlement but raised concerns about large unjustified reverse payments leading to anticompetitive risks. The court can assess payment effects without litigating patent validity, and parties can settle disputes without reverse payments. Justice Breyer rejected the idea of presumptively unlawful reverse payment settlements. Justice Breyer declined to adopt the Commission's suggestion of presumptively unlawful reverse payment settlements, stating that the anticompetitive effects depend on various factors such as the size of the payment and its relation to anticipated litigation. The Court concluded that the FTC must establish antitrust liability using the traditional rule of reason analysis, rejecting the idea of presumptively unlawful reverse payment settlements. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, suggesting that a reverse payment settlement violates antitrust law only when it exceeds certain limits. The Supreme Court's Actavis decision requires the FTC to prove antitrust liability using the traditional rule of reason analysis. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, arguing that reverse payment settlements violate antitrust law only under specific circumstances. The dissenters expressed concerns about the impact on generic firms challenging patents, settlement of patent litigation, and the protection of innovators. The Actavis decision by the Supreme Court requires careful structuring of agreements in pharmaceutical patent litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act to avoid antitrust liability. Parties must be cautious in settling cases to preserve innovators' patent protection. Lower courts face the challenge of applying the rule of reason in existing agreements. Justice Breyer emphasized the need for thoroughness in these cases. The lower courts are tasked with applying the rule of reason in Hatch-Waxman cases, which may involve complex issues of patent validity and infringement. Justice Breyer believes antitrust cases may not always require a detailed examination of patents, while the Chief Justice is concerned about the intricate and costly nature of resolving these issues. Congress has various options to consider in light of this landscape. The Chief Justice is concerned about the complexity and cost of resolving patent invalidity and infringement issues in antitrust disputes. Congress has options to consider, such as awaiting further judicial developments or regulating pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The 113th Congress has two bills related to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, S. 27, aims to declare certain settlements as acts of unfair competition. The bill S. 27 aims to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding agreements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It presumes agreements with an ANDA filer receiving value and limiting research or development to be anticompetitive unless proven otherwise. The bill also includes factors for courts to consider in such cases. Additionally, the Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, is mentioned. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, proposes changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity if they win a patent challenge or are not sued for infringement by the brand company. The legislation also requires generic firms to adhere to any deferred entry date agreed upon in settlements with brand-name companies. The legislation proposed in the Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, aims to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity if they win a patent challenge or are not sued for infringement by the brand company. Additionally, generic firms must adhere to any deferred entry date agreed upon in settlements with brand-name companies. Brand-name firms are required to make a decision on enforcing their patents within 45 days of being notified of a patent challenge by a generic firm under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements are crucial for our public health system as the patient population relies on brand-name drugs. The settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation is important for our public health system as it mediates between brand-name drug companies and generic firms. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for patent litigation between these rivals, and settlements that align with antitrust principles can promote public policy goals. Settlements must be made within 45 days of a patent challenge notification by a generic firm. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for patent litigation between brand-name drug companies and generic firms. Settlements that align with antitrust principles can promote public policy goals by encouraging medical innovation and distributing its benefits to consumers."
