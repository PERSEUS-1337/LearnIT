The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose steadily until 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. The long-term impact of BAPCPA on reducing filings remains uncertain. Bankruptcy filings increased steadily until 2010, surpassing 1.5 million, similar to levels before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. There was a slight decline in filings in the first three quarters of 2011. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving credit. Household debt is primarily made up of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt such as auto and college loans. Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with a subcategory of home equity lending included in the figures. Federal Reserve estimates of the burden of debt service are also provided in Table 2. Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with home equity lending included. Federal Reserve estimates show the debt burden has gradually increased over the past decade, fluctuating between 10.80% and 13.93%. The debt burden has gradually increased over the past decade, fluctuating between 10.80% and 13.93%. Despite the decline in debt service ratio since 2007, bankruptcy rates have not significantly reduced. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have remained low. The debt burden has been gradually increasing, fluctuating between 10.80% and 13.93% over the past decade. Despite declining interest rates, bankruptcy rates have not significantly reduced since 2007. The ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising, indicating potential future increases in bankruptcy filings. The ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising, indicating potential future increases in bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Since 1980, declining interest rates have allowed households to take on more debt without a comparable increase in interest payments. Some families have thrived in the long booms of the 1980s and 1990s, while others struggle with debt. The data from Table 3 based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows the percentages of families at various income levels that devote more than 40% of their income to debt service. Lower-income families are the most likely to file for bankruptcy due to high rates of distress. The data from Table 3 shows that lower-income families are the most likely to file for bankruptcy, with no clear trend in the increase of personal bankruptcy filings. In 2007, there was little change in the percentage of families in distress compared to 1998, but there was a notable increase in upper-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The 2007 data shows little change in the percentage of families in distress compared to 1998, but there was a notable increase in upper-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The question remains why many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed credit card issuers for financial distress leading to bankruptcy filings. The lack of a consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcies remains controversial, especially with the U.S. economy entering a recession in December 2007. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic, leading to a decline in household debt levels. Debt balances fell for 11 quarters until a slight rise in the second quarter of 2011, followed by another decline in the third quarter. Home equity and credit card debt saw the most significant percentage decline, while mortgage debt accounted for the largest dollar amount. Debt levels fell in the third quarter of 2011, with home equity and credit card debt leading the decline on a percentage basis. Mortgage debt accounted for the majority of the drop in dollar terms, attributed to factors such as debt repayment, reduced borrowing, increased uncollectible debt write-offs, and tightened credit standards by lenders. Mortgage balances decreased due to modifications, negotiations reducing outstanding principal, and foreclosures.
