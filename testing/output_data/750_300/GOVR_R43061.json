The report discusses factors influencing the U.S. S&E workforce, such as technology advancements and changes in market opportunities. It does not attribute changes to specific factors. Various factors may affect the comparability of OES data over time, including changes in classification systems and data collection methods. The OES data is less useful for comparing multiple points in time due to challenges like changes in classification systems, data collection methods, survey reference period, and wage estimation methodology. To ensure comparability, the CRS examined trends from 2012-2016, aiming to reduce inconsistencies and provide a current perspective on S&E occupations. The survey used the same occupational categories throughout. The Bureau of Labor Statistics aims to enhance data comparability across the 2012-2016 period by using consistent occupational categories. Estimates for employment projections consider various factors like population size, labor force participation rates, and demographic trends. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses various factors in developing employment projections, including population size, labor force participation rates, demographic trends, economic growth, technological innovation, and changes in business practices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics changed its methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections due to identified issues with the previous method. The Bureau of Labor Statistics no longer uses the occupational replacement methodology in its projections due to identified issues. Other factors affecting occupational projections include changes in immigration laws, technology advances, and shifts in consumer tastes. The BLS regularly evaluates the accuracy of its projections and publishes these evaluations in its Monthly Labor Review.

This analysis is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational employment projections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with a higher growth rate compared to all occupations. The science and engineering workforce is expected to grow by 853,600 jobs (11.7%) between 2016 and 2026, with a higher growth rate than all occupations. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are projected to exit the labor force, resulting in nearly 2.3 million job openings in S&E occupations. The science and engineering workforce is projected to grow by 853,600 jobs between 2016 and 2026, with 1.439 million workers exiting the labor force. This will result in nearly 2.3 million job openings in S&E occupations. Additionally, there will be 3.7 million openings created by occupational transfers during this period. The BLS projections do not provide data for a quantitative analysis of how many new workers will be needed for job openings in S&E and non-S&E occupations. Workers may transfer between S&E occupations or from non-S&E occupations into S&E occupations. According to BLS projections, workers can transfer between S&E occupations or from non-S&E occupations into S&E occupations. The projections methodology allows for multiple occupational transfers during a 10-year period. Employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups are provided in Table 10, showing actual and projected employment numbers, total change, percentage increase, and compound annual growth. Table 10 provides employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups, including actual and projected employment numbers, total change, percentage increase, compound annual growth rate, annual average increase in jobs, occupational separations, and total job openings. Computer occupations are expected to have the largest increase in employed individuals. Computer occupations are projected to see the largest increase in the number employed, labor force exits, and occupational transfers among science and engineering occupational groups. They are expected to account for 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations between 2016 and 2026, with their share rising to 58.6% in 2026. Computer occupations are projected to account for 58.0% of all S&E jobs in 2016 and are expected to contribute to 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations by 2026. Mathematical occupations will have the fastest employment growth at a rate of 2.5% CAGR, increasing their share of total S&E employment from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. S&E Managers are projected to contribute 7.0% of total S&E job growth from 2016 to 2026, down from their 8.3% share in 2016.

Engineers are expected to contribute 16.2% of job growth, below their 23.0% share in 2016. Life Scientists are projected to account for 3.8% of total S&E job growth during the 2016-2026 period, reducing their projected share of 2026 S&E employment to 4.4%. Physical Scientists are projected to account for 3.2% of total S&E job growth during the same period, reducing their projected share of 2026 S&E employment to 3.7%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of new jobs created in S&E occupations will be less than the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce. Labor force exits greatly exceed the number of projected new jobs in nearly all S&E occupational groups. For example, 385,000 labor force exits are projected. The number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than the number of labor force exits. For most occupational groups, labor force exits exceed projected new job openings. In engineering occupations, there are 385,000 labor force exits and 138,900 new job openings. However, in mathematical occupations, job growth is expected to exceed labor force exits. During the 2016-2026 period, job growth in S&E occupations is projected to surpass labor force exits. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows variations in job growth and labor force for S&E occupations. Top 10 S&E occupations in terms of job growth are detailed in tables.

It includes engineering occupations, architectural and engineering managers, life sciences, and computer occupations. Table 15 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings, including computer occupations, computer and information systems managers, and engineering occupations like civil and mechanical. The 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings include computer occupations, engineering occupations, and mathematical occupations, accounting for 60.8% of all projected job openings in S&E. In contrast, the 10 occupations with the fewest projected job openings represent less than 1% of all S&E job openings during the projection period, spanning across life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Table 16 displays the 10 S&E occupations with the lowest projected job openings, accounting for less than 1% of all S&E job openings. These occupations span across life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics, and are considered vital for U.S. technological leadership and economic strength. The adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce has been a long-standing concern for Congress. The U.S. science and engineering workforce is a concern for Congress, with ongoing efforts to support education and development in STEM fields. Policymakers are looking to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers working in the country through visa changes. Some policymakers aim to boost the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa changes, amid debates on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce. There are varying perspectives on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce in the United States, with debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, and if the federal government should intervene or let market forces work. The federal government may need to intervene to address a potential shortage of scientists and engineers, which could impact U.S. leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry, as well as economic growth, job creation, standard of living, and national security. The need for more scientists and engineers in the United States is emphasized, regardless of whether there is a shortage. Federal policies and investments have historically contributed to the development of the scientific and engineering workforce, which is crucial for maintaining leadership in various sectors and ensuring economic growth, job creation, and national security. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers will boost innovation, economic performance, and job creation. STEM knowledge is increasingly important in many occupations, and S&E degree holders gain valuable skills for success in various fields. Students who earn S&E degrees gain valuable thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling success in S&E occupations, related careers, and other fields where STEM knowledge is applicable. Government interventions to address shortages in the S&E labor market may lead to inefficiencies, such as an oversupply of S&E graduates compared to available jobs. Efforts to increase the number of scientists and engineers through incentives or immigration quotas may lead to inefficiencies in the S&E labor market. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable, resulting in potential mismatches between education and market needs. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to various factors such as technological changes, market shifts, and government policies, leading to potential mismatches between education and market needs. Shortages may occur in certain industries or fields, impacting the availability of S&E professionals. Shortages in S&E occupations may exist due to factors like changes in prices, retirement behavior, foreign labor availability, demographics, and government policies. Shortages can be seen in new and emerging S&E fields, cyclical industries, and where foreign scientists are restricted. The labor market will address these needs if allowed to operate freely. Shortages in S&E occupations may lead to adverse consequences and require government interventions to increase supply. Without government interventions, the U.S. may risk losing technological leadership in new fields. Shortages in S&E occupations may lead to adverse consequences and require government interventions to increase supply. The potential adverse consequences of shortages require federal efforts to prevent loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry assertions of shortages are driven by a desire to reduce costs and increase supply through education, training, and immigration. Industry assertions of S&E shortages aim to lower labor costs by increasing the supply of young, lower-cost graduates through education, training, and immigration. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people. Employers struggle to meet their S&E workforce needs due to a mismatch between the specific skills needed and those held by workers. Expanding immigration can help address this issue. Expanding immigration can help address the skills mismatch in the S&E workforce by increasing the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States, benefiting the U.S. economy and reducing the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals with S&E degrees. Expanding immigration to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States may depress wages, increase unemployment, and reduce career opportunities for U.S. scientists and engineers, discouraging American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers. Expanding immigration to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States may depress wages, increase unemployment, and reduce career opportunities for U.S. scientists and engineers. This could discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers, leading to lower economic growth and reduced economic competitiveness. Federal efforts to improve STEM education are necessary to address the lag in STEM knowledge among U.S. students compared to their foreign counterparts. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the United States as U.S. students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to a shortage of skilled scientists and engineers, impacting economic growth and competitiveness. International assessments do not accurately reflect the STEM knowledge of U.S. students, highlighting the importance of federal policies and programs to strengthen K-12 STEM education. Standardized tests comparing STEM knowledge of U.S. K-12 students to other nations do not accurately reflect their preparation for S&E degrees or future capabilities as scientists and engineers. This leads to differing opinions on federal government's role in developing the S&E workforce, including policies to increase students pursuing S&E degrees and diversity in the field. The federal government plays a role in developing the S&E workforce by considering policies to increase the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, diversity in the field, and improving STEM education. Congress may consider these perspectives when enhancing U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. To enhance U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry, the federal government may consider various perspectives and opinions, including S&E occupational descriptions, entry-level education requirements, and the composition of S&E occupations by education level. Data collected from the American Community Survey is used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for biannual employment projections and educational composition of occupations. A crosswalk of Standard Occupational Classification codes to ACS codes is provided for reference. The American Community Survey (ACS) uses a compressed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, with a crosswalk provided at the end of the appendix. The occupational composition of ACS classifications corresponding to SOC codes for S&E occupations is shown in chart form, with educational levels below associate's degrees aggregated into a category called \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes levels such as \"less than high school diploma,\" \"high school diploma or equivalent,\" and \"some college, no degree.\""
