The text discusses the relationship between model generalization and local properties of the optima, focusing on the Hessian and its higher-order \"smoothness\" terms. A metric is proposed to score the generalization capability of the model, along with an algorithm to optimize the perturbed model. Deep models have proven successful in applications like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, despite having millions of parameters. The text discusses the relationship between model generalization and the complexity of the hypothesis space. It suggests that even if the hypothesis space is complex, the final solution learned from a training set may still be simple, impacting the generalization capability of the model. The relationship between model generalization and the complexity of the hypothesis space is explored. The generalization ability of a model is linked to the spectrum of the Hessian matrix evaluated at the solution, with large eigenvalues often leading to poor generalization. Various metrics to measure the \"sharpness\" of the solution are introduced, showing a connection between sharpness and generalization. The text discusses different metrics to measure the \"sharpness\" of a solution and the connection between sharpness and generalization. It also highlights issues with Hessian-based sharpness measures and the impact of re-parameterization on parameter geometry in RELU-MLP models. Additionally, it mentions the use of Taylor expansion in Bayesian analysis to evaluate the loss function's Hessian for model approximation. Recent work in Bayesian analysis has utilized Taylor expansion to approximate the posterior, focusing on the Hessian of the loss function as a measure of model simplicity. This approach has been used to penalize sharp minima and determine optimal batch sizes. Additionally, the PAC-Bayes bound has been connected to Bayesian marginal likelihood, offering a new perspective on Occam's razor. Various studies have applied the PAC-Bayes bound to analyze the generalization behavior of deep models. The PAC-Bayes bound has been used to analyze the generalization behavior of deep models, including the use of alternative perspectives on Occam's razor. It holds uniformly for all \"posteriors\", allowing for the incorporation of local properties of the solution into generalization. The sharp minimum may approximate the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Incorporating local properties of the solution into generalization analysis, BID28 suggests using the difference between perturbed loss and empirical loss as a sharpness metric. BID3 aims to optimize the PAC-Bayes bound for better model generalization. Fundamental questions remain on how model generalization is related to the local \"smoothness\" of a solution. In this paper, the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution is explored from a PAC-Bayes perspective. The generalization error is shown to be linked to the Hessian of the loss function, the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, parameter scales, and the number of training samples. This analysis introduces a new metric for generalization and allows for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to improve generalization. The analysis explores the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution, linking it to the Hessian of the loss function, Lipschitz constant, parameter scales, and training sample size. A new metric for generalization is introduced, leading to the selection of an optimal perturbation level for improved generalization. This insight inspires a perturbation-based algorithm utilizing Hessian estimation to enhance model generalization in supervised learning scenarios. The PAC-Bayes paradigm focuses on minimizing expected loss by considering probability measures over a function class. It suggests a gap between expected loss and empirical loss, emphasizing the importance of model generalization. The PAC-Bayes paradigm emphasizes minimizing expected loss by considering probability measures over a function class. The gap between expected loss and empirical loss is bounded by a term related to KL divergence, suggesting model generalization. The PAC-Bayes paradigm focuses on minimizing expected loss by using probability measures over a function class. The perturbation bound connects generalization with local properties around the solution w through random perturbations u. The perturbation bound FORMULA4 connects generalization with local properties around the solution w through perturbations u. It is important to find an optimal perturbation level for u to minimize the bound. Researchers have found that the generalization ability of models is related to second-order information around local optima. In this section, the authors introduce the local smoothness assumption and their main theorem, focusing on connecting the Hessian matrix with model generalization. The assumptions only hold in a small local neighborhood around a reference point, defining the neighborhood set as a \"radius\". In this paper, the authors introduce the concept of local smoothness assumptions and their main theorem, which focuses on the connection between the Hessian matrix and model generalization. The assumptions are limited to a small local neighborhood around a reference point, defining the neighborhood set as a \"radius\". The paper discusses the control of the deviation of the optimal solution by assuming the empirical loss function is Hessian Lipschitz. The paper introduces local smoothness assumptions and their connection to model generalization. It discusses controlling the deviation of the optimal solution by assuming the empirical loss function is Hessian Lipschitz. The Hessian Lipschitz condition is used to model the smoothness of second-order gradients in numeric optimization. The draft assumes convexity and \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz for FORMULA2. Theorem 2 guarantees control over expected loss with carefully chosen perturbation levels. The bound relates to diagonal Hessian elements, Lipschitz constant \u03c1, and neighborhood scales. Theorem 2 provides control over expected loss by choosing perturbation levels carefully, related to Hessian diagonal elements, Lipschitz constant \u03c1, neighborhood scales, number of parameters, and samples. Perturbation level is inversely related to \u2207 2 i,iL, suggesting perturbing more along \"flat\" coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is discussed in Appendix B. Next section explores intuitions behind the arguments. The perturbation of the function around a fixed point can be bounded by terms up to the third-order, with zero expectation simplifying the linear and second-order terms. The linear and second-order terms in the perturbation of the function around a fixed point with zero expectation can be simplified, leading to a uniform distribution of model parameters. The perturbed parameters are assumed to be bounded, and the third-order term is also bounded. The distribution of model parameters varies for different parameters and is assumed to be bounded. The third-order term is bounded as well. The proof procedure remains similar even if the same bound is assumed for all parameters. The lemma states that the loss function is within the range [0, 1] and model weights are optimized to minimize the right-hand side. Lemma 3 states that the loss function is bounded between 0 and 1, and model weights are constrained. The experiment treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter, while Theorem 2 involves optimizing for the best \u03b7. The loss function is bounded between 0 and 1, with model weights constrained. The experiment treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter, while Theorem 2 involves optimizing for the best \u03b7. The spectrum of \u2207 2L is not enough to determine generalization power for a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation. Re-parameterization of the model can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting model prediction and generalization. When cross entropy is used as the loss function, re-parameterizing a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation can scale the Hessian spectrum without impacting model prediction and generalization. The bound does not assume the loss to be cross entropy or the model to be RELU-MLP, leading to changes in the bound during re-parameterization. The optimal perturbation levels in the bound scale inversely with parameter scaling. The bound changes approximately with a logarithmic factor during re-parameterization, with optimal perturbation levels scaling inversely with parameter scaling. For RELU-MLP, the change in the bound is small when using the re-parameterization trick. The text discusses heuristic-based approximations and empirical observations inspired by the bound, introducing a PAC-Bayes based Generalization metric called pacGen. The metric assumes local convexity and utilizes optimal perturbation levels to approximate \u03c4 i. At Lemma 3, the relevant term is i log \u03c4i \u03c3 * i. The PAC-Bayes based Generalization metric, pacGen, is introduced, assuming local convexity. Real-world data requires estimating diagonal elements of the Hessian \u2207 2L and the Lipschitz constant \u03c1. To estimate \u03c1, the Hessian of a randomly perturbed model is used. To estimate the diagonal elements of the Hessian and the Lipschitz constant \u03c1, we follow Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and approximate \u2207. The neighborhood radius \u03ba is set to \u03b3 = 0.1 and = 0.1 for all experiments. Using the same model without dropout, we vary the batch size for training with a fixed learning rate of 0.1. The gap between test and training loss, and metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) are plotted in Figure 2, showing similar observations as in previous studies. In a PyTorch example, the learning rate is fixed at 0.1 while varying the batch size for training. The gap between test and training loss increases as batch size grows, as shown in Figure 2. A proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) follows the same trend. LR annealing heuristics are not used to enable large batch training. Another experiment fixes the batch size at 256 and varies the learning rate, showing the generalization gap and \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) as a function of epochs in Figure 4. The experiment fixed the batch size at 256 and varied the learning rate, showing the generalization gap and \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) as a function of epochs in Figure 4. The learning rate decrease led to an increase in the gap between test and training loss, with similar trends observed in the proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ). Noise addition to the model for better generalization has been successful empirically and theoretically. Adding noise to the model for better generalization has proven successful both empirically and theoretically. Instead of only minimizing the empirical loss, it is suggested to optimize the perturbed empirical loss for a better model generalization power. A systematic way to perturb the model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound is introduced. The same exponential smoothing technique as in Adam is used to estimate the perturbed weights. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, using an exponential smoothing technique to estimate the Hessian. The perturbation is applied to parameters with small gradients to improve model generalization. In Algorithm 1, parameters with small gradients are perturbed based on the PAC-Bayes bound. A per-parameter \u03c1 i captures the variation of the diagonal element of Hessian, with perturbation level decreasing logarithmically as epochs increase. The perturbed algorithm is compared against the original optimization method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 as the prediction model. The perturbed algorithm decreases perturbation level logarithmically with epochs. It is compared against the original optimization method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 as the prediction model. Various parameters and settings are specified for each dataset. The perturbed algorithm uses specific parameters for optimization on different datasets. For CIFAR, Adam optimizer with learning rate 10^-4 is used, while for Tiny ImageNet, SGD optimizer with learning rate 10^-2 is used. The perturbed algorithm uses specific parameters for optimization on different datasets. For CIFAR, Adam optimizer with learning rate 10^-4 is used, while for Tiny ImageNet, SGD optimizer with learning rate 10^-2 is used. The perturbation effect is similar to regularization, with training set accuracy decreasing but validation set accuracy increasing. PerturbedOPT performs better than dropout, possibly due to this effect. The perturbation effect on Tiny ImageNet is similar to regularization, leading to a decrease in training set accuracy but an increase in validation set accuracy. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout by applying different levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures. The generalization power of a model is linked to the Hessian and smoothness of the solution in the PAC-Bayes framework. The generalization power of a model is related to the Hessian, smoothness of the solution, parameter scales, and training sample size. Perturbation levels scale inversely with the square root of the Hessian, canceling out effects in re-parameterization. This is the first work to rigorously integrate Hessian in model generalization bounds. The curr_chunk discusses the integration of Hessian in model generalization bounds, proposing a new metric and perturbation algorithm based on the Hessian. Empirical results show the algorithm's effectiveness in improving performance on unseen data. The curr_chunk details a toy example using a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3 Gaussians, with binarized labels. A 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss is used, with shared weights and no bias terms in linear layers. Two entries in the shared 2-by-2 linear coefficient matrix are treated as constants. The model used in the toy example is a 5-layer MLP with shared weights and no bias terms in linear layers. The model has only two free parameters, w1 and w2, and is trained using 100 samples. The loss function is plotted with respect to the model variables, showing many local optima including a sharp one and a flat one. In the toy example, the loss function is plotted with respect to model variables w1 and w2, showing multiple local optima. The colors on the loss surface represent the generalization metric scores, with a smaller score indicating better generalization power. The global optimum has a high metric score, suggesting possible poor generalization capability compared to a local optimum. The figure displays metric scores around the global and local optima, indicating potential poor generalization capability at the global optimum. The color on the bottom plane represents an approximated generalization bound considering both loss and generalization metric. The local optimum, despite slightly higher loss, has a similar overall bound to the global optimum. The local optimum, indicated by the red bar, has a similar overall bound to the \"sharp\" global optimum. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Truncating the Gaussian distribution is necessary as the inequality requires bounded perturbation. After truncating the Gaussian distribution, the procedure is similar to the proof in BID29 and BID24. The event DISPLAYFORM1 is analyzed using a union bound with P(E) \u2265 1/2. The coefficients are bounded and the prior \u03c0 is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). The bound is approximated with \u03b7 = 39 using inequality (8). The error function erf(x) = is defined with bounded coefficients i w 2 i \u2264 \u03c4. The prior \u03c0 is N(0, \u03c4 I) and the bound is approximated with \u03b7 = 39. When L(w) is convex around w*, solve for the best \u03c3 i to get Lemma 4 for loss function l(f, x, y) \u2208 [0, 1] with bounded model weights i w 2 i \u2264 \u03c4. Lemma 4 states that for a loss function with bounded model weights, with probability at least 1 - \u03b4 over n samples, a certain inequality holds. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter instead of optimizing it over a grid. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter instead of optimizing it over a grid to get a tighter bound. The proof involves rewriting inequalities and solving for \u03c3 to minimize certain terms, ultimately completing the proof. The proof involves combining inequalities and equations to optimize \u03b7 over a grid. The quadratic term in the inequality is bounded by extrema of the Rayleigh quotient, consistent with empirical observations. The generalization ability of the model is related to the eigenvalues of \u22072L(w). Even if perturbations u i and u j are correlated, the inequality still holds. Another lemma states that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of n samples, the loss function l(f, x, y) is bounded by extrema of the Rayleigh quotient. Lemma 5 discusses the local optimal point w* and perturbations u, proving the local \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition. The proof shows that even if E[u] = 0, the quadratic term is bounded by the extrema of the Rayleigh quotient. The proof of Lemma 5 shows that the quadratic term is bounded by the extrema of the Rayleigh quotient, even if E[u] = 0. Dropout and the proposed perturbation algorithm are compared in this section. Dropout is a multiplicative perturbation using Bernoulli distribution widely used in deep models. In this section, dropout and the proposed perturbation algorithm are compared using wide resnet architectures. Results are reported for different dropout rates on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The pertOPT algorithm has all dropout layers turned off, with a wide resnet model of depth 58 and widenfactor of 3. Adam is used for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. For Tiny ImageNet, the wide resnet model BID36 has a depth of 58 and a widenfactor of 3. Adam is used with a learning rate of 10^-4 and a batch size of 128 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Perturbation parameters include \u03b7 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 10, and =1e-5. For Tiny ImageNet, SGD is used with a learning rate of 10^-2 and a batch size of 200, with perturbed SGD parameters set as \u03b7 = 100, \u03b3 = 1, and =1e-5. Validation set is used as the test set for Tiny ImageNet. Accuracy versus epochs is shown in figures for training and validation in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100.

Validation set is used as the test set for Tiny ImageNet. Accuracy versus epochs is shown in figures for training and validation in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. With added dropout, validation/test accuracy improved compared to the original method. Dropout rate of 0.3 works best for CIFAR-10, while 0.1 works better for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet due to the need for more regularization in CIFAR-10. In experiments, dropout rate 0.3 is optimal for CIFAR-10, while 0.1 works better for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout methods, possibly due to tailored perturbation levels for parameters based on local smoothness structures."
