    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Congress is exploring ways to enhance security in unstable regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. Military forces play a crucial role in providing initial security and maintaining law and order in peacekeeping operations. International civilian police (CivPol) have become increasingly recognized as more suitable than military forces for law and order tasks in post-conflict environments. Their use has significantly increased, with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee supporting their effectiveness in a March 2004 report. International civilian police (CivPol) are now seen as more suitable than military forces for law and order tasks in post-conflict situations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee supports their effectiveness, recognizing the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations in promoting stability. Policymakers are addressing issues with their use, including the need for continued improvements and potential expansion of U.S. involvement. Policymakers are addressing issues with the use of international civilian police (CivPol) in post-conflict situations, including the need for improvements and potential expansion of U.S. involvement. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for complex missions and ensuring appropriate training for handling law enforcement situations. Advocates propose reforms to improve international civilian police (CivPol) systems and training for handling law enforcement situations, including recommendations from key documents like the Clinton Administration's PDD-71. The Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's \"Brahimi Panel\" report recommended mechanisms to improve CivPol systems and peacekeeping operations. PDD-71 focused on law enforcement aspects, while the Brahimi Panel report addressed broader issues with specific recommendations for the UN. The United Nations has begun implementing some recommendations from the Brahimi Panel report to address issues with the U.N. civilian police system, including recruitment, training, and deployment of international civilian police personnel. Proposed reforms are still under discussion, with advocates suggesting the creation of a reserve CivPol force. The United Nations has started implementing some Brahimi Panel recommendations and other proposed reforms, including the creation of a reserve CivPol force and diversification of international police forces. Other suggestions include establishing units with military skills for crowd control and enhancing civilian response mechanisms. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of police units with military skills for crowd control and the development of civilian response mechanisms to improve law enforcement systems. Policymakers are interested in whether these recommendations could reduce the need for U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report will provide a brief overview of the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, highlighting problems encountered. It will also discuss current mechanisms for providing CivPols to international operations and recommendations for improvement. The report discusses the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, current mechanisms for providing CivPols, recommendations for improvement, and options for the U.S. Congress for continued enhancements. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions in peace operations. The number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations has increased significantly over the years, with 4,655 international civilian police currently deployed, including 476 Americans. The number of international civilian police (UNCIVPOLs) has increased significantly over the years, with 4,655 currently deployed, including 476 Americans. Some analysts suggest deploying sizable contingents to Afghanistan for law enforcement tasks. The deployment of international civilian police forces to post-conflict areas like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti is recommended by analysts. As of February 29, 2004, five UNCIVPOL were deployed to Afghanistan, with U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad in post-conflict situations like Afghanistan is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which prohibits aid for police, prisons, or internal intelligence, except in specific exempted cases. Assistance in post-conflict situations is provided on a case-by-case basis due to the lack of specific statutory authority. Assistance in post-conflict situations is provided on a case-by-case basis as there is no specific statutory authority to regulate and fund such aid. International civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes since the late 19th century, involving monitoring, supervising, training, and restructuring local forces. Since the late 19th century, international police forces have been involved in monitoring, supervising, training, and restructuring local forces. They provide support for human rights, monitoring, advising, reporting, and training, and sometimes have executive authority. Policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved over the past decade. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations over the past decade has gone through five phases of increasing scope and complexity, aimed at establishing security. International forces have been armed and granted arrest powers in some cases, but not always. Operations do not necessarily have to be modeled after the latest ones. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, involving the expansion of U.N. activities, addition of training components, and development of mandates for reform and restructuring. Operations do not always need to follow the latest ones. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including adhoc efforts in Cambodia, intensified efforts in El Salvador, and the development of mandates for substantial reform in Somalia and Haiti. This also involved the addition of constabulary units for hostile situations in Bosnia, and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority in East Timor and Kosovo. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of constabulary units for hostile situations in Bosnia, and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority in East Timor and Kosovo. This evolution reflected the international community's growing awareness of the broad range of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including constabulary units in Bosnia and executive authority for international police in East Timor and Kosovo. This evolution reflects the international community's awareness of security needs and assistance required by indigenous police forces in peace operations. Policymakers and analysts recognize the importance of ensuring public security jointly with indigenous personnel. Policymakers and analysts are focused on improving mechanisms for implementing peacekeeping mandates by addressing gaps in public security. This includes the need for clear mandates and standards for effective implementation, particularly in collaboration with indigenous personnel. Analysts have identified two problem areas in implementing peacekeeping mandates: a system gap related to recruitment and training mechanisms, particularly acute for the United Nations due to diverse policing practices among volunteers. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen from diverse countries with varying police standards. Some recruits lack basic skills and language capabilities, while others have been involved in corruption. Despite adopting procedures to filter out unsuitable candidates, the organization still struggles to assemble effective policing teams. The United Nations has adopted procedures to address challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen for complex missions. However, problems persist in finding personnel with necessary skills and in providing additional training for generic policing skills and professionalism. Another issue is the presence of security gaps in policing missions. Training is required to improve and instill a common set of \"generic\" policing skills necessary for all policing missions and enhance the ability to work together. There are three security gaps in the ability of the international community to establish law and order in peacekeeping and post-conflict situations, which can be troublesome in situations where not all parties are dedicated to peace or criminal networks are present. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems can contribute to these gaps. The deployment gap in security missions arises from the failure to quickly deploy police forces in sufficient numbers, as seen in past international interventions like in Panama in 1989 and Cambodia in the 1990s. The deployment gap in security missions is evident in past interventions like Panama in 1989 and Cambodia in the 1990s, where delays in deploying police forces hindered mission effectiveness. Deployment times have improved but challenges persist in meeting authorized mission sizes. The United Nations has faced challenges in deploying enough specialized personnel for security missions, leading to delays and gaps in mission effectiveness. The enforcement gap refers to the inability of deployed police forces to provide necessary security for normal policing operations, often lacking the required skills. Deployment times have improved but issues persist in meeting authorized mission sizes. The enforcement gap is the inability of police forces to provide necessary security for normal policing operations due to lack of skills, especially in handling hostile situations and dealing with organized crime. Military forces may not always be available to assist in these situations, leading to challenges in peacekeeping operations. In post-conflict situations, the lack of military forces to assist police in handling hostile situations can compromise peacekeeping operations. The institution gap arises when indigenous law enforcement systems lack sufficient personnel and institutions for effective prosecution and punishment, leading to challenges in maintaining sustainable security. In post-conflict situations, the international community has provided police assistance to address the lack of personnel and resources in judiciaries and penal systems, hindering effective prosecution and punishment for sustainable security. The United Nations and European countries have been key actors in these efforts. The international community has provided police assistance through various mechanisms since the end of the Cold War. The United Nations, European countries, regional organizations, and the United States have all played important roles in international police operations. The United Nations international civilian police system is the primary mechanism for providing civilian police assistance in multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions as of February 29, 2004. As of February 29, 2004, international civilian police assistance is provided in multilateral operations with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476 officers. Other countries with over 100 officers include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. Kosovo has the largest UNCIVPOL mission with over 75% of officers, while other missions are in Liberia. As of February 29, 2004, international civilian police assistance is provided in multilateral operations with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions. Kosovo has the largest UNCIVPOL mission with over 75% of officers, while other missions are in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. The United States provided police assistance in peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti in the early to mid-1990s. The United States and European Union member states have provided police assistance in multilateral operations in countries like Somalia and Haiti. The US has also developed police training programs in Somalia through the Justice Department's ICITAP. Many European Union member states, along with organizations like the OSCE and EU, have been involved in providing police assistance and training in various countries. The OSCE has played a role in establishing a new police academy and training police forces in Kosovo. The OSCE and EU have been involved in providing police assistance and training in various countries, including Kosovo and Bosnia. The EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the United Nations in January 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in December 2003. The EU assumed responsibility for police missions in Bosnia and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2003. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic policing and human rights. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Charter-driven principles of peacekeeping governing civilian police include consent, cooperation, impartiality, and minimal use of force. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides political and executive direction for all components of the operation in the field. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations oversees civilian policing activities, including policy, planning, recruitment, and deployment of international civilian police officers. Training-related activities are also managed within the organization. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations oversees civilian policing activities, including recruitment, deployment, and administration of international civilian police officers. Training is managed by the UNDPKO training unit. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field report to the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner under the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative. The Brahimi Panel report addresses problems in the U.N. peacekeeping system and proposes reforms. The Brahimi Panel report is the authoritative analysis of problems in the U.N. peacekeeping system and proposes reforms to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for deploying civilian police officers effectively. It recommends actions to improve recruitment and training processes for police-contributing Member States. The Brahimi Panel report recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for deploying civilian police officers effectively, including the establishment of a \"ready roster\" of qualified CivPols by Member States, development of an on-call list of experts for mission planning, regional partnerships for joint police training, and the identification of national points of contact on CivPol matters. Additionally, the UNDPKO held three conferences between March 1998 and mid-August 2000. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with U.N. policing operations and propose solutions. Donor countries reached consensus on addressing recruitment, training, deployment, and related issues. Donor countries reached near consensus on proposals to address problems with recruitment, training, deployment, and related issues. Recommendations included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system, improving training, pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment, and addressing procedural and organizational impediments to efficient operations. The UNDPKO seminar recommendations proposed pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment and addressed procedural and organizational impediments to efficient operations. Some Brahimi panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations have been implemented, but significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. The following sections discuss recruitment, training, and deployment issues, recommended reforms, and the status of implementation. The curr_chunk discusses the perceived problems in recruitment, training, and deployment, along with the Brahimi and UNDPKO seminar reforms recommended to address these issues. It also touches on the constraints on UNCIVPOL reform in these areas. Some progress has been made in other areas since the Brahimi Panel report, such as the reform of operational and internal management of UNDPKO, which is outside the scope of this report. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, focusing on reform and restructuring instead of monitoring, advising, and training. This doctrinal shift emphasized the need for more qualified law enforcement personnel working with other rule of law professionals. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring. This required more qualified law enforcement personnel to integrate their activities with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing the need for more qualified law enforcement personnel to integrate with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift may strain U.N. Member States by requiring additional well-trained police experts, which could be challenging given current demands. Some analysts raise concerns about the controversial nature of this approach within the U.N. CivPol system, where the primary focus is seen as building local police capacity. The UNDPKO and CPD perspective within the U.N. CivPol system is focused on building local police services capacity. The United Nations has created a new rule of law unit to incorporate a full range of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has made efforts to increase the use of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations by establishing a new rule of law unit. However, progress in integrating rule of law components is seen as \"lagging\" according to a recent report, as the UNDPKO has faced challenges in obtaining the necessary personnel for planning rule of law operations. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police for peacekeeping operations, leading to uneven results and a lack of experienced personnel. The United Nations struggles with recruiting police officers who meet minimum standards and lack experience in community policing and human rights. Additionally, there are difficulties in recruiting officers with specialized skills, and a lack of a comprehensive civilian police strategy. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting police officers with specialized skills due to the absence of a comprehensive civilian police strategy. This hinders the determination of mission needs and the recruitment of suitable personnel for UNCIVPOL missions. The United Nations struggles to recruit civilian police officers with the necessary skills for UNCIVPOL missions. Member States are only required to provide officers who meet basic criteria, such as a minimum age of 25, five years of police service with community policing experience, proficiency in an official U.N. language, possession of a driver's license, ability to operate a four-wheel drive vehicle, and meeting medical requirements. Since 1996, the United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting civilian police officers for UNCIVPOL missions. Analysts note that some personnel lack essential skills like language proficiency, driving ability, and firearms experience, despite U.N. efforts to enhance recruitment quality. Executive authority missions require officers with firearms expertise, while pre-selection testing and training in contributing countries are recommended but not mandatory. Since 1996, the United Nations has sent Selection Assistance Teams (SATs) to guide Member States in selecting police candidates for monitoring missions. Some retraining and retesting of basic requirements continue upon arrival in missions like the U.N. Mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Recruitment for specialized skills in monitoring missions has been challenging, with retesting of basic requirements accounting for a significant portion of the induction period. This has led to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. UNDPKO has had more success in recruiting for general skills than for specialists in areas such as training and investigations. Recruitment for specialized skills in monitoring missions has been challenging, with high repatriation costs and deployment delays. UNDPKO has had more success in recruiting for general skills than for specialists in areas such as training and investigations. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations emphasize the importance of advance recruitment to improve the quality of recruits and speed up deployment. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations highlight the need for advance recruitment of personnel to improve quality and speed up deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report suggested establishing national \"ready rosters\" of trained CivPol personnel under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements for quick deployment. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommended creating national \"ready rosters\" of trained CivPol personnel under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements for quick deployment. This includes serving police officers and recently retired officers who meet the requirements. Additionally, the UNSAS should be enhanced by establishing an effective ready roster of international police personnel through increased participation, job descriptions, and specialization identification. The UNSAS recommendations proposed enhancing the system by creating an effective ready roster of international police personnel through increased participation, job descriptions, and specialization identification. Despite progress, a 2003 evaluation found that too few states have created national pools of candidates for international operations. The 2003 evaluation found that too few states have created national pools of candidates for international operations, leading to a lack of individual candidates. The report recommended replacing 'bidding for slots' with real candidates with professional experience and familiarity with UN rules and procedures. The Brahimi Panel Report also called for the UN to maintain an 'on-call list of 100 police officers and related experts' available on short notice for advance missions. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended maintaining an on-call list of 100 police officers and experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for specialized expertise and leadership in new missions. 10 out of 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. The United Nations has made efforts to recruit specialized personnel for new missions, including training exercises to improve efficiency. Since spring 2003, SAT visits now consider substantive skills in selection criteria, such as management, planning, training, mentoring, and criminal investigations. The United Nations has improved recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in selection criteria since spring 2003. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures that hinder recruitment efforts, including the lack of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. In a U.N. audit issued in 2001, analysts criticized the lack of standardized criteria for determining civilian police numbers and skills matching for missions. The audit also faulted UNDPKO for inconsistent application of assessment systems. The U.N. audit in 2001 criticized UNDPKO for not consistently applying assessment systems to match skills appropriately for missions. It highlighted that civilian police personnel were performing non-policing functions, reducing the number available for policing tasks. Administrative functions accounted for eight percent of personnel in mission headquarters. Administrative functions, such as personnel, procurement, databases, and logistics, made up eight percent of police officers in UNMIBH, UNMIK, and UNTAET. Training for police-contributing Member States varied, leading to challenges in assembling a coherent UNCIVPOL force. The lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training among well-qualified personnel can undermine the effectiveness of a UNCIVPOL mission. Impediments to assembling a coherent force include officers from up to 40 countries who have little relevant training or mission-specific briefings. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training for UN missions. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel for UN missions. Inadequate training is attributed to a lack of experienced police trainers with peacekeeping expertise. Experts have identified three main reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training for civilian police personnel in UN missions: lack of experienced trainers, insufficient resources for training programs, and wide variations in national training programs. Recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises in line with U.N. standard operating procedures. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations focused on improving pre-deployment training for civilian police personnel in UN missions. They suggested developing regional partnerships for joint training exercises and using U.N. educational materials to pre-train personnel for rapid deployment. However, there is limited evidence of member states moving towards regional training partnerships. The Stimson Center notes limited progress in member states forming regional training partnerships, except for the European Union. The UNDPKO has made efforts to enhance pre-deployment training by providing training publications and developing common training standards. Training specialists also visit member states to offer guidance on pre-deployment training programs. UNDPKO has developed common training standards, including standardized \"generic training modules\" to ensure uniformity in peacekeeper competence. PDD-71 highlighted training as a way for the US to enhance other nations' capabilities in CivPol operations. Training and preparedness for coalition peace operations should remain a national responsibility. The United States can contribute to enhancing other nations' CivPol capabilities through tailored training packages provided by the State Department's INL office. The State Department's INL office aims to provide tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested, with appropriate funding. The new CivPol program seeks to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent, although details are still being finalized. Deployment plans are also being discussed. The State Department is looking to acquire capabilities to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent. Deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, recruiting personnel, and coordinating contributions from multiple nations. Deployment times historically range from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The deployment of UNCIVPOL missions historically takes six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays, including the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient equipment supply. Recommendations were made to address these issues. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations aimed to address deployment delays in UNCIVPOL missions by recommending the establishment of a reserve corps of mission leadership, improving standby arrangements, and ensuring a sufficient supply of equipment. They defined an effective deployment period of four to 12 weeks after Security Council authorization, with full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. The Brahimi Panel report recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after a Security Council mandate. There are concerns about meeting the 30-90 day rapid deployment timeframe for military and police personnel due to constraints on rapid deployment. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations highlighted constraints on rapid deployment, including the U.N. system's limited capacity for concurrent missions and the need for contributing states to quickly deploy well-trained civilian police personnel. Reforms are underway for the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements to address these issues. The United Nations is working on reforms to improve rapid deployment of civilian police personnel by developing a 100-person on-call roster and pre-packaging equipment for quick deployment at the beginning of new missions. The procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy have also been enhanced. The UN has improved procurement and management of deployment stocks at UNLB in Italy for peace missions. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many UN Member States have generic rapid deployment programs but lack the capability to deploy rapidly. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the U.S. CivPol program, recruiting civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies for missions. Unlike other countries, the United States lacks a large national police force for deployment. The State Department recruits civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies through contractors like DynCorp International and Civilian Police International LLC for missions. The State Department has contracted companies like DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deploying CivPol personnel. Additional contracts were issued to other companies for the same purpose. The State Department has contracted companies like DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deploying CivPol personnel. These companies will bid on contracts to deploy CivPol personnel, funded through various State Department bureaus. U.S. CivPol officers receive a base salary of $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. U.S. CivPol officers receive a base salary ranging from $50,000-100,000 depending on the mission, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. The total cost of U.S. CivPol personnel varies by mission, with recent annual costs ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq, covering salary, equipment, transportation, and support services. The cost of U.S. CivPol personnel in Kosovo includes salary, equipment, transportation, and MWR support. In Iraq, the cost also covers security, food, and housing, with expenses covered by the United Nations. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop in Iraq in September 2003 to be around $179,000. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop in Iraq in September 2003 to range from $179,000 to $206,000 based on different rotation schedules. Additionally, as of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international CivPol missions, including four in U.N. missions like Kosovo. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international CivPol missions, including deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone under U.N. missions, as well as in Afghanistan and Iraq as unilateral U.S. contributions. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international missions, including deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The United States also provided police officers for mission liaison in Vienna, Austria, and to monitor high-profile prisoners in Israel. U.S. policymakers have acknowledged challenges in recruiting and deploying qualified CivPol personnel, with PDD-71 aimed at enhancing U.S. capabilities. The U.S. has acknowledged challenges in recruiting and deploying qualified CivPol personnel for international police programs. PDD-71 aims to enhance U.S. response capacities by improving operational activities and providing guidance for recruitment, training, management, and deployment of CivPol personnel. The policy also focuses on improving the capacity of foreign police to participate in peace operations. The U.S. CivPol system faces challenges in recruitment, training, management, and deployment. Analysts highlight the need for improvements despite some positive changes in recent years. The U.S. CivPol system is facing challenges in recruitment, training, management, and deployment. Analysts emphasize the need for continued improvements, despite some positive changes in recent years. The Department of State has issued contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment in international police service. The Department of State has contracted to establish a reserve cadre of 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment in international police service. The contractor will handle recruitment, training, and procurement services to facilitate the deployment of well-qualified CivPols without starting recruitment and training activities from scratch each time. The bidding proposal for the new cadre of U.S. civilian police aims to streamline recruitment, selection, and training activities for international CivPol operations. The State Department's decision to award contracts to multiple companies has raised concerns about the expeditiousness of the process. The State Department's decision to award contracts for the new CivPol cadre program to multiple companies has raised concerns about the process expeditiousness and potential additional costs and delays. The extent to which the original RFP provisions apply to the new contracts is unclear as they have not been made public. Some analysts fear that advantages of the new CivPol cadre program may be offset by costs and delays. The extent to which original RFP provisions apply to new contracts is unclear as details have not been made public. Experts have debated the effectiveness of recruiting police officers for U.N. missions and unilateral dispatch to Iraq. DynCorp and other companies recruit officers from state and local law enforcement agencies, leading to staffing issues in municipal and state departments due to call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces for homeland security. Some analysts believe that the United States is facing staffing issues in municipal and state police departments due to the call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces for homeland security, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The current contracting system may not be attracting high-quality recruits as departments are reluctant to allow their best officers to take extended leaves. The United States faces staffing issues in police departments due to military call-ups, hindering recruitment of high-quality officers. Providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing officers to international missions could improve recruitment. The recruitment of individual U.S. police officers for international missions lacks financial incentives and cohesion, leading to varied UNCIVPOL forces. Some analysts argue that the selection criteria do not accurately reflect mission requirements. Some analysts argue that the U.S. selection criteria for civilian police candidates do not accurately reflect mission requirements. Criteria include U.S. citizenship, work experience as a sworn civilian law enforcement officer, an unblemished record, a valid driver's license, physical and psychological tests, a U.S. passport, and English communication skills. The Department of State requires candidates to have an unblemished record, valid driver's license, ability to drive a standard transmission 4x4 vehicle, excellent health, valid U.S. passport, and ability to communicate in English. They also need to qualify with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. Recruitment goals for basic and specialized skills are being met, with expanded qualifications for missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. Recruiting high-quality personnel remains a challenge. The State Department is improving recruiting for specialized skills, with expanded qualifications for missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The new CivPol cadre program aims to address the problem of recruiting high-quality personnel by including specialists in nearly 55% of the total cadre. Minimum qualifications for police officers include interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills, knowledge of international police standards, and experience in multicultural environments. The CivPol cadre program aims to have nearly 55% of the total cadre comprised of specialists. Minimum qualifications for police officers include interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills, knowledge of international police standards, and experience in multicultural environments. Selected individuals will receive annual training in essential policing skills recognized in the United States. The training is intended to attract high-quality officers to the program. The training program for U.S. CivPols aims to attract high-quality officers by offering training recognized in the United States. The specific details and funding for training all members of the program are still unclear. The training program for U.S. CivPols aims to attract high-quality officers by offering recognized training. However, the training for the potentially 6,000 members in the program is unclear and complicated by varying levels of skills among recruited police officers. Some experts find the current training program insufficient, with U.S. police officers undergoing pre-deployment training known as Police Assessment, Selection, and Training (P.A.S.T). The current U.S. CivPol program's pre-deployment training, known as Police Assessment, Selection, and Training (P.A.S.T), is considered insufficient. The training curriculum includes topics such as United Nations and peace operations, mission overview, team building, human rights, and personal safety. The new State Department CivPol cadre program includes training on mission overview, U.S. military in peace operations, civil-military relations, team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, contractor logistical support, personal safety, defensive tactics, use of police baton and aerosol subject restraint, driving, language, and firearms tests. The curriculum aims to meet nation-wide Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The new State Department CivPol cadre program is developing an improved training curriculum to meet Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The program includes ongoing training courses in policing skills, specialized training, and in-service training, with plans for recognition and certification from U.S. and select foreign law enforcement organizations. Additional annual training is also being considered. Some concerns have been raised about potential higher training costs under the new three-contractor cadre system. The new CivPol cadre program includes ongoing training courses in policing skills, specialized training, and in-service training. Concerns have been raised about potential higher training costs under the new three-contractor cadre system. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days following a U.N. Security Council authorization. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days following authorization, but falls short of expectations in proposed legislation calling for deployment capability within 15 days. Concerns exist about maintaining this deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The U.S. CivPol contingent may struggle to maintain its deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor in charge would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and provide logistical support to enhance operational capabilities. The contractor would develop a logistics support team to provide advanced logistical and administrative support for the U.S. police contingent, potentially decreasing deployment time. It is unclear if these provisions apply to the new system contracts and how deployments may be affected by new bidding processes. European countries typically deploy police from their national forces for international CivPol missions. European countries deploy police from their national forces for international CivPol missions, except for the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities since 1999. European governments, including the European Union, have been working on reforming their deployment systems to enhance international CivPol capabilities. In 2000, the EU agreed to establish a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations. In 2000, the EU agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for international peace operations by 2003, as part of the European Security and Defense Policy. In December 1999, the Helsinki Summit of European heads of state and government adopted a Police Action Plan, establishing guidelines for police selection, training, command, and control. The EU also established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) for flexible funding of civilian crisis management operations, with up to 5,000 police officers committed by EU Member States as of late February 2004. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) for flexible funding of civilian crisis management operations. EU Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Member States also committed to provide up to 13 rapidly deployable police units and two headquarters units for police missions. In November 2003, personnel from 22 European countries attended a joint exercise in Italy to test operations. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003 in Bosnia and Hercegovia, aiming to establish sustainable policing arrangements in accordance with European and international best practices. Two Member States offered headquarters units for police missions, with personnel from 22 European countries testing inter-operability of integrated police units in Italy. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Hercegovia to establish sustainable policing arrangements. The mission consists of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states with an annual budget of US $47.2 million. In December 2003, the EU began its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel and a budget of US $18.6 million. On December 15, 2003, the EU launched its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. The budget for the mission is US$18.6 million (15 million Euros), with start-up costs of $9.1 million (7.3 million Euros). Despite meeting goals for police officer commitments, some analysts doubt the effectiveness of EU crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities. The EU launched a police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 personnel, meeting goals for police officer commitments. Analysts are skeptical about the effectiveness of EU crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities due to Member States' reluctance to surrender national sovereignty. The OSCE is also enhancing its operational capabilities, with 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries. The OSCE has 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries, with a capability for rapid deployment of experts through the REACT program created at the Istanbul Summit in 1999. The Heads of State and government of OSCE participating States established the Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. The program allows participating States to create databases of qualified civilian experts, including CivPols, to promote security. The REACT program enables participating States to establish databases of qualified civilian experts in various areas to promote security. The objective is to deploy personnel within two to eight weeks for specific missions. OSCE and its 55 participating States have been implementing and improving the program since its establishment in April 2001. Since its establishment in April 2001, the OSCE and its 55 participating States have taken steps to implement and improve the REACT program, including creating national websites for recruitment and providing mechanisms for applications via the OSCE website. Some participating States prefer not to nominate individuals until specific field requirements are known, but numerical commitments have been provided. The OSCE developed a framework of standards for recruiting qualified candidates based on past and current field activities. Through REACT, the OSCE recruits CivPols with the necessary skills for advising and mentoring. The OSCE developed a staffing matrix for recruiting qualified CivPols with specific requirements including police training, experience, English proficiency, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement. The OSCE recruits police officers with specific requirements such as graduation from a recognized police training school, active police experience, English proficiency, negotiation and interpersonal skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and the ability to operate police radio equipment. Law enforcement administrators with eight to 20 years of experience in law enforcement and police management are also recruited. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced three bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 1414 aims to enhance UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating NATO capabilities for post-conflict efforts, and S. 2127 aims to improve the U.S.'s ability to respond to crises abroad. H.R. 2616 and S. 2127 propose enhancing international capabilities for post-conflict stabilization and crisis response. Analysts suggest options to address deficiencies in training and law enforcement institutions. H.R. 1414 focuses on reforming the U.N. Civilian Police System. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and address recruitment and training problems. It calls for negotiations within the United Nations to establish a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC). The bill, H.R. 1414, proposes reforms to enhance the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL and address recruitment and training issues. It calls for negotiations within the United Nations to establish a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peace operations. The bill, H.R. 1414, proposes the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peace operations, with a focus on arrangements for a standing or on-call force composed of law enforcement professionals trained for civilian policing functions in U.N. peace operations. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations, with a focus on trained law enforcement professionals equipped for civilian policing functions. It also emphasizes the need for appropriate resources, including funding, equipment, training, and staffing. The bill aims to establish a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations, focusing on trained law enforcement professionals and addressing deployment and enforcement gaps. The bill H.R. 1414 proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to address deployment and enforcement gaps in peace operations, aiming to reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks. The bill H.R. 1414 proposes a professional U.N. police corps to enhance security and reduce the reliance on combat soldiers for civilian police tasks in peacekeeping operations. Critics are concerned about the potential cost and challenges of establishing a standing corps. The bill H.R. 1414 proposes a professional U.N. police corps to enhance security and reduce reliance on combat soldiers for civilian police tasks in peacekeeping operations. Opponents fear the establishment of a costly and problematic standing corps, with concerns about funding and management capacity within the United Nations. Many analysts express concerns about the sustainability of funding a permanent UNCPC through voluntary contributions rather than mandatory assessments. There are also worries about the United Nations' limited management capacity in administering such a corps. Some fear that a permanent police corps could lead to the infringement of national sovereignty, although proponents of H.R. 1414 argue that the U.S. could veto any proposed use of the corps. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, proposes new mechanisms for security in post-conflict situations, including the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current ad hoc U.S. CivPol system. This reserve would serve as an interim police force overseas and train indigenous civilian police forces. Congress would establish the civilian police reserve through Section 8 of the bill. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current ad hoc U.S. CivPol system. It suggests training and equipping indigenous civilian police forces and calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services in such situations. Congress would establish the civilian police reserve through Section 8 of the bill. The proposal suggests creating a new NATO mechanism for military and policing services in post-conflict situations. It calls for training and equipping selected NATO units to provide security in reconstruction scenarios, with an \"integrated security support component\" for this purpose. The bill authorizes the President to deploy personnel capable of ensuring civilian security, including acting as a police force. Selected units should possess constabulary skills for specified tasks. The proposed legislation aims to commit personnel with constabulary skills to support civilian security, including acting as a police force. Tasks include controlling belligerent groups, performing anti-corruption tasks, and supporting police investigations. The proposed legislation aims to commit personnel with constabulary skills to support civilian security by controlling belligerent groups, performing anti-corruption tasks, and supporting police investigations. Proponents argue that a civilian police reserve would help bridge the deployment gap and expedite the deployment of U.S. civilian police. A civilian police reserve could bridge the deployment gap by providing on-call officers to expedite U.S. civilian police deployment. There is debate over whether to establish a reserve in line with the State Department's private sector model or a new government reserve force. Supporters of the private contractor model argue for quicker response times and avoiding new government bureaucracies. Opponents of the private contractor model for civilian police reserve argue that commercial contractors may lack dedication and flexibility in unpredictable situations, similar to limitations in military operations. Opponents of government-sponsored reserve argue that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force efficiently, but only if civilian law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists. Proponents believe a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment and more responsive to U.S. policy. Proponents argue that a government reserve CivPol force would be more cohesive, accountable, and have better quality recruits compared to a privately-contracted force. They also believe that a government agency could draw qualified personnel from local and state police departments more easily. A government reserve CivPol force could better guarantee quality recruits by establishing more stringent screening mechanisms and offering compensation to departments providing personnel. Pre-deployment training and cohesion could be influenced by the type of reserve force model. The desirability of pre-deployment training and cohesion could impact the effectiveness of a government-sponsored reserve force compared to a contractor model. Training together like U.S. military reservists and coordinating with military forces could make a government-created reserve force more reliable. NATO constabulary capability could help bridge enforcement gaps through NATO. The NATO constabulary capability could bridge enforcement gaps by providing a full range of skills in post-conflict situations. Some question whether NATO is the right venue for a force with policing functions, as military forces may send inappropriate signals to civil authorities and the local population. Some analysts argue that using military forces for policing functions in NATO may duplicate EU structures and create friction in US-European relations. They suggest additional provisions on equipment, training, and coordination with the military to be included in the bill. Some analysts argue for additional provisions in the bill regarding equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment and ensure standardized training for U.S. and international police reservists. This is seen as crucial to prevent past operational problems from recurring in the future. Critics argue that creating police reserves through S. 2127 may deplete existing resources and lead to tensions with local and state governments. Some suggest joint training with U.S. and other military forces to avoid past operational issues. S. 2127, introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden, aims to strengthen civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond effectively to overseas crises. Critics fear that creating police reserves through this bill may strain existing resources and cause tensions with local and state governments. The bill S. 2127 aims to reorganize government structures to enhance the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond to overseas crises. It proposes to allocate $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve, consisting of federal employees and non-government personnel trained for missions. The bill S. 2127 proposes to establish a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve, comprising federal employees and non-government personnel trained for missions. Within three years, 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be trained for this force. The legislation aims to address delays in deploying rule of law personnel. The legislation aims to address delays in deploying rule of law personnel, but does not specify the types of personnel to be recruited or the extent of their expertise. Many experts suggest improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel. The development of a Stability Force is being considered for improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel to bridge the deployment gap. Training adjustments in Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor were made on a case-by-case basis, highlighting the need for adequate and appropriate training. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity for training. Some analysts suggest increased funding for police training to meet international needs, as training adjustments were made in Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity for tailored training packages when requested. Increased police training funding is recommended to address the prohibitive costs for many nations. The State Department's proposal includes provisions for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, pending decisions on program details and funding availability. Increase International Capability for Constabulary Forces by strengthening existing capabilities in some nations and creating new capabilities in others. H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a unit within NATO for constabulary functions. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more force than regular policing. H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a unit within NATO for constabulary functions, which involve tasks requiring less force than combat but more force than routine law enforcement activities. These tasks include regulating peoples' movements for safety, intervening in civil violence, and dispersing unruly public demonstrations. Constabulary forces are trained in military and policing skills to intervene in civil violence, looting, riots, and public disturbances. They are essential in post-conflict areas and often deployed on peacekeeping missions with their own communication and logistical support. Constabulary police are crucial in post-conflict areas and peacekeeping missions, equipped with their own support. They can deploy rapidly as formed units, working together efficiently. Analysts suggest specialized paramilitary units for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. Many analysts advocate for specialized paramilitary units to handle constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations, citing examples from countries like Italy, France, and Spain. These units can be strained by high deployment rates in multiple U.N. peacekeeping missions. Several analysts suggest that specialized paramilitary units, like those in Italy, France, and Spain, are often strained by high deployment rates in U.N. peacekeeping missions. There are discussions within the U.S. Army about developing its own active duty constabulary force to support military police in peacekeeping operations. Army leaders have been resistant to this idea despite potential shortages in MP capabilities during high deployment rates. Army analysts and policymakers are considering restructuring the U.S. Army to better support peacekeeping operations, despite long-standing resistance from Army leaders who prioritize the primary warfighting mission. Many analysts question the effectiveness of military forces if they do not establish conditions for lasting peace after interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Many analysts question the effectiveness of military forces in establishing lasting peace after interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, advocating for adaptable Army forces capable of handling security tasks in various conflict environments. This includes the use of constabulary forces as an intermediary security force for peace operations. Constabulary forces are seen as an intermediary security force for peace operations, capable of handling violent situations beyond CivPol's capabilities. Analysts suggest that using constabulary forces can reduce the reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities and shorten their withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Despite potential advantages, it is uncertain if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities. Analysts are unsure if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities for peacekeeping operations. Some suggest developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the gap in peace operations. Some analysts propose the development of rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to ensure sustainable security, including judges, prosecutors, and prison personnel. The United States currently deploys personnel with experience in justice. The United States and international partners aim to rapidly deploy a full range of rule of law professionals, including judges, prosecutors, and prison personnel. Current deployment methods through Department of Justice contracts are seen as insufficient by some analysts. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at the United States Institute for Peace, advocates for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" in intervention forces. This proposal aims to address the current system's limitations in deploying necessary personnel promptly. Perito proposes integrating military and civilian personnel to create a \"U.S. force for stability\" as part of intervention forces. The U.S. stability force would consist of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. Perito proposes a \"U.S. force for stability\" comprised of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals to address post-conflict security gaps. The deployment of these forces would be concurrent to ensure immediate security and bridge deployment gaps. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions as soon as security conditions permit. Perito proposes a \"U.S. force for stability\" consisting of military forces, civilian constabulary units, and police to address post-conflict security gaps. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, transitioning from military to perimeter security roles. Perito's model suggests a transition from military to civilian personnel for law enforcement functions, with a focus on restoring public safety and the rule of law. Perito's model proposes a shift from military to civilian personnel for law enforcement, mirroring the NATO military and U.N. civilian security forces in Kosovo. Recommendations from a November 2003 National Defense University report also suggest deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces to expedite the transfer of nation-building responsibilities to civilians. The National Defense University (NDU) report recommends deploying civilian \"stabilization and reconstruction\" personnel with combat forces to transfer nation-building responsibilities. It suggests creating a standing interagency team and an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recommends establishing an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recommends the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. This agency would be responsible for preparing, managing, and deploying a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians, as well as a Civilian Stability Operations Reserve of non-government civilians with related expertise for rapid deployment. The proposal suggests the creation of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians and a Civilian Stability Operations Reserve of non-government civilians for rapid deployment. This model aims to deploy rule of law personnel early in operations to enhance long-term stability and democracy, potentially allowing for earlier military withdrawal. The proposal suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve for rapid deployment to enhance stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. This would require the development of constabulary capabilities within the military and the recruitment of police personnel by a new federal agency. The proposal suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve for rapid deployment to enhance stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. This would involve developing constabulary capabilities within the military and recruiting police personnel through a new federal agency, potentially controversial due to restructuring military forces and debates on government-employment versus government-contracted models for CivPol deployments. The proposal suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve for rapid deployment to enhance stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. Arguments related to restructuring military forces and perspectives on government-employment versus government-contracted models for CivPol deployments are discussed. The model offers advantages in establishing security more rapidly in crisis countries, depending on recruitment and hiring methods. Perito favors federalizing the CivPol component of the stability force. The ease of deployment for a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve depends on the recruitment and hiring methods. Perito suggests federalizing the CivPol component for quicker deployment. Personnel hired through a federal employment process may deploy slower than those under a reserve or stand-by system. Rapid deployment availability hinges on recruitment arrangements. The availability of personnel for rapid deployment may depend on recruitment arrangements. Law enforcement and rule of law personnel may require benefits similar to the U.S. military reserve component for immediate deployment. Sources: Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations website and EU Police fact sheet. Salaries for regular training for members of the U.S. military reserve component are similar to benefits required for rapid deployment of law enforcement and rule of law personnel. Sources include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations website, EU Police fact sheet, OMIK information from the OSCE website, and other relevant publications. The curr_chunk discusses various sources related to police in peace operations, including books and publications. It also mentions the exclusion of U.N. civilian police missions with fewer than 100 authorized or deployed personnel. The American Experience with Police in Peace Operations, Clementsport, Canada: The Canadian Peacekeeping Press, 2002. This chart excludes U.N. civilian police missions with fewer than 100 personnel. International police groups were sent to advise and train local forces before WWI. European nations sent police units to the Ottoman Empire and Albania in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in a specific operation. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in the Congo in 1960, with Ghanaian and Nigerian contingents assisting the local police. In 1962-63, the United Nations provided a U.N. Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch control. The United Nations provided UNTEA to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule in 1962-63. The UNFICYP was the first operation to use UNCIVPOL, a multilateral U.N. police force, in Cyprus starting in 1964. UNFICYP CivPols assisted Cypriot police in maintaining order and diffusing tensions. The term UNCIVPOL was first used in the UNFICYP operation in Cyprus in 1964, where a multilateral U.N. police force assisted local police in maintaining order and diffusing tensions. Post-cold war operations from 1989 to 1992 focused on monitoring local police performance in countries like Namibia and Western Sahara. The UNCIVPOL operations from 1989 to 1992 focused on monitoring local police performance in Namibia and Western Sahara. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process leading to independence, with unarmed CivPol monitors assisting in the mission. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process leading to independence, with unarmed CivPol monitors assisting in the mission. UNTAG set the three main tasks for early monitoring missions: accompanying local police, investigating public complaints about the police, and supervising police investigations. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia set tasks for early monitoring missions, including accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. MINURSO in Southwest Sahara aimed to conduct a referendum on the territory's future status, facing opposition from Morocco. Monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia operated in challenging environments with less established institutions. The UN conducted monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia in challenging environments with less established institutions. Despite limited mandates, additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary. Police monitors were also deployed in the UN Protection Force peacekeeping operation to new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. The UN Protection Force peacekeeping operation deployed CivPols to Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovia, and Macedonia for monitoring functions, but their missions were overwhelmed by armed conflict due to inadequate mandate and insufficient military forces. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large and ambitious peacekeeping operation with a strictly monitoring mandate. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) had a monitoring mandate focused on investigating complaints of political liberties and human rights violations. The UNTAC police mission shifted responsibilities in the field when Cambodian police failed to apprehend suspects cited by UNCIVPOLs. The UNTAC police unit in Cambodia focused on investigating complaints of political liberties and human rights violations. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, but these actions were deemed too late to make the operation effective due to deployment delays. The UNTAC police unit in Cambodia faced deployment delays, hindering its effectiveness in ensuring law and order. Despite efforts to address the issue, the mission had to adjust its focus from law enforcement to monitoring elections due to inadequate police numbers. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia initially faced deployment delays due to inadequate police numbers, leading to a shift in focus from law enforcement to monitoring elections. Recognizing the need for training, some civil police conducted makeshift training using their own manuals. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia faced challenges due to inadequate resources, leading to makeshift training by civil police. The lack of an independent judicial system hindered justice, resulting in the concept of deploying integrated \"justice packages.\" The lack of an independent judicial system in Cambodia hindered justice, leading to the idea of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" including justice and penal officials, as well as police officers. Police reform became a pivotal element in the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, aiming to put internal security forces under civilian control. The U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador played a crucial role in putting internal security forces under civilian control through unprecedented international assistance. This reform was established through peace accords in January 1992, ending El Salvador's civil war and calling for the dismantling of military-controlled security forces. The U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, established through peace accords in January 1992, ended the civil war by putting internal security forces under civilian control. The accords called for dismantling military-controlled security forces and creating a new National Civilian Police force. ONUSAL provided UNCIVPOLs to assist in the transition and police reform. ONUSAL, established in July 1991, provided UNCIVPOLs from March 1992 to assist in police reform and transition in El Salvador. Their mandate included cooperating in ensuring a smooth transition, overseeing the formation of a new police academy, and training recruits for the CNP force. The emphasis was on verification and field work. During a two-year transition period, ONUSAL oversaw the creation of a new police academy and trained recruits for the CNP force. The UNDP managed international contributions for this effort, with the US and Chile providing assistance. The establishment of the new police force was considered a success for El Salvador's reconciliation and democratization processes. The establishment of a new police force in El Salvador was considered a success for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes, with assistance from Spain, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Chile. Despite encountering significant problems, the success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. The success of establishing a new police force in El Salvador convinced governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions also had training and reform mandates, such as the Mozambique civilian police operation in 1994. The Mozambique civilian police operation in 1994 had a monitoring mission with a small training assistance component to support the Mozambican police. ONUMOZ was a precursor to later police reform missions, focusing on monitoring and verifying the reorganization and retraining of the Quick Reaction Police. After the formal UN operations in Mozambique, international police support continued through bilateral training programs, notably by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Training was a key aspect of UN missions in Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti, where concerted efforts were made for police reform and training. In Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti, international forces, including the U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF), focused on training and reform efforts to restore order and provide humanitarian assistance.UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) in Somalia after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) in Somalia to restore order and provide humanitarian assistance after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. The ASF aimed to enforce locally agreed-upon laws and be controlled by the community, acting as a community police force present in 17 cities and towns. The ASF in Somalia was intended to enforce locally agreed-upon laws and be controlled by the community, acting as a community police force present in 17 cities and towns. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, reduce confusion about their role, minimize casualties, deal with ordinary criminal activity, and give Somalis responsibility for their own affairs. The ASF in Somalia aimed to reduce friction with the local population, minimize casualties, deal with criminal activity, create jobs, and provide income to unemployed Somalis. UNITAF supported the Somali police to act independently while allied military forces served as backup near police stations. Substantial assistance was provided by UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations for the ASF. The ASF in Somalia received substantial assistance from UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations. The UNDP paid salaries, provided equipment, and refurbished police stations. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts also supported the new force with uniforms and equipment. UNITAF provided surplus vehicles and radios from Saudi Arabia. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts, under UNDP auspices, provided uniforms, nightsticks, and whistles to the new force. UNITAF military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the United Arab Emirates offered training, weapons, and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program supplied food rations for ASF members and their families. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993 when ASF members were operating in Mogadishu. The World Food Program provided food rations for ASF members and their families. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, with ASF members operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities and towns. The ASF was considered a credible and popular police force. The U.N. announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994, despite challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction. The UN announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994, despite challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction. However, UN efforts faced obstacles due to inadequate staffing and funding, leading to delays in the arrival and training of UNCIVPOL members. The UN faced challenges in re-establishing a Somali police force due to delays in staffing and funding. Training programs with ICITAP collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity, leading to the withdrawal of ICITAP in June 1994 and UNCIVPOLs in March 1995. The training programs for Somali police officers collapsed due to escalating violence and insecurity, leading to the withdrawal of ICITAP in June 1994 and UNCIVPOLs in March 1995. The UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing police forces that offered protection to citizens, but by the end of the 1990s, there was a need for further development and reform of existing police forces. The UNITAF ASF achieved success in providing police forces for protection, but by the late 1990s, the need for police institution development and reform was recognized. The August 2000 Brahimi Panel Report recommended a shift in using civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. According to the panel, CivPol personnel should focus on building local police capacity. In Somalia and Haiti, the lack of commitment to support CivPol led to an \"enforcement gap\" in maintaining law and order post-conflict due to the absence of a widely-accepted peace accord. In post-conflict situations, military force may be necessary to maintain law and order when police forces are insufficient. The Somalia operation highlighted issues with international civilian police forces functioning without an effective cease-fire. The Somalia operation revealed problems with international civilian police forces in post-conflict situations, including the ineffectiveness without a cease-fire, diversity issues in training local police, and gaps in institutions and political settlements undermining police reform efforts. Similar challenges were seen in Haiti despite intensive U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts. The lack of adequate courts and prison systems, along with the absence of a political settlement, may hinder successful police reform efforts in the long term. In Haiti, U.S. and U.N. police reform initiatives over six years exposed institutional gaps. The U.S.-led Multilateral Force established the International Police Monitoring Force to train a new Haitian national police force. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed by the Multinational Force to train a new Haitian national police force. The IPM had about 820 monitors from 20 countries and supervised an interim public security force. The subsequent UN Mission in Haiti took over monitoring and training functions. The UNCIVPOL and subsequent UN missions in Haiti worked on professionalizing the Haitian police force, with coordination between military, MNF, and civilian police to maintain public security. The IPMs were slow to deploy with sufficient strength, leading to the need for intervention from the United States. The military and MNF worked together to establish public security in Haiti while the HNP was being trained and deployed. The United States adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals when necessary. MNF military police conducted patrols with IPMs and IPSF to fill deployment gaps before the HNP deployment. The interim public security force in Haiti was rapidly deployed to fill the gap before the planned deployment of the HNP. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training on patrolling and the use of force. The transition between the U.S.-led MNF and the U.N. operation in Haiti was smooth, with UNMIH military forces bridging the law enforcement gap. In Haiti, the transition from the U.S.-led MNF to the U.N. operation was smooth, with UNMIH military forces bridging the law enforcement gap. UNMIH provided rapid backup to UNCIVPOL, MPs for liaison, and continued military patrols to deter crime and political violence. HNP deployment led to UNCIVPOLs shifting to a mentoring role, with UNMIH monitoring HNP performance. Planners in the Haitian operations compensated for deployment and enforcement gaps. The transition in Haiti from the U.S.-led MNF to the U.N. operation was smooth, with UNMIH military forces bridging the law enforcement gap. UNCIVPOLs shifted to a mentoring role as HNP deployment occurred, with UNMIH monitoring HNP performance. Despite efforts to compensate for deployment and enforcement gaps, the overcrowded prisons and corrupt judicial system hindered public security establishment. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and creating Special Constabulary Units. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and creating Special Constabulary Units to address the \"Enforcement Gap\" in the region. This role was assigned by the December 1995 Dayton Accords to oversee a joint government and end the conflict among the three competing populations in Bosnia. The December 1995 Dayton Accords established a joint government in Bosnia overseen by the UN through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to end the conflict. The UN's responsibilities included monitoring, advising, training, and facilitating law enforcement activities within the IPTF mission. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was established to oversee law enforcement activities in Bosnia, including advising, training, and facilitating police forces. In January 2003, the European Union took over responsibility for monitoring and training police in Bosnia. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was established in Bosnia to oversee law enforcement activities, but proved inadequate in ensuring public order among hostile groups. In January 2003, the European Union took over responsibility for monitoring and training police in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia, established to oversee law enforcement, was found inadequate in maintaining public order among hostile groups. Concerns about its effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, with calls for a stronger mandate for international CivPol and a policing role for the NATO peacekeeping Implementation Force (IFOR). The early 1996 transfer of control in Sarajevo, with the relocation of residents, was seen as a test for the IPTF. The early 1996 transfer of control in Sarajevo was a test for the IPTF and IFOR. IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF, helping with planning and organization. The relocation process had minimal casualties, which was seen as a significant achievement. The relocation process in Sarajevo, overseen by IPTF with assistance from IFOR, had minimal casualties but revealed an \"enforcement gap\" as IPTF lacked authority and resources. This led to a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, seen as another U.N. failure. The flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs was seen as a U.N. failure, leading to a loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. The IPTF lacked law enforcement powers, taking almost a year to recover from its inability to meet exaggerated expectations. NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in late 1996, providing backup support to the IPTF. In late 1996, the smaller NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in Bosnia, providing backup support to the IPTF. Specialized units within the IPTF, including paramilitary forces, were developed to address the \"enforcement gap\" and maintain public order. Paramilitary and paramilitary-like police units from foreign nations, such as the Gendarmarie from France, the Carabinieri from Italy, and the Guardia Civil from Spain, were integrated into international CivPols in the late 1990s to fill a gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. This integration first occurred in Bosnia in 1998. In the late 1990s, paramilitary police units were integrated into international CivPols to bridge the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect officials and maintain public order. This successful model led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999. The formation of specialized police units in Bosnia in 1998 led to the creation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999, with mandates granting executive authority powers to international civilian police. In Kosovo and East Timor, international police forces were given executive authority powers due to the absence of legitimate local authority. NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo after the coalition air war against Serbia, with NATO providing military presence through KFOR and the UN overseeing civil matters. NATO and the United Nations provided security and civil administration in Kosovo through KFOR and UNMIK, while the OSCE oversaw the training of the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET managed civil administration during its transition period from 1999 to 2002. In Kosovo, NATO and the United Nations provided security and civil administration through KFOR and UNMIK, with the OSCE overseeing training of the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET managed civil administration during its transition period from 1999 to 2002, filling the security vacuum left by Indonesia's withdrawal. In East Timor, a security vacuum was filled by UNTAET after Indonesia's withdrawal, with a mandate for U.N. forces and INTERFET to exercise executive authority. However, the use of executive authority in such situations is seen as problematic and unlikely to be a wise choice in the future. In cases where local police forces exist but may be unsuited to perform their duties without vetting, practitioners and policymakers will make decisions on executive policing based on sovereignty considerations. Limited availability of international civilian police personnel makes recruiting and deploying them for executive authority challenging. In cases where local police forces may be unsuited without vetting, decisions on executive policing will be made based on sovereignty considerations."
