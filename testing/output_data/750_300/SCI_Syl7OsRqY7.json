    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies suggest they assume answers and evidence are close in a single document. A new model called Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines evidence from multiple documents. CFC includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module for scoring candidate answers by comparing occurrences across all documents with the query. These modules use hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to learn. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines evidence from multiple documents using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention. It achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, outperforming previous models by 3% accuracy.

Existing datasets focus on reasoning over localized sections of a single document, but this work emphasizes the ability to reason over multiple documents to answer questions effectively. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) focuses on multi-evidence question answering by aggregating evidence from multiple documents. Inspired by coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning, the CFC selects candidate answers based on support documents and a query. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a QA model that selects candidate answers based on support documents and a query.

On the TriviaQA dev set, reranking with CFC results in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain. The study also analyzes the contributions of different modules and model decisions. The study analyzes the performance contributions of different modules and model decisions in span extraction question answering models. Both the coarse-grain and fine-grain modules significantly contribute to model performance. Replacing self-attention layers with mean-pooling and bidirectional GRUs with unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. However, replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings leads to a significant performance drop, highlighting the importance of contextual encodings for this task. Model prediction errors across various lengths are shown in FIG2. The study highlights the importance of contextual encodings for span extraction question answering models. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs compared to the coarse-grain-only model due to difficulties in coreference resolution.

Ants, part of the family Formicidae, evolved from wasp-like ancestors about 99 million years ago. The populous island of Java contains over half of Indonesia's population. Ants, along with wasps and bees, are eusocial insects that evolved from wasp-like ancestors about 99 million years ago. Tasmania is an island state of Australia located to the south of the mainland. Tasmania is an island state of Australia, known for its distinctive node-like structure and elbowed antennae. It has a population of around 518,500, with a significant portion residing in the Greater Hobart precinct. New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, comprising two main landmasses - the North Island and the South Island. It is located east of Australia and south of Pacific island areas like New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Due to its remoteness, New Zealand was settled by humans later than other lands, leading to the development of a unique biodiversity. New Zealand, located across the Tasman Sea and south of Pacific islands like New Caledonia and Fiji, developed a unique biodiversity due to its late human settlement. The country's diverse topography, including sharp mountain peaks like the Southern Alps, is a result of tectonic uplift and volcanic activity. Wellington is the capital city, while Auckland is the most populous. New Zealand is home to a wide variety of flowering plants, with over 295,000 known species. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland. Angiosperms are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approximately 13,164 known genera, and around 295,383 known species. They are seed-producing plants distinguished by flowers, endosperm within seeds, and fruit production. The term \"angiosperm\" comes from Greek words meaning a plant that produces seeds within a casing or enclosure. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce fruits containing seeds. Pollination is essential for fertilization to occur, allowing plants to pass on their genetic information to the next generation. Insects are a diverse class of invertebrates with a chitinous exoskeleton, three-part body, compound eyes, and antennae. They play a crucial role in pollination, enabling seed plants to produce seeds for genetic information transfer to the next generation. Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, three-part body, compound eyes, and antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, with over a million described species. The Stenotritidae family is the smallest bee family with 21 species in Australia. The Stenotritidae family is the smallest bee family with 21 species in Australia. They are large, fast-flying bees that make burrows in the ground and provision masses in waterproof cells. Larvae do not spin cocoons, and fossil brood cells have been found in the Pleistocene. Stenotritidae bees are large, hairy, fast-flying insects that make burrows in the ground and provision masses in waterproof cells. Fossil brood cells of a stenotritid bee have been found in the Pleistocene. Wasps, belonging to the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita, are not bees or ants but share a common evolutionary ancestor with them."
