    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's child survival and maternal health programs from FY2001 to FY2008, highlighting the interconnected nature of global health programs. UNICEF's report in 2008 celebrated the decline in annual deaths among children under five years old. In 2008, UNICEF reported a 60% drop in annual deaths among children under five, with 9.7 million deaths in 2006. Despite the decrease, 26,000 children still die daily, with 90% of childhood deaths occurring before age five. Child mortality remains high, with 26,000 children under five dying each day. Most deaths occur before age five, with 37% in the neonatal period. Developing countries, especially in Africa, bear the brunt of child deaths. Neonatal infections and five diseases are major causes, with undernutrition contributing to half of these deaths. Child deaths are primarily caused by neonatal infections and five infectious diseases: acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), diarrhea, malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS. Undernutrition is a significant factor in up to half of these deaths. Monitoring maternal and child health is crucial as their mortality rates reflect overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) highlight the interconnected nature of health and development, with MDGs 4 and 5 aiming for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Supporters use the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to show the link between health and development, focusing on reducing child and maternal mortality rates. Progress in MDGs like undernourishment and access to clean water impacts these rates, as undernourished individuals are more vulnerable to infectious diseases. UNICEF found that lack of access to clean water is linked to higher maternal and child mortality rates, undernourished individuals are more likely to be impoverished and susceptible to infectious diseases. 62 countries, mostly in Africa, were not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival. Maternal health and child survival are closely connected, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. UNICEF emphasizes the link between child survival and maternal health, stating that over 500,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries where maternal mortality rates are significantly higher. The United Nations FAO suggests that these deaths could be prevented with access to adequate diets, clean water, sanitation, literacy, and healthcare during pregnancy. Maternal deaths in developing countries could be prevented with access to adequate diets, clean water, sanitation, literacy, and healthcare during pregnancy. UNICEF estimates that 20% of maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and 75% are caused by obstetric complications. Maternal mortality rates are higher for mothers under 20 years old. Complications during pregnancy, such as hemorrhage, sepsis, and hypertensive disorders, are more common in mothers under 20 years old. These young mothers also face risks of delivering low birth weight babies and experiencing pregnancy-related complications, leading to higher mortality rates for both mothers and babies. Adolescents give birth to 15 million infants annually, with girls aged 15 to 19 years at a higher risk. Complications during pregnancy are the leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds worldwide. Adolescents give birth to 15 million infants annually, with higher morbidity and mortality rates for both mothers and babies. Girls aged 15 to 19 are at a higher risk of dying from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. In Mali, the maternal mortality rate for 15 to 19-year-olds is 178 per 100,000 live births, compared to 32 per 100,000 for women aged 20 to 34. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal death, accounting for about 34% from 1990 to 2006. The maternal mortality rate is higher for girls aged 15-19 compared to women aged 20-34. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal death, with varying rates among regions. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. Regions with low proportions of skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 65% in south Asia and 99% in industrialized nations. The probability of dying from pregnancy-related causes is one in 22 for African women, one in 59 for Asian women, and one in 8,000 for women in industrialized nations. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide. In industrialized nations, one in every 8,000 women faces the risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes. UNICEF found that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum health workforce standard among the 68 priority countries. South Africa and Swaziland are the only two sub-Saharan African countries among the 68 priority countries that have reached the minimum standard for health workforce density. Child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with ample health workers, clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and access to nutritious food. Sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers, with 36 in Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers globally. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed worldwide, with countries in Africa needing to increase their health workforce by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with half of the funds allocated from FY2001-FY2008. Research supported by USAID in the 1970s and 1980s has led to the development of interventions and technologies that have saved millions of children's lives. Research supported by USAID in the 1970s and 1980s has led to the development of interventions and technologies now used to save millions of children. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to global child survival efforts, with half allocated from FY2001-FY2008. The agency focuses on addressing six major health issues that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address major health issues like malaria, HIV/AIDS, measles, and neonatal complications, which cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. Undernutrition contributes to half of these deaths. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization highlights that hunger and malnutrition weaken children's bodies and immune systems, leading to nearly 10 million child deaths annually. WHO-supported studies from 1991 to 2001 found that malnourished children under five are at higher risk of mortality. Good nutrition is crucial for child survival and health. WHO-supported studies from 1991 to 2001 found that malnourished children under five are at higher risk of mortality, with those who are moderately to severely underweight being five to eight times more likely to die of infectious diseases. About 45% of children who died after contracting measles and over 60% of children who died after severe diarrhea were malnourished. Good nutrition is essential for child survival and health. Malnourished children under five have a higher risk of mortality, with those who are underweight being five to eight times more likely to die. Malnourishment impairs the immune system, making children more susceptible to diseases like diarrhea, pneumonia, and measles. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation to improve child health. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification to improve child health by adding vital immune-building micronutrients to processed foods. Funds are also used to expand research on biofortified crops, enhancing the micronutrient content of basic foods. USAID funds research on biofortified crops to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods like maize, beans, and sweet potatoes. Micronutrient supplementation and nutrition programs are integrated with other interventions to address malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants in most countries are exclusively breastfed. According to USAID, poor feeding practices in the first two years of life contribute to two-thirds of malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed during the first six months, leading to increased risk of disease. Introducing inadequate and unsafe foods early or late can also harm infants. Studies show that exclusively breastfed infants have fewer childhood diseases and lower mortality rates from respiratory infections. USAID emphasizes the importance of proper infant feeding practices, stating that introducing nutritionally inadequate and unsafe foods can harm infants. A study supported by USAID found that exclusively breastfed infants have significantly lower rates of childhood diseases and mortality from respiratory infections. Additionally, USAID works to integrate safe infant feeding practices in communities affected by HIV/AIDS. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices in communities affected by HIV/AIDS, spending $30 million annually on nutrition programs including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF recommends minimizing indoor pollution, ensuring adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia in children. Full immunizations are also crucial in preventing pneumonia. To prevent pneumonia in children, it is important to minimize indoor pollution, ensure adequate nourishment, exclusively breastfeed, provide Vitamin A and zinc supplements, and administer full immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis. International health organizations aim to increase access to vaccines protecting against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of severe pneumonia in developing countries. USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treatment for over 375 million since 2002. Since 2002, USAID has supported immunizations for almost 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. USAID has expanded the IMCI strategy to address diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and malaria in the world's poorest countries. About 40% of the global population, mostly in developing nations, are at risk of malaria annually. The IMCI strategy integrates interventions for diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and malaria. USAID has expanded the strategy to address malaria, which affects approximately 40% of the world's population, with most cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is particularly deadly for children, with at least 1 million infants and children under age five in sub-Saharan Africa dying each year. USAID has been engaged in malaria eradication efforts. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) aims to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) aims to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control. PMI increased international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 to FY2010 in 15 countries, reaching more than 25 million people within two years. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. In its efforts to combat malaria, PMI distributed over 1.1 million insecticide-treated nets, procured 12.6 million malarial treatments, trained 28,000 health workers, and purchased 4 million anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable. Transmission from HIV-infected mothers to children can be reduced to 2% with successful interventions. The risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission can be reduced to 2% with successful interventions. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is commonly used. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy for children are critical according to WHO. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with an annual supply of generic ARTs costing about $260 per child compared to $183 for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. WHO emphasizes early diagnosis and treatment for children due to the faster and more aggressive course of HIV infection in this population. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with an annual supply of generic ARTs costing about $260 per child compared to $183 for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Health experts emphasize that ART is not the only treatment to reduce child mortality in HIV-positive children. Cotrimoxazole, a drug for pneumonia, can also improve child survival, reducing mortality by 30% at a cost of $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children needing the drug are receiving it. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by about 30% at a cost of $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children who need the drug are receiving it. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries since 1986. Since the inception of PEPFAR, USAID stopped reporting project outcomes, with all participating agency outcomes reported as PEPFAR advancements. Through September 2007, PEPFAR implementing agencies have provided over $289.2 million to initiatives. PEPFAR, through its implementing agencies and departments, has provided over $289.2 million to initiatives that offer care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs support training for caregivers, promote technology use, and connect children to income-generating activities. PEPFAR's child-focus programs support training for caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children, promote technology use, and connect families to essential health care and social services. Support for people living with HIV/AIDS who receive treatment should also be considered, as it helps create a nurturing environment for children. Through September 2007, PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for these initiatives. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for programs offering care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS. In FY2006 and FY2007, nearly $191.5 million was dedicated to pediatric treatment for 85,900 children. PMTCT services were provided to over 10 million pregnancies, including ART for HIV-positive women in over 827,000 pregnancies. Since FY2004, PEPFAR-implementing agencies have supported PMTCT services for over 10 million pregnancies, providing ART to HIV-positive women in 827,000 pregnancies and preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. Research by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID found that diarrhea can be prevented and treated with ORS, fluids, breastfeeding, continued feeding, and selective antibiotics and zinc supplementation. USAID has provided over $1.5 billion since 2002 for treating child diarrhea with ORS, totaling almost 5 billion episodes. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for treating child diarrhea with ORS, preventing and treating diarrhea through various methods such as fluids, breastfeeding, antibiotics, and zinc supplementation. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on hygiene, with handwashing with soap estimated to decrease diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. USAID focuses on expanding community capacity to administer ORS and emphasizes hygiene to reduce diarrhea transmission. Handwashing with soap can decrease diarrhea prevalence by 42% to 46%, but it is not common in poorer communities. Studies show low rates of soap use for handwashing in Burkina Faso and Lucknow, India. In Burkina Faso and Lucknow, India, low rates of soap use for handwashing were observed. USAID supports partnerships promoting handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. Measles immunization is cost-effective in preventing childhood deaths. The measles vaccine is a cost-effective public health intervention that can prevent childhood deaths. It costs less than $1 per dose and has been available for over 40 years. In countries where rubella and mumps are significant public health concerns, the measles vaccine is often combined with rubella. The measles vaccine, available for over 40 years, costs about $0.33 per dose through UNICEF. In countries with high burden of rubella and mumps, it is often combined with rubella or mumps vaccines as a combined MR or MMR vaccine. Immunization coverage rates vary by region, with about 80% of children vaccinated in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. The cost of a MR vaccine is around $0.65 per dose, while MMR costs between $1.04 to $1.50 per dose. Measles vaccination coverage rates varied by region, with an estimated 80% of children vaccinated in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2006, 478 million children aged nine months to 14 years received measles vaccinations in 46 out of 47 priority countries, resulting in a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. Between 2000 and 2006, global measles mortality decreased by 68%, with the largest gains in Africa where cases and deaths fell by 91%. USAID supports immunization programs in over 100 countries, training health workers and improving service delivery. USAID-supported immunization programs in over 100 countries train health workers, strengthen planning capacity, and improve vaccine administration. USAID partners with organizations like GAVI, the Vaccine Fund, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to enhance countries' vaccine administration capacity. Maternal health programs aim to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions. Maternal health programs in low-resource environments include interventions such as nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, tetanus toxoid immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries to reduce infant mortality. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent infant deaths by facilitating infant breathing, resuscitating, and providing hygienic care. Community-based maternal health interventions include teaching families to recognize birth complications, arranging transportation to a hospital, identifying blood donors, and creating savings plans. Community-based maternal health interventions focus on recognizing birth complications, arranging transportation to a hospital, identifying blood donors, and creating savings plans. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality, such as postpartum hemorrhage, which accounts for 32% of maternal deaths. Low-cost interventions can prevent and treat this condition, emphasizing the importance of skilled birth attendants administering necessary drugs during childbirth. To prevent postpartum hemorrhage deaths, USAID urges communities to ensure mothers give birth with a trained health care practitioner who can administer drugs and apply life-saving techniques. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to manage labor's third stage, preventing 60% of hemorrhages. USAID reports that actively managing the third stage of labor can prevent 60% of hemorrhages. Sepsis or infections cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, with unhygienic delivery practices identified as a key cause. Practices such as introducing unclean hands, herbs, or cloths inside the vagina contribute to sepsis. Unhygienic delivery practices, like using unclean hands and instruments during delivery, contribute to sepsis. USAID supports distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to prevent infections. Hypertensive disorders account for 9% of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent sepsis during childbirth and educates them on identifying and treating infections. They also provide training on recognizing and managing hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Additionally, USAID helps healthcare providers address prolonged or obstructed labor to ensure safe deliveries. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby, including the risk of death or lifelong disabilities. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence in low-resource settings. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence of prolonged or obstructed labor in low-resource settings, especially among young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases were found to be among adolescents. Prevention includes delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when necessary. USAID has supported fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. These programs aim to increase access to emergency obstetrical care, encourage the postponement of child marriage and sexual debut, and provide training to families and community health. Key activities in maternal health programs include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, postponing child marriage and sexual debut, training families and community health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Unsafe abortion procedures contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, totaling 67,000 deaths annually, with regional variations. Unsafe abortion procedures contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, totaling 67,000 deaths annually. Regional variations exist, with Latin America and the Caribbean accounting for 12% of maternal deaths on average, and Africa seeing about 4% of women dying after attempting unsafe abortions. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs grew by about 8% from FY2001 to FY2003, with overall support for global health programs also increasing. USAID's CS/MH programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. From FY2001 to FY2003, appropriations to USAID's global health programs grew by about 28%, with significant increases in funding for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS programs received support for the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, while funds for tuberculosis and malaria programs were also increased. During FY2004 through FY2008, higher appropriations were allocated for HIV/AIDS programs, reflecting support for the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. The majority of OID funds were directed towards tuberculosis and malaria programs, with increased support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. U.S. contributions to global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs began to dominate discussions about USAID's health programs during this period. U.S. contributions to global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs were a focus from FY2004 through FY2008. While some Members praised the focus on HIV/AIDS, questions were raised about the allocation of funds for other global health interventions like child survival and maternal health. Concerns were also raised about recipient countries' ability to handle the increasing HIV/AIDS funds due to strained health infrastructures. During FY2004 through FY2008, Congress provided $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, far surpassing support for USAID's other health programs. Concerns were raised about recipient countries' capacity to absorb the increasing HIV/AIDS funds due to strained health infrastructures. Congress urged better integration of HIV/AIDS with TB and nutrition programs. During FY2004 through FY2008, Congress allocated $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, surpassing support for other health initiatives. Congress consistently increased funding for USAID's global health programs, mainly targeting specific diseases. USAID's global health programs under President George W. Bush focused on specific diseases. Congress supported higher spending on targeted U.S. programs through initiatives like PEPFAR and the President's Malaria Initiative. Funding for other health issues remained relatively unchanged, except for a slight increase in FY2008. Appropriations for global health programs have increased, particularly for countering diseases like HIV/AIDS, while funding for other health issues, such as child survival and maternal health, has remained relatively unchanged. Concerns have been raised about the underfunding of life-saving interventions for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization states that many child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are preventable with low-cost interventions. Concerns have been raised about the lack of funding for health issues affecting child survival and maternal health. Some suggest increasing funding for family planning to improve maternal and child health. Some urge Congress to boost support for health issues affecting child survival and maternal health, including voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health. Family planning activities protect women's health by reducing high-risk pregnancies and children's health by spacing pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and stabilizing population growth. Opposition to funding family planning includes concerns about abortions and coercive practices in some programs. Family planning can improve maternal and child health by reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, and stabilizing population growth. Some oppose funding family planning due to concerns about abortions and coercive practices in programs. Research shows that adolescent girls in rural areas of developing countries are at higher risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery. Research indicates that teenage mothers are at higher risk of delivering low-birthweight babies and experiencing pregnancy complications such as toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, prolonged labor, and cervical trauma. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 being five times as likely to die. Adolescent girls are also more prone to developing obstetric fistula, with a study in Kenya finding that 45% of fistula cases were among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean can help prevent obstetric fistula. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases are among adolescents. Preventing obstetric fistula involves delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean surgery when needed. Repairing the condition costs about $300, which is prohibitive for many young girls and women in affected countries. Increasing spending on health systems is advocated to reduce maternal and child mortality effectively. Increasing spending on health systems is advocated to significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by ensuring access to essential interventions and services such as vaccinations, prenatal care, safe drinking water, and basic sanitation. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of donor support for health systems in delivering these interventions effectively. Improvements in health systems and availability of health workers are crucial for delivering essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality nationwide. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to better coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries for improved efficiency and outcomes. WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+) are cited as successful models for collaboration. The International Health Partnership (IHP+) encourages donors to create compacts with countries to support national health plans for long-term financing from both national and international sources. The International Health Partnership (IHP+) encourages countries to commit to a results-oriented national health plan with long-term financing from national and international sources through compacts. Compacts are contracts that bind donors and government agencies to one health plan, monitoring and evaluation plan, budget harmonization, reporting process, and benchmarks for government performance. Global health experts emphasize the importance of recipient governments in improving health systems. Critics argue that donors need to consider the role of political will in low health spending in developing countries. According to the IMF, 29% of health practitioners attribute unspent health funds to a lack of political will, while only 1% blame restrictions from the IMF or World Bank. According to the IMF, 29% of health practitioners attribute unspent health funds to a lack of political will in developing countries. Developing countries with severe health worker shortages spend about $33 per person on health annually, while the U.S. government spends $2,548 per capita. Africa spends less than 1% of the world's health expenditure, but African leaders have pledged to increase health spending. Members of the African Union have committed to this goal. The U.S. government spends $2,548 per capita on health annually. Africa spends less than 1% of the world's health expenditure, but African leaders have pledged to increase spending. Members of the African Union signed the Abuja Declaration to allocate at least 15% of their national budgets to healthcare. According to the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Plans of Action of the Abuja Declarations, 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to health by 2004. Only Botswana spent at least 15% on health. Some argue that poor political will is not the main reason for low health spending in Africa. Some African governments struggle to increase health budgets due to structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices, leading to shortages in health supplies, equipment, medicine, and vaccines, as well as a brain drain in the healthcare sector. Shrunken health budgets have caused a decline in education and training for medical students, shortages of health supplies and equipment, insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and a brain drain of African health workers. Discussions on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health are often biased, with mixed results according to the International Development Research Center. The International Development Research Center found that discussions on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health are often biased. Results were mixed, and the organization could not support either extreme viewpoint. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health. H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, increased support for maternal and child health. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized $50 billion and $48 billion for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions. The Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorizes $50 billion for international HIV/AIDS interventions and $48 billion for TB and malaria interventions. It requires women receiving drugs to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission to also receive maternal and child services. The House version emphasizes linkages to NGOs for multi-sectoral approaches in HIV/AIDS education and testing, while the Senate version does not mention family planning. The Senate version of the bill passed H.R. 5501 by voice vote, 80-16, with a substitute amendment that included language from S. 2731. H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, Global Poverty Act of 2007, require the President to develop a strategy to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goal. The Global Poverty Act of 2007, H.R. 2266 and S. 1418, aim to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goal by improving maternal and child health. The House passed the bill on September 25, 2007, and the Senate version was placed on the Senate calendar on April 24, 2007. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to improve maternal and child health in developing countries. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to improve maternal and child health in developing countries. The bills focus on family planning programs, repairing young women's lives, and providing contributions to the United Nations Population Fund for obstetric fistula prevention and treatment. H.R. 2114 and H.R. 2604 focus on providing support to the United Nations Population Fund for women's health and family planning in developing countries. The bill aims to save women's lives, reduce unsafe abortions, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries. It was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Another bill, S. 1998, focuses on reducing child marriage. S. 2682 directs funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health purposes. The bill S. 2682 directs U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health purposes. H.Res. 1045 calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation. Resolution H.Res. 1045 aims to reduce nuclear weapons, prevent proliferation, and allocate savings towards child survival, hunger, and education. It also calls on the President to take action towards these goals. Resolution H.Res. 1022 affirms the House's commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment and participation, recognizing their importance to families, societies, and global development. The House agreed to the resolution, as amended, but the motion to reconsider was agreed to without objection."
