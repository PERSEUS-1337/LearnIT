    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Congress rejected proposals to terminate the program in previous budgets and provided funding to continue it. In FY2011, Congress eliminated funding for the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter, leading to General Electric and Rolls-Royce ending development of the F136 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine for the F-35 fighter, following the Department of Defense's selection of the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. The F136 engine was initially developed as an alternate engine for the F-35 program. The F136 engine, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce as an alternate engine for the F-35 program, was based on an engine created for the unsuccessful McDonnell Douglas JSF candidate. Despite the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program in FY2007, Congress restored funding and directed DOD to continue the program in future years. The F136 engine, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce as an alternate engine for the F-35 program, faced proposed terminations in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010, which were rejected by Congress. However, funding for the program was deleted in FY2011, leading to the formal termination of the alternate engine program by DOD on April 25, 2011. Supporters of the Administration's proposal argued that developing and procuring a second engine for the F-35 would significantly increase costs. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated on April 25, 2011. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would greatly increase costs, potentially reducing the number of F-35s that could be procured and forcing cuts in future capabilities and force structure. An official from the F-35 program office estimated that the reduction in F-35 procurement over the next five years could be significant. The F-35 program office stated that reducing F-35 procurement over the next five years could total 50 to 80 aircraft. Procuring a second engine would increase life-cycle operation and support costs. Supporting two engines on aircraft carriers would be challenging due to limited space. International interest in the F-35 is sustained without the need for a second engine. Having a second engine for carriers is challenging due to limited space. International interest in the F-35 does not require a second engine, as potential buyers are already committed to the program. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets. The F-35 program does not require a second engine due to limited space on carriers. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. The development of the F135 engine has progressed to a point where an alternate engine program is no longer necessary to hedge against technical problems. The development, testing, and production of the F135 engine for the F-35 have advanced to a stage where an alternate engine program is no longer needed to mitigate technical issues. Fixes for previous test failures have been identified and are being implemented. Opponents argue that terminating the alternate engine program goes against a specific section of the FY2008 defense authorization act. The Administration's proposal to end the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter does not align with Section 213 of the FY2008 defense authorization act, which mandates the development and procurement of two propulsion system options for the F-35. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for two propulsion system options for the Joint Strike Fighter to avoid reliance on a single engine type. This is crucial as F-35s will be the main strike fighters, and having a backup engine would prevent grounding the entire fleet in case of issues. Having a second engine for the F-35 fighter jets would prevent grounding the entire fleet in case of engine issues, promote competition, reduce costs, and improve performance and reliability. Having a second engine for the F-35 fighter jets would prevent grounding the entire fleet in case of engine issues, promote competition, reduce costs, and improve performance and reliability. Additionally, competition would lead to better engine performance, increased reliability, and improved contractor responsiveness. Two F-35 engine production lines would allow for quicker production surges and maintain effective competition in future tactical aircraft engine development. Having a second engine for the F-35 fighter jets would maintain competition, prevent fleet grounding, reduce costs, and improve performance. International interest in the F-35 program would be sustained, maximizing exports. Potential foreign buyers would prefer having a choice in the aircraft's engine, believing competition would keep costs down. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with all tooling and engines ordered to be returned. Over $200 million in F136 hardware is spread across 17 facilities. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of their self-funded program on December 2, 2011. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD in April 2011. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program. The F-35 program received a total of $7.3 billion in funding during FY1994-FY2009, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The estimated cost of the F135 SDD contract increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009, with $0.8 billion attributed to cost growth and $1.1 billion to an expanded scope of work. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received a total of $2.4 billion during the period FY1995-FY2009, including $1.7 billion for SDD work for the F136 engine. The F136 SDD contract did not include design, development, test, or delivery of STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract did not cover design, development, test, or delivery of STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The government operated under continuing resolutions until the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act was enacted on April 15, 2011. Some members of Congress questioned the status due to the Administration's opposition to further funding of the alternate engine program. Before the FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act was enacted on April 15, 2011, the government operated under continuing resolutions. Some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program during this period. CRs prohibited spending on new starts or on procurement rates above FY2010 levels. The CR effective through March 4, 2011, set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. The CR effective through March 4, 2011, set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis during this period. Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would fund activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR ending March 4, 2011. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates mentioned Congress adding $1.8 billion to the program, estimating an additional $2.9 billion cost over five years. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that Congress added $1.8 billion to the program, estimating an additional $2.9 billion cost over the next five years. He mentioned that there is little advantage to taxpayers in having a second engine, as most customers will only buy one engine due to limited logistics and space available. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, and there are concerns about it facing similar development issues as the first engine. The Air Force is the only part of the program that could be competed, as the Marine Corps and Navy will only take one airplane each due to limited logistics and space on ships. European partners are likely to buy European or Rolls-Royce GE engines. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has completed 50 hours of testing, and there are concerns about it facing similar development issues. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine due to logistical and cost implications. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about investing in a second engine due to logistical and cost implications, citing technological advancements in engine design. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified that the F-35 should not have an alternate engine due to advancements in engine technology and the potential impact on the number of F-35s produced. He also mentioned the reliability of single-engine aircraft like the F-22 and F-18E/F. General Schwartz and Admiral Roughead expressed their support for single-engine aircraft like the F-35, questioning the need for an alternate engine due to advancements in engine technology. Schwartz criticized Rolls and GE for expecting taxpayers to fund the alternate engine without investing more themselves. Roughead emphasized the importance of space on carriers, supporting the use of a single engine. General Schwartz and Admiral Roughead support single-engine aircraft like the F-35, questioning the need for an alternate engine. Schwartz criticized Rolls and GE for expecting taxpayer funding without investing more. Roughead emphasized carrier space importance, backing a single engine. Marine Corps Gen. Cartwright highlighted the cost comparison, suggesting investing in more Predators instead of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The discussion revolves around the need for an alternate engine for high-demand aerial systems in Afghanistan. The decision to invest in a second engine involves upfront costs for development, tooling, and infrastructure, with the question of whether the investment will be repaid in lower costs. The need for a second engine for high-demand aerial systems in Afghanistan involves upfront costs for development and infrastructure. The question is whether the investment will be repaid in lower prices induced by competition between the two engine variants. The Administration believed the alternative engine program was no longer necessary as a hedge against the main Joint Strike Fighter engine program's failure, with small financial benefits from competition. The Administration stated that the alternative engine program was no longer needed as a hedge against the main Joint Strike Fighter engine program's failure, citing small financial benefits from competition. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars from the cancellation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that competitive pressures could offset the costs of competition over the JSF program's life. The GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield savings to offset the costs of competition over the JSF program's life, with potential near-term savings of over a billion dollars. They also mentioned that continuing the JSF alternate engine program may require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, but a competitive strategy could result in savings equal to or exceeding that amount. The GAO stated that a competitive strategy for the JSF program could yield savings to offset costs, potentially saving over a billion dollars. They also mentioned that continuing the alternate engine program may require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s resulted in significant savings across the engine's life cycle. The GAO reported potential savings of roughly 16 percent for operations and support costs, and a total of about 21 percent in overall life cycle costs. Nonfinancial benefits of competition include better performance and increased reliability. Cost growth in the F135 engine has led to debate over the need for a competitor to control costs. Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 in July 2009. The cost growth in the F135 engine has sparked a debate over the need for a competitor to control costs. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135, from $6.7 million to $8.3 million apiece. Secretary Gates mentioned that cost growth is expected with developmental aircraft and allocated over $4 billion in the FY '10 budget to address program risks. Fixing the encountered problems with the engine is deemed manageable. In July 2009, DOD created a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues for the F135 engine. The team aims to help the JSF office assess the company's latest bid and understand production costs. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was created by DOD to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues for the F135 engine. The team's charter includes understanding production costs, cost drivers, and developing a plan to address F135 cost and affordability. DOD has not provided CRS access to the JAT results. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. Defense Department officials believe this supports their decision. A Pentagon study showed that adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan, supporting the Defense Department's decision. The estimated costs of a competitive engine acquisition strategy are projected to be equivalent to a sole-source scenario, according to a memo sent to lawmakers. The Pentagon memo explains that developing a second engine for the F-35 would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan. Despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine, the overall cost savings do not justify having two competing F-35 engine programs. Christine Fox, from the Defense Department, stated that savings from two F-35 engine programs do not justify having them compete. Pratt & Whitney allocated $1 billion for additional engines and support for flight testing and production improvements for the F-35. About $400 million would go towards engine improvements, with a third focused on parts specific to the F-35B. The Defense Department allocated funds for F-35 engine improvements, with $400 million specifically for parts related to the F-35B. Two-thirds of the improvements aim to exceed the original specifications for increased robustness. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were directed by Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were conducted in 2007, with differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were highlighted, including improvements in fleet readiness and contractor responsiveness. In 2007, studies had varying conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were noted, such as improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of industrial base, and stronger international relations. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The study assumed that the second F-35 engine provider would meet the initial provider in pricing in 2014, the first year of competition. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. It assumed that the second F-35 engine provider would match the initial provider in pricing in 2014. The study estimated a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the lifetime of the program for a break-even point. The CAIG study estimated that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs would be needed for an F-35 engine competition to break even. On a net-present-value basis, the required reduction for break-even would be 25.6%. DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to potentially recoup its investment in the alternate engine development program. The CAIG study estimated that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040 to recoup its investment in the alternate engine development program. The study also highlighted the growth potential in the F-35 engine, projecting a 7.2% weight growth for fourth- or fifth-generation fighters. The CAIG study discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating a 7.2% weight growth for fourth- or fifth-generation fighters between Critical Design Review (CDR) and Initial Operational Capability (IOC), with additional weight growth thereafter. Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was close to exceeding its designed temperature specifications, requiring modifications for increased engine thrust. The CAIG study highlighted the need for engine thrust growth in the F-35 program, with Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine nearing its temperature limits. The IDA study analyzed engine competitions for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating potential savings of 11% to 18% in an F-35 engine competition. Past studies showed an average savings of 14.6% in procurement competitions. The IDA study estimated that an F-35 engine competition could result in a gross savings of 11% to 18%. It also concluded that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur investment costs of $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars, making it unfeasible to recoup these costs through procurement-cost savings alone. The study determined that a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even on an NPV basis. The study found that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would not be able to recoup its $8.8 billion investment costs through procurement-cost savings alone. It stated that a 40% savings would be needed for the program to break even on an NPV basis, and this amount would decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. The study highlighted the lack of historical data linking procurement and O&S costs in a single competition, leading to limited estimates of potential O&S savings. The IDA and GAO studies highlighted the importance of contractor responsiveness in the Great Engine War for the F-35 program. The F-35 is expected to make up 95% of the US fighter/strike-fighter force by 2035, and having an alternate engine could prevent the entire fleet from being grounded due to engine issues. Enhanced industry responsiveness from competitive forces could improve fleet readiness. The GAO study suggested that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be necessary for the alternate engine program. The GAO study indicated that industry responsiveness to engine upgrades due to competition could significantly impact fleet readiness. It stated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even. Past engine competitions have shown up to 20% financial savings, suggesting that competing the engine could recoup investment costs. Michael Sullivan from GAO believed the alternate engine program would be successful. The study found that past engine competitions have shown up to 20% financial savings, indicating that competing the engine could recoup investment costs. Michael Sullivan, GAO's director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management, believed the alternate engine program would reach its break-even point by the late 2020s. The DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the alternate engine program for its non-financial benefits, despite only marginal financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. The size of the F-35 production run can influence the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on F-35 procurement and engine choices play a significant role in determining the production run size. The size of the F-35 production run is influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement and engine choices. Decisions can change over time due to international security environment and defense budgets, making it hard to predict the final production size. In 2009, the GE/Rolls-Royce team offered to build F136 engines at a fixed price after initial lots, followed by a similar offer from Pratt & Whitney. The ultimate size of the F-35 production run and engine contracts are uncertain. GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney made fixed-price offers for F136 and F135 engines after initial lots. Pratt & Whitney and DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135 engines in December 2010. A fixed-price offer for F135 engines was declined by DOD, but GE/Rolls-Royce made a second offer covering FY2012-FY2014. Pratt & Whitney and DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s for F-35s in LRIP IV, with costs 16% lower than LRIP III. A MOU signed in 2006 outlines the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2006 outlines the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF Air System, including the production of the JSF Air Vehicle and propulsion systems. The Air Force confirmed that the MOU scope of work remains unchanged. The Air Force confirmed that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2006 for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) includes the development of primary and alternate propulsion systems. The MOU provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 propulsion systems remains valid, contingent on the availability of funds from the U.S. and partner nations. The PSFD MOU provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, subject to availability of funds from the U.S. and partner nations. The Department will continue to implement its obligations under the JSF SDD and PSFD MOU. Consultations have been held with partners regarding the decision not to include F136 in RDT&E funding requests. There are no plans to amend the MOUs regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. Other European countries, like the Netherlands, have firms involved in F135 production. The Department will not include F136 in its RDT&E funding requests. The JSF SDD MOU and PSFD MOU will not be amended regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. European countries with firms involved in F135 production may change their stance on the second engine based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supports the F136. On September 3, 2010, British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox wrote to Senator Carl Levin in support of the F136 engine for the JSF program, expressing concerns about the long-term costs of canceling the second engine. Both JSF engines have faced development challenges, with the F135 engine experiencing failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008. The F135 engine for the JSF program experienced failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to \"high-cycle fatigue\" leading to turbine blade failure. These malfunctions caused delays in the first flight of the F-35B aircraft. The F135 engine failures in 2008 delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two and contributed to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million. A test on September 11, 2009, resulted in damage to an F135 engine due to a worn bushing, leading to damage to fan blades. Pratt & Whitney stated that the damage occurred in a second-generation engine, not the version on current flight-test aircraft, and a \"minor modification\" would be made to all initial engines. The F136 engine encountered three test incidents, including damage to fan blades due to a worn bushing and impact damage on turbine blades caused by a loose nut. A minor modification will be made to all initial service release production engines with little impact on cost and schedule. On October 2, 2009, an F136 engine ingested a test sensor, causing minor damage. A loose nut led to impact damage on turbine blades, prompting a redesign for better security. In September 2010, another F136 engine sustained damage to its fan and compressor, resulting in a design change to prevent recurrence. In April 2011, some F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue identified during testing. In April 2011, some F135 engines were replaced with spares after a misassembly issue was identified during testing at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. Pratt & Whitney confirmed that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines were replaced with spares due to the same problem found in other engines. In March, F135 engines were replaced with spares due to a mis-assembly issue found during testing. Pratt & Whitney ordered replacements after identifying quality control deficiencies leading to increased costs. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney for the high scrap and rework rate, calling for improved manufacturing processes. Pratt & Whitney responded to criticism about high scrap and rework rates, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate. William Begert, the vice president of business development, mentioned that for a couple of parts, they were at a 70 to 80 percent yield rate, which was considered acceptable at that stage of the program. Overall, the company was running at a 97 percent scrap rate for the total engine. William Begert, VP of business development, stated that Pratt & Whitney is currently at an 80 percent yield rate, with a 97 percent scrap rate for the total engine. A General Electric F136 achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135 in January 2011 amidst discussions on terminating the alternate engine program in the FY2012 budget. Pratt & Whitney plans to start tests of a higher-thrust F135 in January 2011. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue the program or accept termination. Congressional appropriations have supported the program using funds from various sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. The alternate engine program for the F-35 has drawn funds from various sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional DOD topline funds. The allocation of funds may impact other DOD programs, potentially leading to cuts in F-35 activities if funds are taken from existing budget lines. The F-35 program may have to cut activities to fund the alternate engine program, potentially reducing the number of aircraft produced. Increasing funding for the alternate engine without increasing the overall DOD budget could lead to funds being taken from other defense programs. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program at the expense of other defense priorities. Increased funding for the alternate engine program for the F-35 could result in funds being diverted from other defense programs. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program, potentially impacting the number of F-35s produced or other defense capabilities. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine due to congressionally directed appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years was needed to develop the F136 engine for competition, according to a 2010 report by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office report in September 2010 stated that the $2.9 billion figure for developing the F136 engine \"does not include the same level of fidelity and precision normally associated with a detailed, comprehensive estimate.\" Different assumptions and more detailed information could either increase or decrease the funding projection accordingly. Supporter of the F136 engine refer to a GAO study showing that the up-front cost of development may be significant. Supporters of the F136 engine argue that the up-front cost of developing it may be offset by savings from competition over the program's lifetime. Congress must decide which assumptions to believe regarding the impact of competition on cost. Competition is seen as a way to control cost growth in either competitor's product. The effects of competition on cost are crucial in these analyses. Competition is viewed as a check on cost growth in either competitor's product. Without competition, contracts are negotiated based on past experience to set prices, with incentives for meeting cost targets and penalties for missing them. Congress must weigh the fleet-grounding risk of a single engine type for the F-35 against accepted risks with other aircraft fleets. The debate over the procurement of a second engine for the F-35 centers around the risk of fleet-grounding due to a single engine type. Supporters argue that having only one engine type poses a higher risk of all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues, citing past incidents like the Marine Corps grounding 106 AV-8B Harriers in 2000. Congress must consider whether this risk justifies the additional cost of a second engine. The debate over the F-35's second engine focuses on the risk of fleet-grounding with a single engine type. Past incidents, like the Marine Corps grounding 106 AV-8B Harriers in 2000 due to engine issues, highlight this risk. The Air Force and Navy have also experienced groundings related to engine problems. Terminating the F136 alternate engine program is argued to pose minimal operational risk by DOD officials. The F136 alternate engine program is considered to have low operational risk according to DOD officials. Advances in technology such as computational fluid design and advanced software for health monitoring reduce the risks of relying on a single engine type for aircraft. The software can diagnose engine conditions and alert pilots of potential failures. The advanced software for prognostic health monitoring reduces operational risks by diagnosing engine conditions and providing early warnings of potential failures, allowing pilots to land before a failure occurs. However, supporting multiple engines may pose operational and logistical challenges, especially for organizations with limited facilities like the Navy. The Navy faces challenges in supporting multiple engines due to limited facilities. Admiral Gary Roughead and Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz express concerns about the use of alternate engines. Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz expressed concerns about the use of alternate engines for the Air Force, stating that the Navy and European partners are unlikely to operate them. Despite this, the Air Force has experience supporting multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets with the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 buy. The Air Force has experience supporting multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets with the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 buy. The potential issue for policy makers is the effect of terminating the F136 engine on General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines. The engine debate boils down to whether the Pentagon should pay GE up to $3 billion to compete with Pratt. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines is a key concern, with the debate focusing on whether the Pentagon should fund GE to compete with Pratt. GE holds a significant market share in commercial aircraft engines and supports various military engine series. Studies have highlighted GE's strong position in the commercial engine market. General Electric produces F400 series engines for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as supports the F110 series for both domestic and international clients. A 2007 study noted GE's strong position in the commercial engine market, producing 1,000 engines compared to Pratt & Whitney's 220. GE derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50%. The debate revolves around GE's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines. The CAIG study highlighted General Electric's reliance on military engines, with Pratt & Whitney deriving a larger portion of its business from military engines. Concerns were raised about GE's ability to compete for future military engine contracts if the F136 program was terminated, as some engineers may not be able to transfer their skills to commercial engines. The CAIG study of 2007 found that ending the F136 engine program could hinder General Electric's ability to compete for military engine contracts. It may also reduce the number of suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between F135 and F136 could create uncertainty for suppliers. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines for F-35 production could reduce workload for F135 suppliers and create uncertainty for both F135 and F136 suppliers. Multiple vendors creating parts for each engine could help mitigate disruptions in the spare parts supply chain. An IDA study in 2007 suggested that suppliers are unlikely to exit the domestic industrial base due to F136 termination. The 2007 IDA study examined F136 component suppliers and concluded that multiple vendors could create parts for each engine, reducing disruptions in the spare parts supply chain. While the study suggested that suppliers are unlikely to exit the domestic industrial base if the F136 engine is terminated, it expressed concerns about DOD relying solely on a firm with a weak position in the commercial marketplace for fighter engine production. The 2007 IDA study found that multiple vendors could supply parts for the F136 engine, reducing spare parts supply chain disruptions. Concerns were raised about DOD placing fighter engine production with a firm weak in the commercial marketplace, as it could limit resources for DOD products.

The House report highlights the development of the competitive F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. This initiative has been consistently supported in committee reports accompanying previous defense authorization acts. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system in various defense authorization acts, with support from other congressional defense committees. Despite a requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the Secretary of Defense must allocate sufficient annual amounts. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, but the Department of Defense has not included funds for this purpose in the budget request for the third consecutive year. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth. The Department of Defense has chosen not to include funds for the F-35 competitive propulsion system in the budget request for the third consecutive year. The F135 engine development program has seen a cost increase of $1.872 billion since its inception in 2002. The F-35 program manager reported a cost increase of $1.872 billion in development costs by the end of 2008, representing a 38% increase. Engine procurement costs for the F-35 variants also saw significant increases between 2005 and 2008, ranging from 38 to 47 percent. Between December 2005 and December 2008, engine procurement cost estimates for the F-35B variant increased by approximately 47%. The cost growth is attributed to both the F135 engine and the F-35B's lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program did not experience any cost growth. The F136 pre-EMD contract, initiated in 2002 and completed in 2004 for $411.0 million, remained stable without cost growth. The F136 EMD contract, awarded in 2005 for $2.486 billion, has also maintained a stable cost estimate since contract award. The committee is puzzled by the cost increases in F135 development and procurement. The F136 engine program, completed in 2004 for $411.0 million, did not experience cost growth.

Additionally, $140.0 million is recommended for the procurement of four F136 engines and related components. The report recommends an increase in funding for the F-35 propulsion system program due to cost growth, test failures, and schedule delays. It also suggests procurement of four F136 engines and related components, despite objections from the Administration regarding the alternative engine program. The Administration objects to the addition of $603 million for the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), citing the current engine's performance and unnecessary expenditures on a second engine. This will delay the JSF capability and capacity, impacting the Department's strike fighter inventory. The Administration opposes the bill mandating an alternative engine program for the JSF, citing the current engine's successful performance with over 11,000 test hours. They argue that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and could hinder the overall JSF program progress. The alleged risks of fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated, as the Air Force operates several fleets with single-engine sources. Additionally, the Administration objects to limiting the obligation of JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated in FY 2010. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's senior officials will intervene. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends allocating 75% of JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated.

They believe that continuing certain efforts could yield significant payback. The F-35 program is crucial for the future of tactical aviation, with plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft. The Air Force plans to procure over 2,500 fifth-generation stealthy F-35 aircraft and will fly them well into the future. The original plan for the F-35 propulsion engine included two variants, but cost growth led to the abandonment of the alternate engine program. Currently, all three F-35 variants will be powered by the same engine, which may simplify logistics but could pose problems in the future. The Committee is concerned that any technical issues with the engine could potentially ground a significant portion of the Nation's tactical aircraft inventory. The Committee is concerned about potential technical problems with the F-35 engine, which could ground the entire fleet of aircraft and limit the Commander-in-Chief's flexibility during a crisis. They also highlight the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could result in missed cost-saving opportunities. The Committee is concerned about the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could lead to missed cost-saving opportunities. They question the Department's business case analysis comparing a sole source provider to a dual source strategy, especially considering the significant investment made by Congress in an alternate engine program. The Committee recommends additional funding of $430,000,000 for the continued development of the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program, citing cost-effectiveness and the need for a dual source strategy. The Committee recommends $560,000,000 for the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, emphasizing the cost-effective dual source strategy for engine acquisition. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the program in future budget requests. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Administration strongly objects to additional funding for the JSF alternate engine, stating it is unnecessary and diverts resources from the overall program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the F-35 alternate engine development, citing it as unnecessary and diverting resources from the overall program. The current engine is performing well, and the risks of having a single engine provider are manageable. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the F-35 alternate engine development, deeming it unnecessary and a diversion of resources. The House Armed Services Committee included $485 million for the alternate engine in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act, with a provision limiting DOD's F-35 budget spending until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included language to limit DOD's F-35 budget spending until all funds for the alternate engine development are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits spending on the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. Additionally, DOD must acquire certification before procuring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act imposes limits on spending for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for an alternate engine are obligated. Certification is required before the procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act imposes limits on spending for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for an alternate engine are obligated. Certification is required before the procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft, with specific requirements for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to certify the advance procurement funds for F136 engines. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act imposes limits on spending for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for an alternate engine are obligated. Certification is required before the procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft, with specific requirements for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to certify the advance procurement funds for F136 engines. The Under Secretary must ensure that advance procurement funds for F136 engines have been obligated, six engines are available for testing, and at least 1,000 test hours have been completed in the F136 system development and demonstration program. H.R. 5136 requires funds for F136 engine development and testing, with specific criteria to be met before procurement of F-35 aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must include alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission. The Secretary of Defense must request funds for the continued development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual defense budget materials. The Secretary of Defense must request funds for the full funding of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the defense budget materials and future-years defense program. The Secretary of Defense must request funds for the full funding of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the defense budget materials and future-years defense program. For each fiscal year, there should be sufficient amounts allocated for the continued development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must ensure sufficient annual funding for the development and procurement of two propulsion system options for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft to support competitive production. The term 'budget' refers to the budget for a fiscal year submitted to Congress by the President, while 'defense budget materials' are materials submitted by the Secretary of Defense in support of the budget. H.R. 5136 designates budgeting for a competitive propulsion system for F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is repealed. The budget for a competitive propulsion system for F-35 Lightning II aircraft is designated as a major subprogram with more oversight and reporting requirements. Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is repealed. The Secretary of Defense must designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft acquisition program within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The engine development and procurement programs for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft must be designated as major subprograms within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements, and may restructure the programs following critical cost growth. The Secretary will use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements and may restructure the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program, as well as the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs, following critical cost growth. In 2010, reassessment and actions were conducted for the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs to meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. Actions taken in accordance with this reassessment will be considered to meet the requirements of the designated major subprogram. The paragraph discusses how meeting the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code for a major subprogram is contingent on the Secretary of Defense conducting a reassessment and taking actions. If programmatic changes cause a significant increase in costs post-enactment, the requirements are not considered met. The report accompanying H.R. 5136, H.Rept. 111-491, includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, stating that meeting requirements for a subprogram under section 2433a of title 10, United States Code is contingent on cost increases not exceeding the critical cost growth threshold. The budget request contained $2.4 billion for development of the F-35 aircraft. The report H.Rept. 111-491 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, stating the budget request contained $2.4 billion for development of the F-35 aircraft and no funds for a competitive propulsion system. It also mentions $7.7 billion for procurement of F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C aircraft. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, despite the requirement for a competitive alternative engine to the F135 engine. Congress has consistently appropriated funds for this purpose. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not included funds for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request, despite the requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act. The committee noted cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50 percent increase in F135 engine development costs, now estimated at $7.3 billion. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported a 50 percent increase in F135 engine development costs, now estimated at $7.3 billion. The negotiated prices for the F-35B engine and lift fan were 21 percent higher than budget estimates, while the F-35A engine's negotiated unit cost was 42 percent higher than budgeted for fiscal year 2009. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to review the F135 cost structure, which concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to review the F135 cost structure. The JAT concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. An update in 2010 noted that $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development. The committee received an update on the 2007 DOD report on the Joint Strike Fighter Alternate Engine Acquisition, stating that $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to complete F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The report also mentioned that long-term costs for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same. Given the cost increases in F135 development and procurement, the committee is puzzled by the long-term costs of a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy. The committee is puzzled by the Department's decisions to not include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests despite the benefits of a two-engine competitive program. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in the F-35, citing better engine performance, contractor responsiveness, industrial base, engine reliability, and operational readiness as key factors. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor have not met cost and schedule expectations, leading to the recommendation for the increase. The F-35 program, including PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M, failed to meet cost and schedule expectations. Reviews conducted by the Department of Defense highlighted these shortcomings, leading to the need for independent assessments like JET 2 and IMRT. JET 2 estimated a 30-year development program for the F-35. The Department of Defense chartered an independent manufacturing review team (IMRT) and the JET 2 to assess the F-35 program. The JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion increase in costs, while the IMRT identified high production risk. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense plans to procure an additional F-35C aircraft, establish a software simulation facility, and use operational F-35s for developmental testing. The Department of Defense plans to reduce production risk by acquiring an additional F-35C test aircraft, setting up a software simulation facility, using operational F-35s for testing, adjusting production in line with IMRT recommendations, and increasing budget for F-35 development. These actions will delay F-35 development by 13 months and cost an additional $2.8 billion. The Department of Defense plans to reduce production risk by acquiring an additional F-35C test aircraft, setting up a software simulation facility, using operational F-35s for testing, adjusting production in line with IMRT recommendations, and increasing budget for F-35 development. This will delay F-35 development by 13 months and cost an additional $2.8 billion. The F-35 program is projected to exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent compared to the original baseline estimate, with unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. The F-35 program is facing issues with late delivery of test aircraft and a failure to adjust to reality in system development and resourcing, as highlighted in testimonies before Senate committees. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development and test plans. The DOD plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The DOD plans to procure 307 aircraft costing $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The committee notes that 22% of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s will be requested by the Department by spring 2015. Despite findings and continued research, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains the same. The committee remains concerned about the procurement of 2,443 F-35 aircraft before completing developmental testing. Despite findings and continued research, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged. The GAO highlighted significant risks and potential costly retrofitting due to required design changes. The committee is concerned about the impact of required design changes on F-35 production, suggesting alterations to the process and supply base. They recommend reducing the production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete. The budget request for 42 aircraft in fiscal year 2011 is subject to completion of certain milestones by the Department. The committee recommends reducing the production ramp rate of F-35 aircraft until developmental testing is complete. The budget request for 42 aircraft in fiscal year 2011 is subject to certain milestones being completed by the Department. A provision requires certification that these milestones have been met before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft can proceed. The committee recommends reducing the production ramp rate of F-35 aircraft until developmental testing is complete. The Department must certify that certain milestones have been completed before procuring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration objects to adding $485 million for the extra engine program and legislative provisions limiting JSF development funding. The committee recommends reducing F-35 production until testing is complete. Secretary Gates notes the extra engine needs $2.4 billion more to be viable for the JSF program. The Department does not believe the $2.4 billion investment in an extra engine for the JSF program will ever be recovered or should be diverted from important defense needs. The current engine is performing well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. The report recommends a provision to limit funds for the alternative F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The President's advisors would recommend a veto if the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program. The committee recommends a provision to require certification from the Secretary of Defense before spending additional funds on the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The certification must show that the alternate propulsion system will reduce costs, improve fleet readiness, and not disrupt the program. The provision in H.R. 6523 requires certification from the Secretary of Defense before spending more on the F136 engine for the F-35 program. It must demonstrate cost reduction, fleet readiness improvement, and program continuity. No specific funding amount is mentioned for the alternate engine in the bill. The Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding H.R. 6523, designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Milestone B decision will be used as the original baseline for reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense designates an engine program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Milestone B decision serves as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions may be taken following critical cost growth. During fiscal year 2010, the Lightning II aircraft program underwent reassessment and actions as required by section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The F-35 engine development and procurement program also underwent reassessment based on the original baseline. Actions taken in accordance with these requirements are considered to meet the necessary standards. Actions taken in accordance with section 2433a of title 10, United States Code for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) will meet the requirements of the major subprogram. However, these actions will only be considered to meet the requirements to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would necessitate a reassessment and actions pursuant to section 2433a upon enactment of this Act. The requirements of section 2433a will not be considered met for the subprogram if additional programmatic actions are needed. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act requires the Secretary of Defense to reassess and take actions for a subprogram under section 2433a. If programmatic changes cause cost increases beyond a threshold, the requirements of section 2433a will not be met. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version did not allocate funds for the program. The House Appropriations Committee did not report a separate defense bill for FY2011. The Senate version of the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included no funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The program was funded at the FY2010 level from October 1, 2010, through March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Vote on Alternate Engine Funding took place on February 16, 2011, as part of its consideration of H.R. 1. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011, including no funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) provided funding for DOD for the remainder of FY2011, excluding funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in establishing this program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. The \"Great Engine War\" was an annual competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 to produce engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. The Air Force pursued an alternate engine for the F-16 due to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management and concerns about using a single type of engine for their fighter fleet. The \"Great Engine War\" was an annual competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 to produce engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. Congress provided funding for General Electric to develop the F101 engine as an alternate engine for the F-16, leading to the development of the F110 engine. The competition aimed to address Air Force frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management and concerns about using a single type of engine for their fighter fleet. The \"Great Engine War\" was an annual competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 to produce engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. The F110 engine was developed by General Electric as an alternate engine for the F-16, competing with the F100 engine. The competition aimed to improve engine durability and reliability, with the use of annual competitions for engine procurement being controversial. Contractor responsiveness was seen as the primary benefit of the competition. The \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric for F-16 engines aimed to improve durability and reliability. Contractor responsiveness, not cost savings, was the main benefit. Competition led to better contract terms, warranties, and support stability for the Department of Defense. The \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric for F-16 engines resulted in benefits for the Department of Defense, including better contract terms, warranties, and support stability. A 1987 assessment highlighted that competition led to earlier engine improvements offered by the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney, exceeding Air Force expectations. The management of the engine competition played a crucial role in achieving these benefits. The Air Force managed the engine competition by demanding cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for six years before awarding contracts. Firm-fixed price contracts were negotiated for six years from the first production lot, leading to benefits for the Department of Defense. The Air Force obtained cost projections for six years from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney before awarding firm-fixed price contracts for the first production lot. This was a new approach as contractors had never before agreed to provide future cost projections. Additionally, the Department of Defense required contractors to provide plans for dual sources of critical parts to prevent disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sources of critical parts to prevent disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011 due to continued uncertainty in development and production. The Fighter Engine Team (FET) has decided to stop self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) beyond 2011 due to uncertainty in the program's schedules. GE and Rolls-Royce leadership jointly made this decision, acknowledging the challenges that impact the potential benefits of continuing the F136 development effort. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program in April, with the engine development nearly 80 percent complete. The FET has decided to end self-funded development of the F136 engine for the JSF, despite being almost 80 percent complete. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program in April, and the FET will now fulfill its termination responsibilities with the federal government. The FET developed a competitive fighter engine for JSF with advanced propulsion technologies and patented technologies. Six F136 development engines underwent over 1,200 hours of testing before the program was terminated. The FET consistently met cost and schedule goals, receiving high marks from the DoD. GE and Rolls-Royce advocated for defense acquisition reform and offered fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines. GE and Rolls-Royce were praised by the DoD for their successful joint venture in developing a competitive fighter engine for the JSF program. They advocated for defense acquisition reform and emphasized the importance of competition in the process."
