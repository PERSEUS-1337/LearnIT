    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers have a significantly higher fatality and crash rate compared to older drivers, with 167 deaths per week. Teenage drivers between 16 and 20 years old have a fatality rate 4 times higher than drivers between 25 and 70 years old, and 16-year-old drivers have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than drivers between 30 and 60 years old. Teenage drivers comprise slightly more than one-third of all fatalities in motor vehicle crashes they are involved in. According to research, teenage drivers have a high fatality and crash rate, with 2/3 of fatalities in crashes involving them being other drivers, passengers, or pedestrians. The chance of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers' performance. Teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years old are at a higher risk of crashes at night, despite only 20% of their driving occurring during nighttime. Teenage drivers aged 15 to 20 are at a higher risk of crashes at night, with over 50% of fatalities occurring during nighttime. The implementation of Florida's graduated driver licensing system in 1997 led to a 9% decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers aged 15 to 18. Crash rates involving 16-year-old drivers have also decreased according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Between 1995 and 1999, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 25-27% in Michigan and North Carolina due to the implementation of comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. California's graduated driver licensing program also saw a decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries between 1998 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, California's graduated driver licensing program led to a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries involving 16-year-old drivers, as well as a 24% decline in at-fault collisions. Over 40 states and the District of Columbia have implemented similar 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that many states have not implemented basic safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult. A 2001 Harris Poll shows strong support for laws protecting teenage and novice drivers, including requirements for practice driving hours, a learner's permit period, and limits on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws are outlined in Section 3. State compliance with graduated driver licensing laws requires novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process before getting an unrestricted license, starting with a learner's permit at 16 years old or older. The 2-stage licensing process for novice drivers under 21 includes a learner's permit stage starting at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, prohibiting cellphone use and night driving, until the intermediate stage begins. The intermediate stage of the 2-stage licensing process for novice drivers under 21 starts immediately after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, and prohibits nighttime driving. The intermediate stage of the 2-stage licensing process for novice drivers under 21 starts immediately after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits nighttime driving, restricts cell phone use, limits non-familial passengers under 21 to one unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 21. The intermediate stage of the 2-stage licensing process for novice drivers under 21 includes restrictions on nighttime driving, cell phone use, and non-familial passengers under 21, limited to one unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 21. Additionally, the driver must not operate a motor vehicle with more than 1 non-familial passenger younger than 21 years of age unless a licensed driver who is at least 21 years of age is present. These restrictions remain in effect until the driver reaches 18 years of age. The Secretary of Transportation may require additional conditions for learner's permits, including 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver over 21. The Secretary of Transportation may impose additional requirements for learner's permits, such as 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver over 21. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage, a driving-related offense like driving while intoxicated or misrepresentation of age can result in automatic delay of obtaining an unrestricted driver's license. The Secretary of Transportation will establish rules regarding driving-related offenses, including driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or any other offense determined by the Secretary. The Secretary of Transportation will establish regulations for driving-related offenses, including speeding and other offenses determined by the Secretary, through the rulemaking process. Incentive grants will be provided as per Section 4. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application including a certification of compliance by the Governor. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States based on their applications, including a certification of compliance by the Governor. Amounts appropriated for this purpose will be apportioned to each State in compliance with section 3(a) for each fiscal year. Each fiscal year, funds will be apportioned to compliant States based on the ratio of funds apportioned to each State under section 402 of title 23, United States Code. These funds can be used for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process that complies with section 3(a)(2). Funds received by a State from a grant awarded under this section can be used for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials related to the State's graduated driver licensing law, and carrying out administrative activities. The Secretary can use funds for enforcing the 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials, and other administrative activities. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for this purpose from the Highway Trust Fund. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth fiscal year, the withholding increases to 5 percent. During the fifth fiscal year after the Act's enactment, the Secretary will withhold 5 percent of funds from states not complying with section 3(a). During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not complying with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. Funds withheld from non-compliant states under section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code, will remain available for distribution until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. Funds withheld under subsection (a) will remain available for distribution to the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. Any amount withheld after the sixth fiscal year may not be distributed to the State. The enactment of this Act prohibits the distribution of withheld funds to the State. If the State complies with section 3(a) before the funds' availability period ends, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the withheld amounts to the State for apportionment. If a State complies with section 3(a) before the funds' availability period ends, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the withheld amounts to the State for apportionment. The distributed funds remain available for expenditure by the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the year of apportionment, after which any unspent amount reverts back to the Treasury of the United States. Noncompliance with section 3(a) results in the funds not being distributed to the State. Any unspent funds apportioned to a State must be expended by the end of the third fiscal year following apportionment, or they will revert back to the Treasury of the United States if the State is not in compliance with section 3(a)."
