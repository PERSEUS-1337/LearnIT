    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 is the exercise of authority over nuclear weapon operations by the President as Commander in Chief. The infrastructure supporting this authority is the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is the infrastructure that supports the President and his Unified Command Commanders in exercising authority over nuclear weapon operations. It includes facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel essential for planning, directing, and controlling military forces' nuclear weapon operations. The NCCS provides the President with all capabilities required for decision-making. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) integrates essential elements for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. It supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons and is part of Continuity of Government activities, warranting Congressional oversight. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans for sustaining and modernizing the NCCS. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is essential for planning and controlling nuclear weapon operations, supporting the President's authority. Congress oversees Department of Defense's plans for modernizing the NCCS, with potential for revisiting its structure and relevance. The NCCS architecture still reflects its Cold War origins despite recent reviews and publications. The NCCS architecture, shaped during the Cold War, may need restructuring due to changing threats. Analysts suggest potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran, driving the need for robust NC2. Non-nuclear responses and active defenses could also add complexity to the system. The NCCS architecture, shaped during the Cold War, may need restructuring due to changing threats from China, North Korea, or Iran. Analysts suggest robust NC2 is necessary, along with non-nuclear responses and active defenses, which could drive complex requirements. Despite strategic and budgetary implications, the NCCS is not well understood outside the military establishment. The NCCS, including the NMCS, plays a crucial role in national defense. Despite its strategic importance, it is not well understood outside the military. This report will discuss NCCS platforms, functions, current role in light of past recommendations, and proposed modernization initiatives. The National Military Command System (NMCS) is a key component of the National Command and Control System (NCCS), providing command and control for the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes command nodes and supporting components for both nuclear and conventional forces. The National Military Command System (NMCS) includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC), which is the primary location for national command and control on a day-to-day basis. Staffed around-the-clock, the NMCC is responsible for monitoring nuclear activities. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is the primary location for national command and control, staffed around-the-clock by watch teams led by a General or Admiral. Located in a shielded room in the Pentagon, the NMCC monitors nuclear forces and military operations, with additional response cells available in crisis. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC, with an aircraft always on alert for command and control capabilities. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) is a fleet of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. It serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities, with communications hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). USSTRATCOM provides personnel and day-to-day administration for the NAOC. The Site-R at Fort Ritchie, Maryland, and the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, are hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and serve as alternate locations for emergency actions. USSTRATCOM provides personnel and administration for these facilities. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska serves as a backup location for essential emergency actions and as the command center for the USSTRATCOM Commander. The facility is protected against EMP, has its own emergency power supply, and is staffed 24/7 by teams led by a Senior Controller. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska is protected against EMP and has its own emergency power supply. It is staffed 24/7 by teams led by a Senior Controller. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) serves as a survivable airborne backup with modified Boeing 707 aircraft and a crew of 22. Each battle staff is led by a General or Admiral. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft serving as a survivable airborne backup. Each aircraft carries a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel led by a General or Admiral. The aircraft fulfills key missions as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) and the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. The E-6B aircraft can relay launch codes to ICBM facilities and serve as a TACAMO relay for Navy submarines. It can communicate with submarines using a trailing wire antenna and VLF/LF system, as well as UHF or EHF satellite systems. The aircraft and crew are from the Navy's STRATCOMM Wing One at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that serves as a survivable road-mobile backup to the USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP, with the fundamental premise that only the President can direct the use of nuclear weapons through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is designed to serve the President's needs for strategic decision-making regarding nuclear weapons. One of its key functions is situation monitoring, which involves monitoring intelligence from various sources to anticipate potential events or threats. The NCCS command elements monitor strategic intelligence from classified and open sources to anticipate events. Intelligence cells linked to national systems help with crisis anticipation. 24-hour news services like CNN can also provide early indicators. Weather tracking is important for aircraft operations. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) is crucial for quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks. Situation monitoring includes tracking weather for aircraft operations. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) is vital for quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks. Dual phenomenology is used for verifying missile launches and determining the origin, size, and potential targets of an attack. The TW/AA centers use dual phenomenology, involving satellites and radars, to verify attacks and provide critical information for decision-making, including the President consulting with senior commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the primary military advisor. Connectivity between systems is essential for effective decision-making. The President, with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the primary military advisor, consults with other advisors for decision-making on employing nuclear weapons. The system ensures connectivity between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders for continuous updates. Data on nuclear deterrent readiness, forces available, locations, and maintenance/supply status is crucial for decision makers in both daily operations and crises. The force management process collects data on the readiness of the nuclear deterrent and supporting forces, presenting it in easily understandable formats for key leadership. This includes forces available, locations, maintenance/supply status, and alerting forces during a crisis. Force direction involves nuclear surety (preventing unauthorized use of nuclear weapons) and positive control. Direction. This function includes two key aspects of nuclear command and control: nuclear surety (preventing unauthorized use of nuclear weapons) and positive control (ensuring instructions to launch nuclear weapons reach the forces). Force direction involves both employing forces and ending hostilities. The National Military Command System (NMCS) must be survivable in extreme environments to ensure national leadership can control forces during a crisis. Survivability can be achieved through hardening, mobility, redundancy, or concealment. The National Military Command System (NMCS) must be survivable in extreme environments such as blast, heat, fallout, EMP, chemical, or biological scenarios. It should also be reliable, supporting rapid connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events without generating false alarms or passing inaccurate information. Additionally, the system needs to be secure, limiting access to authorized personnel and ensuring the authenticity of communications. The National Military Command System (NMCS) must be secure, limiting access to authorized personnel and ensuring the authenticity of communications. Security is crucial to prevent hostile listening or intercept of communications, especially as potential adversaries adopt asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks. Nuclear command and control is central to the deterrence construct according to the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted nuclear command and control as crucial for deterrence. Congress directed the review to include the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible nuclear deterrence posture, and the relationship with targeting strategy. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for maintaining a credible nuclear deterrence posture in the United States, including nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the relationship with arms control objectives. The curr_chunk discusses the nuclear weapons complex, stockpile, and briefing on the NPR report by Assistant Secretary Crouch on January 9, 2002. Assistant Secretary Crouch briefed on the unclassified aspects of the NPR report, highlighting the need for changes in the multinational environment post-Cold War. The evolution aimed to reduce dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence and address emerging threats from multiple political opponents. The NPR report emphasized the need for a reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence and addressed emerging threats from multiple political opponents, particularly related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. The \"capabilities based approach\" aimed to provide the President with a wide range of options to tailor the national response to potential adversaries. The NPR report advocated for a \"capabilities based approach\" to provide the President with a range of options to tailor the national response to adversaries. It introduced a \"new triad\" of capabilities including offensive and defensive forces to enhance flexibility and reduce reliance on offensive systems. The NPR's new triad includes offensive and defensive forces, with a focus on command, control, intelligence, and planning to enhance precision and adaptability in confronting emerging threats and improving deterrence. The NPR's new triad emphasizes enhanced command and control for improved precision in strike and defense forces, adaptive planning for confronting emerging threats, and better integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces to increase flexibility in changing situations. This focus on NC2 capabilities could lead to new systems initiatives. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense are implementing the framework of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, with a focus on enhancing command and control capabilities for improved precision in strike and defense forces. USSTRATCOM has taken on additional missions, including global strike and space functions, following the latest revision of the Unified Command Plan. USSTRATCOM has assumed responsibility for additional missions in the latest revision of the Unified Command Plan, including global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. In January 2005, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated USSTRATCOM as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for this purpose by September 2005. In January 2005, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated USSTRATCOM as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. By September 2005, General James Cartwright established a Center for this purpose in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. This institutionalized the post-Cold War environment view from the 2001 NPR, with DOD incorporating NPR thinking into its doctrinal guidance for military commanders. The Joint Staff was reported to be preparing an update to its doctrine in 2005. The 2001 NPR's post-Cold War environment view was institutionalized in the mission portfolio. DOD is incorporating NPR thinking into doctrinal guidance for military commanders. The Joint Staff is updating its doctrine, focusing on deterring weapons of mass destruction and crisis action planning for nuclear command and control. The Joint Staff is updating its doctrine to focus on deterring weapons of mass destruction and crisis action planning for nuclear command and control, emphasizing rapid response to unanticipated WMD threats. Reports suggest that the new joint doctrine may have been cancelled. The Joint Staff is updating its doctrine to focus on deterring weapons of mass destruction and crisis action planning for nuclear command and control, emphasizing rapid response to unanticipated WMD threats. This concept is a carry-over from the 2001 NPR and involves time-sensitive development of joint operations plans and orders in response to an imminent crisis. The need for rapid planning has been recognized in conventional combatant commands for years, while nuclear planning has typically been seen as a long-term deliberate effort. To compress the time required for developing and disseminating plans to nuclear forces during a crisis, there may be a need for increased computer workstation capability and availability at nuclear command centers. To expedite nuclear planning during a crisis, nuclear command centers may need to enhance computer workstation capability and communication capacity. Networked collaborative planning systems, common in conventional military operations, could also be utilized for nuclear planning. Senior leaders are increasingly expecting robust communications for long-distance deliberations and analysis, including video-teleconferencing links. Coordination with intelligence providers for WMD targets requires reliable communication channels. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to appoint a commission to review nuclear planning capabilities. The Secretary of Defense appointed a commission to review nuclear planning capabilities, focusing on implementing the 2001 NPR goals. The commission is required to submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The commission appointed by the Secretary of Defense is reviewing nuclear planning capabilities to achieve the NPR goals, including an examination of NC2 requirements. The commission is expected to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear or \"non-kinetic\" weapons to fulfill missions previously assigned to nuclear weapons, potentially leading to a smaller arsenal. However, the presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The presence of precision non-nuclear or \"non-kinetic\" weapons in the U.S. arsenal may fulfill missions previously assigned to nuclear weapons, potentially leading to a smaller arsenal. The overarching approach to nuclear weapons policy will determine the required command and control architecture, influenced by assumptions about deterrent capabilities and the NC2 system's survivability. Today's nuclear command and control systems have evolved to their current configuration. The nuclear command and control systems, originating during the Cold War, focused on managing a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. Key installations like the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were established in the 1960s-1980s. These systems have seen minimal changes since the Cold War era. The USSTRATCOM underground command post was built between 1986 and 1989 to manage a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The post-Cold War environment may require new programs as the current infrastructure may not fully meet new requirements. The nature of the threat can shape challenges to the NC2 infrastructure. The post-Cold War environment may require new programs for the NCCS due to evolving threats. A key concern during the Cold War was the risk of a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national leadership to disrupt nuclear command and control. During the Cold War, there was a concern over a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership to disrupt nuclear command and control, potentially leading to a loss of political control over conflict escalation. Upgrades to nuclear command and control were implemented in the 1980s to ensure government control of the weapons. During the Cold War, upgrades to nuclear command and control were implemented in the 1980s to ensure government control of the weapons. The threat of a decapitation attack targeting national and military leadership has diminished, with U.S. policy no longer considering the relationship with Russia adversarial. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty committed both sides to reduce deployed nuclear weapons. In 2002, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty committed the US and Russia to reduce deployed nuclear weapons. With the relationship no longer adversarial, the need for a costly command and control architecture designed for a major nuclear exchange is being questioned. Despite the demise of the Soviet Union, analysts question the justification for the costly command and control architecture designed for a major nuclear exchange in the current strategic and fiscally constrained environment. There is concern about a potential nuclear threat from China, with DOD analysts estimating significant military expenditures from China, including the acquisition of more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. China's military expenditures could reach $90 billion in 2005 and triple by 2025. They are acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM, with ICBM systems that can target the United States. General Zhu Chenghu threatened to attack U.S. cities with nuclear weapons if the U.S. aids Taiwan against China. Peter Brooks suggested China may seek preeminence in the Pacific Rim and East. Peter Brooks from the Heritage Foundation suggested that China may be striving for preeminence in the Pacific Rim and East Asia. Kurt Campbell from the Center for Strategic and International Studies mentioned that the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, emphasizing areas of cooperation in U.S. and European relationships. The relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Cooperation characterizes the U.S. and European relationships with China, and the idea of a \"China threat\" may be a search for a great power peer competitor. This could lead to the development of major weapons systems to satisfy the military's needs. The increasing Chinese nuclear capability, along with potential hostile relations, could pose a renewed threat to the nuclear command and control system. Analysts also highlight the threats posed by rogue states like Iran and North Korea, reinforcing the need for a viable NC2. North Korea has been actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability since the 1960s, with A.Q. Khan possibly providing information for Kim Jong Il's efforts. In February 2005, North Korea publicly announced it had nuclear weapons, but without evidence of a nuclear test, the claim is difficult to verify. In the 1990s, North Korea may have obtained information for its nuclear weapons program. Estimates suggest they may have up to ten bombs. North Korea also produces various missiles, including SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles with potential intercontinental range. The Resources Defense Council estimates North Korea may have up to ten nuclear bombs. North Korea manufactures SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles, but it is unclear if they can attach nuclear warheads to them. Reliable information on North Korea's nuclear programs is scarce, and experts are hesitant to make public estimates due to past intelligence failures and North Korean claims. The U.S. intelligence community is hesitant to publicly commit to estimates on North Korean programs due to post-Iraq criticisms. Some analysts believe North Korean claims of possessing nuclear weapons are deception efforts. The Iranian nuclear program presents dilemmas, with varying predictions on when they may acquire nuclear weapons. Israel predicts Iran could have a bomb within two years. Iran is believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons, with varying predictions on when they may acquire them. Some analysts suggest they could have the capability within two years, while others say by 2009. The secrecy surrounding Iran's nuclear activities has raised suspicions. Iran's nuclear activities, including research and development in the fuel cycle, are permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, Iran's secrecy at sites like Natanz has raised suspicions of developing long-range nuclear-capable delivery systems. Recent testing of the Shahab-3 missile and alleged plans for a nuclear weapon nose-cone have heightened concerns. Reports suggest Iran's military is studying high explosives, crucial for nuclear weapon construction. Iran's military is studying high explosives essential for nuclear weapon construction, raising concerns about hostile Iranian intentions. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. Iran's military is studying high explosives essential for nuclear weapon construction, raising concerns about hostile Iranian intentions. Small nuclear arsenals could threaten U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a high-altitude nuclear explosion, causing damage to power lines, communications cables, and electronic components, leading to the failure of critical systems like air traffic control, medical care, and food distribution. The potential threat of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control, medical care, and food distribution, could lead to cascading failures similar to those seen after Hurricane Katrina. The EMP Commission was tasked by Congress to assess and report on the scope of this threat, with analysts warning of potential catastrophic consequences. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to analyze the threat of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, which could result in catastrophic consequences. Analysts suggest that China might use EMP against the US as part of its nuclear capability strategy, as indicated in Chinese military literature. Experts suggest that North Korea and Iran may be preparing for an EMP attack, possibly using short-range missiles launched from freighters off the US coast. Technology advancements could enable more localized EMP bursts. Some analysts suggest that North Korea and Iran may be preparing for an EMP attack, possibly using short-range missiles launched from freighters off the US coast. Technology advancements could enable more localized EMP bursts, raising concerns about the potential impact on military and commercial systems. Some commercial and military systems have EMP protection, and the threat of a single weapon attack from a freighter off the U.S. coast may not cause catastrophic failures. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear, but using it against U.S. forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Some analysts suggest North Korea may be preparing for an EMP attack. Some analysts suggest that North Korea or Iran, let alone a terrorist group, would find it extremely difficult to develop a nuclear weapon capable of generating large area EMP effects. The EMP Commission found that maintenance of EMP hardening and practice of EMP procedures in the military may have declined since the 1990s. Congress directed reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems and progress on protecting them from EMP threats. The EMP Commission was reestablished with a deadline to deliver a report by June 30, 2007, focusing on the vulnerability of military systems to EMP threats. The report highlighted the challenges faced by the nuclear command and control system in integrating new missions and technologies. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review introduced new missions including non-nuclear responses and active defenses, posing challenges for the nuclear command and control system. Improvements may be needed to integrate nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as defensive forces, potentially requiring an expansion of the decision-making process and capacity. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review introduced new missions, including non-nuclear responses and active defenses, which may require an expansion of the decision-making process to include additional participants. Implementation of the NPR recommendations could drive a demand for additional capacity and speed in missile defense response. Further development is needed in directing the release of non-nuclear strikes, including conventional attacks. The need for further development in directing the release of non-nuclear strikes, including conventional attacks against strategic targets using precision weapons or conventional ballistic missiles, and \"non-kinetic options\" like information operations and electronic warfare, poses questions about release authority. The need for determining release authority for non-nuclear and non-kinetic options, such as electronic warfare and special operations forces strikes, raises questions about presidential involvement in military operations. The President's involvement in military operations is typically limited, with historic exceptions like Lyndon Johnson's personal selection of targets during the Vietnam War. Recent campaigns against Iraq and Kosovo did not involve the President in planning specific missions. However, targets that USSTRATCOM might respond to could be of strategic importance, warranting Presidential involvement. The President's involvement in military operations is usually limited, with exceptions like Lyndon Johnson's selection of targets during the Vietnam War. Recent campaigns against Iraq and Kosovo did not require Presidential planning. However, targets that USSTRATCOM might respond to could be of strategic importance, warranting Presidential involvement. Presidential authorization for releasing strikes could pose technical and operational challenges, as conventional weapons do not have the same safeguards as nuclear weapons. The process of releasing strikes may pose technical and operational challenges, especially when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. It is crucial to ensure that only conventional weapons are launched when ordered. The process of releasing strikes may pose technical and operational challenges, especially when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. It will be essential to ensure a process that only launches conventional weapons when ordered. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have strategic impacts, potentially equivalent to a WMD strike, and should be treated as such. Some argue that non-kinetic strikes, like cyber-attacks, could have strategic impacts equivalent to a WMD strike and should be treated as such. Concerns have been raised about the need for detailed Presidential involvement and control in such situations, but technical solutions for enforcing control have not been discussed. Adding non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses may involve participants from other communities with different disciplines and protocols. Adding non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses to the command and control process may involve participants from different communities with varying disciplines and protocols. This could lead to the need for revised approval processes to prevent delays in decision-making and execution, potentially causing critical targets to be missed. The integration of active defenses, such as missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture is also a key consideration. The integration of active defenses, like missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation. Decisions may be needed on which locations to defend, potentially involving Presidential involvement due to limited defensive capabilities. Time constraints could lead to critical targets being missed if decision-making and execution processes are not streamlined. Some analysts recommend delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander to prevent missing opportunities to stop incoming missiles. This could involve choosing between defensive launches or offensive strikes as the national response. Delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander, possibly with Presidential guidance, is recommended. Decision-making between defensive launches and offensive strikes may require Presidential consideration. Coordination of offensive and defensive conversations is crucial for timely decision-making. Defensive success could impact offensive response options, while a strong attack may necessitate an early offensive response. A successful defensive response may influence offensive response options. Including defensive responses in decision-making after detecting a potential attack adds participants with inputs to consider in the short time frame before impact. Regional combatant commanders will be responsible for defense in their area of responsibility. Regional combatant commanders will have responsibility for defense in their area of responsibility, with multiple command centers involved. USSTRATCOM is tasked with leading missile defense, which must be linked to systems in regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure readiness. The regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM will have theater missile defense responsibilities and receive warning data. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure interoperability of missile defense command and control systems with common technical standards. Bandwidth demands on networks will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense and non-nuclear offensive responses. The bandwidth demands on networks will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense and non-nuclear offensive responses. The command and control system must present choices for Presidential decision in an easily understandable manner to facilitate interaction with advisers. The system must present choices for Presidential decision in a clear and understandable manner, aiding interactions with advisers and ensuring tight control of nuclear weapons. It should support civilian and military leadership in nuclear operations. The importance of maintaining tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons and ensuring clear and actionable orders for weapons operators is crucial. Nuclear command and control systems have value beyond nuclear operations, supporting military and government functions. These systems can serve multiple missions in non-nuclear roles, providing versatile national assets with tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities. They can also support non-nuclear military forces direction. The nuclear command and control systems have versatile national assets with tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities. They support non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring, including aiding in crises, conflicts, and peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. A response cell or crisis action team (CAT) can be formed from various agencies to prepare orders and monitor operations. The NMCC aids in managing peacetime contingencies like natural disasters and crises. A response cell or crisis action team can be formed from various agencies to prepare orders and monitor forces. Command and control assets also support mitigation and recovery activities after events like the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and NMCC were involved in coordinating air traffic restoration after the September 11, 2001 attacks. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush visited USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on September 11, 2001 for updates from a secure facility. During domestic contingencies or natural disasters, President Bush utilized command and control assets at USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on September 11, 2001, to receive updates and communicate with his national security staff. He also used assets at U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita in September 2005. Nuclear command and control assets can support civil authorities for consequence mitigation after disasters or domestic events. During Hurricane Rita in September 2005, command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command were used to monitor the government response. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have an agreement to make the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) available for FEMA support during disasters. NAOC was utilized during Hurricane Opal in 1995. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) is a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. It was used during Hurricane Opal in 1995 and is valued for its versatile situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities by senior government leadership. The NMCC is co-located in the Pentagon, easily accessible to the Secretary of Defense and other DOD leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld relied on the NAOC for support during official travel, such as trips to Iraq and Central Asia. The NMCC, located in the Pentagon, is easily accessible to DOD leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld relied on the NAOC for support during official travel. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and could lead to competition for access during crises, potentially causing shortfalls in response plans. Tying these systems to other agency functions adds to the organizations with interests in their continued viability. The event of a crisis may create shortfalls in response plans that rely on system availability. Connecting these systems to other agency functions, like FEMA, adds to the organizations with interests in their continued viability. This could lead to additional costs for the military to maintain systems that are no longer needed, and using platforms for secondary roles can strain military operators and decrease readiness for primary missions. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to conduct an \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System\" chaired by Brent Scowcroft. This review considered the requirements for today's systems amidst changing threats and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review. The use of platforms for secondary roles can strain military operators and decrease readiness for primary missions. The DOD committee, chaired by Brent Scowcroft in 2001, conducted an \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System\" to address requirements for modern systems. The review focused on survivability, balancing authorized use, preventing unauthorized use, and considering new technology and threats. The End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System highlighted concerns about the degradation of system hardening and procedural discipline since the Cold War. Additionally, it recommended shifting NC2 systems life cycle management to operators. The End-to-End Review suggested transferring NC2 systems life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community, similar to how Air Force aircraft programs are managed. This shift aims to address operator requirements for new capabilities that are often not met in the current systems or modifications. The End-to-End Review proposed transferring NC2 systems life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community to address operator requirements for new capabilities that may not be supported by current systems or modifications. However, relying solely on operator-generated requirements for acquisition programs may lead to unrealistic expectations exceeding program constraints. The focus on operator-generated requirements for acquisition programs can be problematic, as they may be unrealistic and exceed program constraints. Additionally, there is a concern about the decline in the number of people with NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War. The debate continues on meeting operator needs and managing acquisition programs economically. There is also a concern about the decline in the number of people with NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War, leading to a \"brain drain\" in the services. The military services are facing a \"brain drain\" of people with expertise in nuclear operations due to reduced manpower and the need for individuals to master multiple specialties. This lack of depth in key NC2 positions could hinder responses during crises and may be further challenged by the Defense Department's military transformation efforts. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's military transformation efforts. US Strategic Command is moving towards more network-oriented, distributed operations with subordinate functional component commands established for specific mission aspects. These multi-service organizations are geographically separated, facilitating decentralization. The US Strategic Command is transitioning to decentralized operations with functional components like global strike and space operations being activated. This move away from hierarchical methods towards a more collaborative process is part of the Defense Department's military transformation efforts. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends changes to NC2 programs to support this shift to distributed command and control capabilities. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes changes in NC2 programs to support USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. Recommendations include retiring E-4B NAOC aircraft and procuring C-32 aircraft as replacements. The NAOC capability for FEMA support would shift to E-6B aircraft with additional communication upgrades. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 as the new distributed architecture meets survivability requirements. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes changes in NC2 programs to support USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. Recommendations include retiring E-4B NAOC aircraft and procuring C-32 aircraft as replacements. The NAOC capability for FEMA support would shift to E-6B aircraft with additional communication upgrades. USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 as the new distributed architecture meets survivability requirements, emphasizing the need for survivable command and control capabilities in the face of various threats. The Department of Defense proposes tailored systems for WMD elimination, requiring a robust communications infrastructure. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based communications architecture for linking distributed locations, but the high assurance of rapid message transmission needed for nuclear command and control is not yet proven with this technology. IP routing may not prioritize high-priority nuclear force direction messages over other traffic. The application for high assurance rapid message transmission in nuclear command and control has not been proven. IP routing may not prioritize high-priority nuclear force direction messages over other traffic. The communications bandwidth required for this infrastructure is already limited, with significant growth in capacity requirements over the past decade. The nuclear community will face challenges in competing for satellite communications links due to increasing demand. The DOD has seen a 500% growth in communications capacity needs over the past decade, with a 1000% increase in satellite communications links since 9/11. The nuclear community will compete for command and control links, facing challenges due to dispersed operations and integration of new systems. Certification and configuration management requirements for the NC2 network are still undetermined. Integration of new centers and systems, like missile defense or conventional strike, into the NC2 network requires coordination. The level of certification and configuration management needed is still undecided. Reconciliation of procedures in a distributed architecture is crucial to prevent chaos. Clear definition and enforcement of the chain of command and empowered level are necessary as more agencies access equivalent data. In a distributed architecture, clear procedures and protocols are crucial to prevent chaos. As more agencies access equivalent data, defining the chain of command and empowered level for directing action is essential. DOD's budget requests in FY2006 and FY2007 included procurement programs for upgrades and enhancements to the nuclear command and control system, particularly the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) valued at $20.5 million. The DOD's budget requests in FY2006 and FY2007 included upgrades and enhancements to the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) valued at $20.5 million for procurement and $57.3 million for research and development (R&D) in FY2006. Congress authorized these amounts in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. For FY2007, DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act funded $49 million for R&D but no money for procurement. The FY2007 budget request includes $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Modernization efforts in MEECN involve upgrades for high data rate terminals and secure computer terminals used for transmitting emergency action messages. The modernization efforts in MEECN include upgrades to secure computer terminals and satellite communications systems for nuclear command centers and launch control centers. The Minuteman MEECN Program involves the installation of VLF and EHF communications for bomber and tanker forces, replacing unsustainable legacy systems. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is personally directing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R, consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. Secretary Rumsfeld is overseeing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R, consolidating them into two new centers in the Pentagon focused on tracking global crises and providing military advice to the President. These new facilities will be more secure against various threats. The Defense Department is planning to consolidate the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R into two new centers in the Pentagon to track global crises and provide military advice to the President. This effort aims to create more secure facilities against various threats and increase efficiency, with funding requested for planning and engineering work through 2011. The Defense Department requested funding for planning and engineering work through 2011 to consolidate the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R into two new centers in the Pentagon. Additionally, funding was requested for the development of a future system for missile warning and attack assessment at NORAD and USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center. The Defense Department requested $85.2 million in FY2006 for missile warning and attack assessment systems at NORAD and USSTRATCOM. For FY2007, they are asking for $50.9 million for further research and development. Additionally, funds are being requested to enhance airborne nuclear command and control capabilities. The Defense Department is requesting funds to enhance its airborne nuclear command and control platforms, the E-4B NAOC and the E-6B ABNCP. In FY2006, $85.3 million was requested for NAOC modifications, which was fully funded by Congress. In FY2007, $50.9 million is requested for further research and development. The Defense Department requested $85.3 million for NAOC modifications in FY2006, fully funded by Congress. In FY2007, $5.6 million is requested for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D, covering improvements to aircraft systems and safety. Specific updates include replacing analog with digital equipment and creating an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders. Updates for the E-6B aircraft include transitioning to digital equipment, creating an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders, improving the on-board LAN, upgrading navigation capabilities, and integrating with Global Air Traffic systems. The proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft include transitioning to digital equipment, improving cockpit displays, enhancing navigation systems, and conducting a service life assessment of the airframe. The upgrades would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The Navy's proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft include improved cockpit displays, enhanced navigation systems, and a service life assessment of the airframe. The modifications would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for the E-6 in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, matching the DOD's procurement request and funding R&D at $35.5 million. The Navy's proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft, including improved cockpit displays and navigation systems, are fully supported by Congress. The Defense Department is requesting funding for E-6 modifications and research for FY2007. The acquisition of the Advanced EHF communications satellite is a controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs. The Advanced EHF (AEHF) communications satellite is part of nuclear command and control modernization programs, replacing the aging MILSTAR satellite constellation. It offers secure, anti-jam communications at higher data rates and capacities. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are involved in the development. The AEHF system, with five satellites launched since 1994, provides secure, anti-jam communications at higher data rates. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the program. The Air Force requested funding in the FY2006 budget, which was fully funded by Congress. In the FY2007 budget proposal, DOD did not request any funding. In FY2006, Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF in the Defense Authorization and appropriations legislation. For FY2007, DOD is not requesting procurement funds as three satellites have already been purchased for the AEHF constellation. The Air Force is seeking $633 million for AEHF R&D in FY2007. However, AEHF has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, particularly in the development of communications encryption equipment. The AEHF program has experienced schedule delays and cost overruns, mainly due to technical issues with the communications encryption equipment. The first launch is now planned for 2008, with the program's total cost estimated to exceed $7 billion, resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. The AEHF program has faced delays and cost overruns, with a planned launch in 2008 now pushed to late 2004. The program's total cost is estimated to exceed $7 billion, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF aims to bridge MILSTAR and the TSAT program, incorporating advanced technologies like laser communication cross-links between satellites. Some suggest testing these technologies on AEHF satellites to reduce risks on TSAT. The TSAT program faced a two-year delay from Air Force plans in 2013 due to budget cuts and immature technologies. Suggestions were made to test advanced technologies on AEHF satellites first to reduce risks. Congress considered acquiring additional AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites in case of further TSAT delays in FY2006. In FY2006, Congress directed the Air Force to prepare an \"analysis of alternatives\" report on acquiring more AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites to bridge potential TSAT delays. Funding for TSAT was reduced by $400 million, with $120 million reserved for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued TSAT development. Increased demands on the nuclear command and control system were noted. The Congress approved $436-plus million for a program, reserving $120 million for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development for TSAT. The nuclear command and control system will face challenges in the future due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy. The system's legacy Cold War architecture may compete for budgetary priority against more immediately relevant conventional systems in today's threat environment and the war on terror. The nuclear command and control system (NCCS) may face challenges in the future due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy. Some argue for its value in fulfilling missions beyond traditional DOD purview, while others prioritize modernization initiatives within budget constraints. The NCCS faces challenges in meeting increased demands from the 2001 NPR and DOD policy. Key functions will remain crucial for as long as the US maintains a nuclear deterrent. The DOD is focusing on modernization within budget constraints, but may face competing pressures from conventional missions. USSTRATCOM's activation of functional component commands and recommendations in the 2006 QDR could signal a change in direction. Congress may need to address the nature of the threat. The USSTRATCOM's activation of functional component commands and recommendations in the 2006 QDR could signal a change in direction regarding the nature of the threat, including concerns about China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations posing potential nuclear or EMP attack threats. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and their impact on command and control systems are debated, with some advocating for reducing their role for non-proliferation efforts and others wanting to increase their utility against proliferators. The extent of the threat from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, whether from a nuclear strike or EMP attack, shapes the nuclear command and control system. The debate over the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and their impact on command and control systems continues, with differing views on reducing or increasing their utility. The architecture of the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is being questioned, particularly in light of additional requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and missile defense. Discussions and potential legislation may be needed to address these issues. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may need to incorporate additional 2001 NPR-driven command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and active missile defense. A debate and legislation regarding release authorities may precede architectural decisions. A dispersed approach like USSTRATCOM proposes could be more suitable for the current threat environment, potentially leading to manpower and budget savings in the long term. However, the application of a distributed, network-style approach to nuclear command and control remains untested. The level of investment in modernization or new procurement is uncertain. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are projected to continue for years into the future, with potential adjustments based on the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR findings. The retirement of the E-4B NAOC and MCCC could offer short-term savings as services look to recapitalize equipment. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are ongoing, with potential adjustments based on the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR findings. The retirement of the E-4B NAOC and MCCC may provide short-term savings. Questions arise about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as the value of their secondary uses. The NCCS, a national asset built up over decades, could potentially offer added value through ancillary functions. The NCCS, a national asset built up over decades, could potentially offer added value through ancillary functions such as homeland security missions and domestic disaster response. This raises questions about the justification for continued investment in these platforms and whether their procurement and operation should be transferred to civilian agencies."
