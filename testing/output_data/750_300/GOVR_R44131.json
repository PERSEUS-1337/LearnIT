Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report outlines the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to Congressional requests. The report details the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to a Congressional request. It summarizes changes in UCLASS and predecessor program requirements over time, starting in 1999 with research into unmanned combat air vehicles by the Navy and DARPA. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research on unmanned combat air vehicles. The Navy's UCAV project was designed for reconnaissance missions to identify targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman independently built a single X-47A air vehicle. The N-UCAV program focused on electronic attack and reconnaissance missions to identify targets for manned aircraft. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle tested under the program in February 2003. The Office of the Secretary of Defense mandated the Navy and Air Force merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program in 2003. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program in 2003, resulting in the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. This program aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility and military utility of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for missions such as SEAD, electronic attack, and precision strike. The J-UCAS program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. Despite its focus on combat situations in denied enemy territory, the program was terminated in 2006. The J-UCAS program aimed to operate in denied enemy territory but was terminated in 2006. The Navy then developed the N-UCAS for carrier-based operations with increased capabilities. The Navy developed the N-UCAS program to increase naval reach and persistence, with the goal of providing persistent surveillance and strike capability in high threat areas. In 2006, the Navy initiated the UCAS-D program to demonstrate the feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. In 2006, the Navy started the UCAS-D program under the N-UCAS initiative to show the feasibility of using unmanned air combat systems on aircraft carriers. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in UCAS-D, which successfully launched and landed on an aircraft carrier in 2013. This program was part of the larger effort to develop unmanned vehicles with capabilities similar to manned fighters. In 2011, the Navy began planning for the UCLASS acquisition program. In 2011, the Navy received approval from DOD to start planning for the UCLASS acquisition program, building on the success of the UCAS-D program. The goal was to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance the Navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments. The Navy received approval in 2011 to start planning for the UCLASS acquisition program, aiming to enhance sea-based surveillance capabilities in contested environments. JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document, defining it as a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. In 2012, JROC revised the UCLASS requirements through memoranda 086-12 and 196-12. The JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement for the FY2014 budget submission, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities over strike capability due to budget constraints. Dyke Weatherington, the Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare and ISR, attributed the reduction in strike capability to fiscal realities. \"The Navy's next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle's strike capability was reduced due to fiscal constraints, according to Dyke Weatherington, the Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare and ISR. JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of JROCM 087-11 to support affordability and adaptability directives, emphasizing the need for a platform that can handle various missions. The Office of the Secretary of Defense also highlighted the importance of a versatile platform in December 2012.\" The JROC emphasized affordability as the top priority for the next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle program. The Capability Development Document set a Key Performance Parameter for the air vehicles' cost not to exceed $150 million for one 600 nautical mile orbit. Limited funding pressures industry to provide mature systems and focus on cost. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for the UCLASS system on April 17, 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance while de-emphasizing the need to operate in highly contested environments. The draft RFP is classified. The UCLASS program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits over uncontested airspace 24/7, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The UCLASS program aims to provide 24/7 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The goal is to develop an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments. The UCLASS program aims to develop an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments, with the ability to expand its missions to include extended range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. The timeline for procurement is unclear, and ongoing delays have been noted due to changes in requirements. The UCLASS program aims to develop an autonomous aircraft with precision strike capabilities in contested environments, as well as extended range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. Delays in procurement have been ongoing due to changes in requirements, with the Navy now expecting a 3-year delay in the award of the air system contract to occur in fiscal year 2017. The Navy's UCLASS program has experienced delays, with the air system contract now expected to be awarded in fiscal year 2017, a 3-year delay. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. Milestone A review is also delayed to fiscal year 2017. The Navy's budget documents indicate a 3-year delay in the Milestone A review for the UCLASS program, now scheduled for fiscal year 2017. The program's timeline may further extend due to additional reviews and changes in DOD priorities."
