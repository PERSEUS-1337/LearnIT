The Act \"Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012\" allows the Secretary to designate a combination of drugs as significant if they have the potential to advance treatment for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Act allows the Secretary to designate drug combinations that have the potential to significantly advance treatment for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Act allows the Secretary to designate drug combinations that are not approved or licensed, with the purpose of encouraging their codevelopment. The Secretary can designate drug combinations not approved or licensed to encourage codevelopment, considering task force recommendations. The codevelopment task force recommendations under the Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012 allow drug manufacturers to request the Secretary to determine if a combination of drugs is significant within 30 days of submission. The Secretary will review a request for drug combination designation within 30 days and provide notice if the combination meets the requirements. The Secretary will provide notice to the person who submitted the request if a drug combination is deemed significant. If the combination meets the requirements but has not been previously designated, the Secretary will designate it as a significant drug combination. The Secretary designates drug combinations as significant if they meet requirements, providing notice to the submitter. If not meeting requirements, the Secretary does not designate them as significant.

The Secretary designates drug combinations as significant if they meet requirements, providing notice to the submitter. Requests for designation must be made concurrently with or after submitting an application for drug investigation. The deadline for designation is not later than the completion of phase I trials for any of the drugs involved in the combination. The Secretary designates significant drug combinations after phase I trials are completed. An initial list is published within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will develop and publish an initial list of significant drug combinations on the FDA website. This list will be updated annually to include new combinations and exclude previously designated ones. The Secretary will designate significant drug combinations and exclude those that no longer meet the requirements. Market exclusivity may be extended before drug approval. The Secretary designates significant drug combinations and may extend market exclusivity before drug approval, based on specific criteria.

The definition of 'significantly advance treatment' for drug combinations includes treating life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy available. The criteria for extending market exclusivity for drug combinations include treating life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy available or demonstrating improved effects on serious outcomes compared to alternative therapies. This can include superiority of the drug combination or minimizing the development of drug resistance. The criteria for extending market exclusivity for drug combinations include treating life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy available or demonstrating improved effects on serious outcomes compared to alternative therapies, such as the superiority of the drug combination or minimizing drug resistance development in active controlled trials assessing serious morbidity endpoints.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include drugs in significant combinations designated under section 505E(a) if intended for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. A Codevelopment Task Force is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an interagency task force within 6 months of this Act to promote codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations. The task force will include experts in research and drug development for serious diseases like cancer, and will be responsible for recommending a list of significant drug combinations. The task force under subsection (a) will focus on preclinical and clinical drug development for serious diseases like cancer. Its duties include recommending a list of significant drug combinations for designation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
