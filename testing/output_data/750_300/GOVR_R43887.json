Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse and neglect of older persons. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA). The Older Americans Act (OAA) contains seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Title V is administered by the Department of Labor's (DOL's) Employment and Training Administration. Funding for OAA Titles II, III, IV, VI, and VII is provided in annual HHS appropriations, while Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations. The Older Americans Act (OAA) contains seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Discretionary funding for OAA Titles II, III, IV, VI, and VII is provided in annual HHS appropriations, while Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006 authorizing appropriations through FY2011. The Older Americans Act (OAA) was last reauthorized in 2006, authorizing appropriations through FY2011. Despite the expiration of authorizations, Congress has continued to fund OAA programs. This report discusses OAA funding, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding for programs, funding history since FY2001, and legislative activity for FY2015 appropriations. The report provides an overview of OAA's FY2015 funding, including a detailed breakdown of current-year funding for programs and activities. It also reviews OAA's funding history since FY2001, summarizes FY2015 legislative activity for appropriations, and discusses funding decisions for selected OAA programs. Appendixes offer more detailed funding information and history. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, which is $6.5 million (0.3%) more than FY2014 funding. Appendix A shows authorizations of appropriations for each title of the act as stipulated by the 2006 Older Americans Act Amendments. Appendix B provides funding levels for OAA programs from FY2006 through FY2015. For more information about the Older Americans Act, see CRS Report R43414. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) allocated $1.878 billion for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the majority of funding (70.7%), focusing on nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of the funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to AOA-administered activities under Title II (2.7%). In FY2015, $1.878 billion was allocated for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs, with 70.7% of funding going towards nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of the funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to AOA-administered activities under Titles II (2.7%), IV (0.7%), grants to Native Americans under Title VI (1.7%), and vulnerable elder rights protection activities under Title VII (1.1%). Two exceptions included new FY2015 funding of $2.5 million for supportive services for Holocaust survivors under Title IV. In FY2015, OAA programs received the same funding as in FY2014, except for $2.5 million for supportive services for Holocaust survivors and $4.0 million for an Elder Justice Initiative. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs slightly increased from FY2001 to FY2002 and remained flat through FY2006. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002 and remained relatively flat through FY2006. Annual increases in OAA program funding occurred from FY2006 to FY2010, with funding levels remaining below FY2010 levels since then. OAA funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, representing a 31% increase over this period. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, a 31% increase over this period. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. The reduction in FY2013 is mainly due to sequestration. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, a 31% increase. Funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. The reduction in FY2013 is mainly due to sequestration. FY2014 and FY2015 funding was slightly below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, combining aging and disability services programs. In FY2014 and FY2015, funding for OAA Title II \"Program Administration\" now includes aging and disability services programs administered by ACL. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (P.L. 113-164) provided temporary government-wide funding through December 17, 2014 for discretionary Labor-HHS-Education programs. Funding was continued through three CRs with a 0.0554% reduction from FY2014 levels. No markup was held for FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education funding. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations. However, a bill introduced in September 2014 would have provided increased funding for OAA Title V and senior nutrition programs compared to FY2014 levels. The bill proposed increased funding for OAA Title V and senior nutrition programs in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015. It allocated $448.3 million for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and $816 million for OAA Title III senior nutrition programs, restoring funding to FY2012 levels. The bill did not specify funding for other OAA programs and activities. It was referred to the House Appropriations Committee but did not progress further. On June 10, 2014, the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels. The bill proposed increases in family caregiver funding and a decrease in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels. The bill proposed a $5.5 million increase in family caregiver funding and a $5.9 million decrease in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, $52.5 million less than the FY2014 funding level. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with most programs funded at FY2014 levels. Exceptions included $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference. The FY2015 budget requested $25.0 million for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" and proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. Differences in funding for selected OAA programs and issues were highlighted among various FY2015 budget proposals and final funding enacted under P.L. 113-235. The FY2015 budget included funding for the CSEOA program, Holocaust survivors' support, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. CSEOA provides part-time community service opportunities for low-income individuals aged 55 and older with poor job prospects. The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) was established to provide part-time community service opportunities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older with poor job prospects. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring program administration to ACL and reducing funding by 13% to $380.0 million. 17 out of 56 state and territorial grantees operate CSEOA programs in state labor departments. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring program administration of the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) to ACL, with a funding reduction of 13% to $380.0 million. 17 out of 56 state and territorial grantees operate CSEOA programs in state labor departments, while the rest are in aging, senior services, or health and human services departments. The transfer to ACL aims to consolidate Federal oversight under one department, streamlining operations and aligning Federal administration with program goals. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring program administration of the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) to ACL, with a funding reduction of 13% to $380.0 million. The transfer to ACL aims to consolidate Federal oversight under one department, streamlining operations and aligning Federal administration with program goals. This transfer would require legislation from Congress to take effect. If placed in HHS, ACL would target the program to persons with the greatest need and consider \"all sources of income\" in determining eligibility for future enrollees. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring program administration of the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) to ACL, with a funding reduction of 13% to $380.0 million. ACL would target the program to persons with the greatest need, consider \"all sources of income\" for eligibility, and restructure CSEOA as a community service program separate from the Workforce Investment Act framework. The CSEOA program was previously administered alongside Workforce Investment Act programs but was found not to fit well within that framework. The Senate bill proposed funding CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while H.R. 5464 suggested funding it under the DOL account at $448.3 million. The subcommittee recommended keeping CSEOA in DOL, aligning with previous recommendations in Labor-HHS-Education committee reports from FY2012 to FY2014. The CSEOA program remains funded and administered under DOL for FY2015 with the same appropriations as in FY2014, with a provision for the Secretary of Labor to reserve 0.5% of the funding for program evaluation. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors are estimated to be beneficiaries of the program. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million in OAA Title IV funding to establish a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, which would provide supportive services for Holocaust survivors living in poverty. The Fund would also receive matching dollars from private philanthropy for services like legal assistance and case management. The Senate bill did not propose funding for the Holocaust Survivor program. The Senate bill and H.R. 5464 did not specify funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding to provide supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. The FY2015 final funding did not establish the proposed Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund in H.R. 5464, but it included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) aim to provide a single entry point for information on long-term services and supports, including counseling, access to public programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) offer counseling on long-term services and supports, access to public programs like Medicaid, and discharge planning services to help individuals stay in their homes after hospitalization. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide, with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. ADRCs received $10 million in funding from FY2010 to FY2014 under the ACA. ADRCs operate in 50 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia, with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. They received $10 million in mandatory funding from FY2010 to FY2014 under the ACA. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding for ADRCs but suggested $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The budget justification highlighted the history of funding for ADRCs, with $100 million provided since 2003 to develop infrastructure. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged ACL to improve coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs under the Medicaid Balancing Incentive Payments Program, urging improved coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs for consumer access to long-term services and supports. Final FY2015-enacted funding also provided $6.1 million to ADRCs, not meeting the President's budget request for additional mandatory funding. The FY2015-enacted funding for ADRCs remained at $6.1 million in discretionary funding, failing to meet the President's request for additional mandatory funding. The White House Conferences on Aging have historically addressed concerns of older individuals and guided federal policymakers, with the first conference held in 1961. The National Conference on Aging in 1950 was the precursor to the White House Conferences on Aging, which have been held in every decade since 1961. The President's FY2015 budget proposed funding for a conference in 2015, but the Senate bill did not allocate dedicated funding, suggesting support from existing resources. The House Conference on Aging in 2015 did not receive dedicated funding from the Senate bill due to budget constraints. H.R. 5464 and final FY2015 appropriations also did not specify funding for the White House Conference on Aging. The White House plans to hold the conference in 2015 in Washington, DC, but without direct appropriations, the scale and scope of the conference will be different from previous ones. The White House plans to hold the 2015 Conference on Aging in Washington, DC. The conference will utilize technology to engage more people and will focus on key policy areas such as retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions have also been announced. The 2015 Conference on Aging in Washington, DC will focus on key policy areas including retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov.
