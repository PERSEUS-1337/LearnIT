    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that funding levels for a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan may need to be 33% higher than Navy's plans. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates in recent years, causing concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. The Navy has been forced to reduce ship procurement rates due to rising ship-procurement costs, causing concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Congress must decide how to address these cost increases, which could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing annual ship-procurement funding and changing procurement processes. Options for responding to rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing annual Navy ship-procurement funding, changing funding methods, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, and building ships without some planned equipment. One option to reduce Navy ship procurement costs is to shift to designs with lower unit procurement costs, in addition to other cost-saving measures such as reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs and building ships in foreign shipyards. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs, particularly if other cost-saving measures are not implemented or prove insufficient. It discusses notional options for lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants, along with potential advantages and disadvantages of shifting to lower-cost designs. Lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants have been proposed in recent reports on the future of the Navy by various organizations. The section discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of shifting to these designs, along with recent legislative activity relating to rising Navy ship procurement costs. Lower-cost ship designs for the Navy have been proposed in recent reports by various organizations. One strategy to reduce procurement cost is by reducing ship size, as seen in the case of the Littoral Combat Ship. This approach can be applied to other types of ships as well. Reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion are strategies to lower procurement costs for Navy ships. The Littoral Combat Ship serves as an example of the former strategy, while submarines and aircraft carriers could potentially benefit from the latter. Equipping Navy ships with conventional propulsion instead of nuclear can significantly reduce procurement costs by several hundred million dollars. Shifting to a hull built to commercial-ship survivability standards, rather than military standards, can also lower construction expenses. The Navy is exploring these cost-saving measures for its future shipbuilding plans. The Navy is considering building ships with commercial-like hulls to reduce costs and is exploring using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to benefit from improved production economies of scale. The Navy is exploring using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and benefit from improved production economies of scale. This strategy could be applied to various types of ships, including destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, missile-and-rocket ships, amphibious assault ships, and small-craft \"mother\" ships. The idea is to use a merchant-like hull design for these ships to streamline production and save costs. The Navy is considering using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships - an aircraft carrier, a missile-and-rocket ship, an amphibious assault ship, and a small-craft \"mother\" ship - with a common merchant-like hull. The CSBA report proposes using the hull design of the Navy's LPD-17 class amphibious ship for other ship types. Lower-cost ship options based on these approaches may be less capable than current designs but offer cost savings. The report discusses potential lower-cost ship designs derived from current designs, highlighting that they may be less capable individually. The current design mentioned is the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine, with potential lower-cost options being AIP-equipped. The final section of the report evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of shifting to these lower-cost designs. The report discusses potential lower-cost ship designs derived from current designs, focusing on the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine. The Navy is currently procuring one submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. The FY2007-FY2011 Future Years Defense Plan maintains procurement at one per year through FY2011, with a proposed fleet size of 313 ships. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 attack submarines (SSNs), with procurement of one Virginia-class submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion. To support the planned force of 48 SSNs, 35 boats may need to be procured from FY2007-FY2022, averaging 2.2 boats per year. Continuing at one per year beyond FY2011 could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The Navy's plan to maintain a fleet of 313 ships includes 48 attack submarines (SSNs), with procurement of one Virginia-class submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion. To support the planned force of 48 SSNs, 35 boats may need to be procured from FY2007-FY2022, averaging 2.2 boats per year. Continuing at one per year beyond FY2011 could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. Options for lower-cost attack submarines include non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion systems or reduced-cost SSNs using new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. The Navy's plan includes procuring non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion systems or reduced-cost SSNs using new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies developed by the Navy and DARPA. These submarines are less expensive and smaller than nuclear-powered submarines, with AIP systems like fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engines to extend submerged endurance. The Navy's plan includes procuring air-independent propulsion (AIP)-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines to complement the existing fleet of Virginia-class boats. The OFT report suggests acquiring AIP submarines alongside Virginia-class boats, potentially substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups. The Navy plans to procure air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The OFT report recommends acquiring four AIP submarines for the cost of one Virginia-class submarine, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million each. The Navy plans to procure AIP submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The estimated unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine is $600 million to $750 million each. A U.S. Navy AIP submarine might cost more due to higher capability standards, possibly reducing the equal-cost ratio of substitution. New technologies are available for the Virginia class designed in the early to mid-1990s. The Navy is exploring the possibility of developing a new, less expensive SSN design through the Tango Bravo program, which aims to leverage emerging technologies. This new design could potentially offer similar capabilities to the existing Virginia-class submarines at a lower procurement cost. The Navy and DARPA are developing technologies under the Tango Bravo program to enable design options for a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the VIRGINIA Class design. The goal is to reduce platform infrastructure, lower costs, and increase payload volume by overcoming selected technology barriers. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy aims to overcome technology barriers impacting submarine platform infrastructure cost. Technical objectives include shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to spherical arrays, simplifying existing systems, and automation to reduce crew workload. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy aims to develop technologies such as shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to existing arrays, simplifying submarine systems, and automation to reduce crew workload. These technologies could potentially lead to the design of a new submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost, making it more feasible to procure at a rate of two per year. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost is being considered as an alternative to procuring AIP submarines. This submarine could be procured at a rate of two per year, allowing for continued Virginia-class procurement until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN with capabilities similar to the Virginia class is being considered as an alternative to procuring AIP submarines. Virginia-class procurement could continue at one per year until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement. The first Tango Bravo submarine might be ready for procurement in a few years. Potential lower-cost options include a medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on LHA(R) amphibious assault ship design. The Navy is currently building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. Potential lower-cost options for carriers include medium-sized, conventionally powered carriers based on LHA(R) amphibious assault ship design, commercial-like hull design, and small carriers based on high-speed surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull design. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) is an example of a large nuclear-powered carrier. The Navy is constructing large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $4.975 billion, but construction costs have since risen to about $6.1 billion. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is part of the new CVN-21 class and is scheduled to be procured in FY2008. The Navy is constructing large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $6.1 billion. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, part of the new CVN-21 class, is scheduled to be procured in FY2008 at an estimated cost of $10.5 billion. The Navy is constructing large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. CVN-78 is planned for procurement in FY2008 at a cost of $10.5 billion. The next carrier, CVN-79, is planned for procurement in FY2012, with a potential service entry around 2019. CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. Lower-cost options include a medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carrier based on the design for the LHA Replacement ship currently being developed by the Navy. The Navy is considering options for designing medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carriers based on different hull designs. The CSBA report recommends procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. The CSBA report recommends procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. Additionally, it suggests acquiring four medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design, with a unit cost of around $3 billion. The OFT report recommends procuring a medium-sized carrier based on a commercial-like hull design for about $3 billion. This carrier would carry 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and 15 UAVs, with a full load displacement of 57,000 tons. The OFT report recommends procuring a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of 57,000 tons, carrying 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and 15 UAVs. This ship would be larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The report suggests substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Alternatively, the report recommends procuring a small carrier as an alternative. The OFT report recommended replacing two 57,000-ton carriers with the Navy's large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. An alternative suggested was a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull, designed for UAV/UCAV operations. The OFT report recommended developing a high-speed unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UAV/UCAV) carrier with a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, capable of speeds between 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended developing a high-speed unmanned combat aerial vehicle carrier with a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, capable of speeds between 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT-recommended ship would be much faster than other existing carriers. Studies have discussed various potential designs for aircraft carriers, including a large conventionally powered carrier. Studies have discussed potential designs for aircraft carriers, including a large conventionally powered carrier that might displace about 100,000 tons and have a procurement cost lower than a nuclear-powered carrier. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design might cost more than $3 billion, displacing about 40,000 tons and embarking two dozen VSTOL JSFs. A nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) design could cost over $3 billion, displacing around 40,000 tons and carrying about two dozen VSTOL JSFs. It would be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle, which displaces 42,000 tons and carries an air wing of 34 CTOL airplanes and two helicopters. Additionally, a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots was developed by the Naval War College in 2000. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft. The curr_chunk discusses various options for aircraft carriers, including large nuclear-powered carriers, medium-sized carriers capable of operating VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, and small carriers limited to VSTOL aircraft. It mentions the possibility of small conventionally powered carriers with commercial-like hulls and small nuclear-powered carriers. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975 with displacements ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. While the table does not provide examples of small nuclear-powered carriers or ships combining nuclear propulsion with a commercial-like hull, such possibilities exist. The Navy procured nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975. The current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser. Potential lower-cost options are the 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD), 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)), and low-cost gunfire support ship. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers starting in FY2011. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers starting in FY2011. The CG(X) cruiser would be based on the DDG-1000 design, larger, and more expensive. The DDG-1000 has a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it 50% larger than the Navy's current 9,000-ton Aegis. The DDG-1000 destroyers are planned to be procured in FY2007 with a full-load displacement of 14,500 tons, making them larger than current Navy cruisers and destroyers. The first two ships are estimated to cost $3.3 billion each, with the following ships averaging $2.5 billion each. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers, with the first two costing $3.3 billion each and the following ships averaging $2.5 billion each. There are concerns that procurement costs may be higher than estimated. Originally planning for 16-24 DDG-1000s, the Navy now plans to procure a total of 7 as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, which also includes 19 CG(X)s. Planned DDG-1000 procurement has been reduced to one per year in the FY2006-FY2011 FYDP. The Navy originally planned to procure 16-24 DDG-1000 destroyers but now intends to acquire only 7 as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year. Options for a lower-cost surface combatant include a cruiser-destroyer, frigate, and gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant in the period FY2007-FY2011 include a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, roughly 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design and larger than today's Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. This ship, possibly called the smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD), could replace the CG(X) program or both. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could be a cost-effective replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate advanced technologies, have a reduced crew size, and lower operation costs compared to current designs. The SCD could be a cost-effective replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would have a reduced crew size and lower operation costs compared to current designs, carrying a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but greater than current Ticonderoga Aegis cruisers or DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers. The SCD could potentially replace the CG(X) program, DDG-1000, and CG(X) programs with reduced crew size and operation costs. It could carry two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) like the DDG-1000, or preserve CG(X) radar capabilities for air and missile defense. Another option suggested is a smaller, less expensive frigate known as the FFG(X) that might displace about 6,000 tons. The FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the DDG-1000/CG(X) and LCS programs, estimated to displace 6,000 tons with a unit cost of $800 million. It may not be equipped with the AGS but can perform non-gunfire missions like the DDG-1000 and LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the DDG-1000 and LCS programs, capable of performing non-gunfire missions. It would fill the gap between the 4,000-ton FFG-7 and 9,000-ton DD-963 designs, carrying modern mission equipment. A smaller, less expensive new-design ship option is suggested, based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship, with one or two AGSs placed on the hull design. This option would have a different displacement compared to the LPD-17s currently under construction. The LPD-17 hull design is being considered for a new ship option with one or two AGSs, which may have a different displacement compared to current LPD-17s under construction. The estimated cost for an initial AGS-armed LPD-17 is about $1.9 billion, with subsequent ships costing around $1.5 billion each. The Navy's proposed 313-ship fleet includes DDG-1000 destroyers, CG(X) cruisers, and other surface combatant options. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its 313-ship fleet. These ships are small, fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The Navy aims to keep the procurement cost of each LCS sea frame under $220 million. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) with a goal of keeping the procurement cost of each sea frame under $220 million. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP suggests the average ship procurement cost, including mission modules, could be around $387 million. The OFT report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant instead of the LCS. The OFT report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with a total acquisition cost of about $22.1 billion. This ship would have a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots, standard interfaces for mission packages, and self-deploy to the theater of operations. Alternatively, a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots was also suggested. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting modular mission packages. These ships would be transported to the theater by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The 100-ton surface combatants would be supported in theater by the mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting modular mission packages. These ships would be supported in theater by a mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. Potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and potential impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. While the designs outlined in the previous section aim for lower unit procurement costs, a comprehensive cost assessment should consider development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Developing a large Navy ship can cost billions, and switching to a new, lower-cost design may save money in the long run, despite incurring additional development costs initially. Switching to a new, lower-cost ship design may save money in the long run, but stopping a current ship program for this purpose could result in additional development costs. The decision to switch designs should be based on reaching the financial break-even point by procuring the lower-cost design in large enough numbers to offset the upfront costs. Switching to a lower-cost ship design may save money in the long run by reaching the break-even point sooner. Utilizing existing technologies can further reduce development costs through the learning curve process, where shipyard labor hours decrease with more ships built. By utilizing existing technologies and the learning curve process, the cost to develop a new ship design can be significantly reduced. As shipyard workers become more familiar with the design, the number of labor hours required decreases. This means that switching to a lower-cost design may reach the break-even point sooner, especially if some ships have already been built to the current design. Switching to a lower-cost ship design can reduce development costs and reach the break-even point sooner if some ships have already been built to the current design. If the lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate, it can benefit from spreading fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly. Switching to a lower-cost ship design can reduce development costs and reach the break-even point sooner if some ships have already been built to the current design. If the lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate, it can benefit from spreading fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly. Navy ships are expensive to operate and support, with long service lives ranging from 20 to 50 years. Ship procurement costs are visible in the budget, but ship O&S costs are also significant. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost is crucial as it can contribute as much as, or even more than, its procurement cost to total long-term Navy expenditures. This can involve including design features that increase procurement cost and automating functions to reduce crew size, which is a major component of ship O&S costs. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost involves including design features that increase procurement cost and automating functions to reduce crew size. Technology can automate functions like damage control, traditionally performed by larger crews, but adding technology may increase the ship's procurement cost if it exceeds the savings from reducing crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs are another significant component of ship O&S costs, and reducing these costs may require building certain ship parts differently. Adding technology to automate functions on a ship can increase procurement costs, as it may require building certain parts with more expensive materials or increasing the size of spaces for easier maintenance access. An alternative ship design with lower procurement costs may actually have higher life-cycle O&S costs due to incorporating features that increase maintenance expenses. An alternative ship design with lower procurement costs may have higher life-cycle O&S costs due to features that increase maintenance expenses, such as fuel costs for conventionally powered ships and nuclear fuel core for nuclear-powered ships. The O&S cost of a conventionally powered ship includes fuel costs over its life, while for nuclear-powered ships, the procurement cost includes the nuclear fuel core. In 2004, the core for a nuclear-powered attack submarine cost $158 million and is designed for its 33-year life, while for a carrier, it cost $300 million for half of its 50-year life. This makes nuclear-powered ships more expensive to procure. The core for a nuclear-powered carrier in 2004 cost about $300 million and is designed to power the ship for half of its 50-year expected life. This means that while a nuclear-powered submarine or carrier is more expensive to procure initially, the nuclear-powered submarine will have no fuel-related O&S costs over its lifetime. When comparing nuclear-powered and conventionally powered carriers, the difference in accounting for fuel costs results in a smaller overall cost difference when procurement and life-cycle O&S costs are considered. The cost of a nuclear-powered carrier's second core may be less than the fuel costs of a conventionally powered carrier over its lifetime, especially if oil prices are high. The cost-effectiveness of nuclear power for ships depends on the price of oil, with higher oil prices making nuclear power more competitive. The total ownership cost of a nuclear-powered carrier's second core may be lower than the fuel costs of a conventionally powered carrier over its lifetime. In theory, nuclear-powered ships may have lower total ownership costs compared to conventionally powered ships, especially if the cost of oil is high. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and transport the reactor compartment to a storage area. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to defueling, cutting out, and sealing the reactor compartment for transport to a storage area. Costs range from $30 million to $570 million depending on the vessel type. Lower-cost ship designs may sacrifice some capabilities compared to higher-cost counterparts, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which could match the Virginia-class design in capability. Lower-cost ship designs may be less capable than higher-cost counterparts, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which could match the Virginia-class design in capability. Ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and value of ship numbers are key aspects to consider. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload tends to decrease as well. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload tends to decrease as well, impacting ship mobility and survivability. Smaller ships may not only be less capable than larger ones but also proportionately less capable due to factors like propulsion efficiency. The size of a ship impacts its capabilities, with smaller ships being less capable than larger ones. As ship size increases, the propulsion plant size increases less than proportionately, leaving more room for payload. For example, a 40,000-ton carrier is about 40% as large as a 100,000-ton carrier but can carry a smaller air wing. The size of an aircraft carrier impacts the total weight of embarked aircraft. A 40,000-ton carrier is 40% as large as a 100,000-ton carrier but can carry a smaller air wing. Transferring the air wing to a larger carrier can increase sortie generation due to the larger flight deck and capacity. When an air wing is transferred to a larger carrier, it can generate more sorties per day due to the larger flight deck and greater capacities. A carrier smaller than a certain size may not be able to operate certain aircraft or systems. Reducing ship size can limit the equipment that can be installed, such as CTOL aircraft on carriers or large radars on surface combatants. As ship size decreases, the cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase if total fleet payload is held constant. The total cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase as ship size decreases, if total fleet payload is held constant. This can also impact total fleet operation and support costs if crew size and fuel consumption do not decrease proportionately with ship size. The OFT report suggests that new technologies could help mitigate these effects for recommended smaller surface combatants. The OFT report argues that new technologies could allow for greater payload fraction on smaller surface combatants, as improvements in precision-guidance technology for weapons enable weapon size reduction without compromising damage capability. This could lead to reduced payload related to weapons and launchers without sacrificing effectiveness. The report suggests that advancements in precision-guidance technology could allow for smaller warheads to deliver the same damage as larger warheads. This could lead to a reduction in weapon size and payload on ships without compromising their capability. Additionally, improvements in sensor technology could also result in a decrease in weight and volume of sensors on ships. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. Larger ships built to military survivability standards are better equipped to withstand hits and continue operations after being attacked. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. On the other hand, supporters of smaller ships believe that a fleet composed of a large number of small ships could overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities and enhance overall fleet survivability. Supporters of smaller ships argue that concentrating too much capability in a small number of large ships may reduce overall fleet survivability. They suggest that a larger number of smaller ships could provide better fleet survivability and prevent the risk of losing expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes ship mobility and the types of operations it can undertake. Without nuclear power, submarines are considered submersibles for limited periods. Equipping a submarine with nuclear power changes its mobility and operational capabilities. Supporters of nuclear-powered submarines argue that without nuclear power, submarines are simply submersibles that operate below the surface for limited periods. AIP systems like fuel cells or closed-cycle diesel engines can also extend the submerged endurance of non-nuclear-powered submarines. An AIP system, such as a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine, can significantly extend the stationary or low-speed submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine to up to two or three weeks. However, it does not increase the high-speed submerged endurance, which remains at 1 to 3 hours for both conventional diesel-electric and AIP-equipped submarines. A non-nuclear-powered submarine's high-speed submerged endurance is limited by battery capacity, typically lasting 1 to 3 hours. In contrast, a nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged for weeks or months, with endurance limited by food supply. Non-nuclear-powered submarines have limited high-speed submerged endurance due to battery capacity, lasting only 1 to 3 hours. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months, limited by food supply. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to the theater of operations on a transport ship, acknowledging that their presence may become known. In contrast, having an SSN in a carrier strike group can be a force multiplier. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship to the theater of operations, acknowledging that their presence may become known. On the other hand, having an SSN in a carrier strike group can be a force multiplier by allowing it to be detached and redirected to a different theater without alerting others, creating uncertainty for opposing forces. This enables the SSN to achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The presence of an SSN in a carrier strike group can create uncertainty for opposing forces, allowing it to achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine would depend on the operations it needs to perform while part of a forward-deployed carrier strike group. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group depends on its operational needs. Nuclear-powered carriers can respond quickly to crises without refueling, allowing immediate combat operations upon arrival. The AIP submarines do not need to refuel upon arriving at the area of operations, allowing immediate combat operations. They can sustain combat operations for longer periods before needing resupply. Advocates of higher-speed ships like the LCS argue that their increased capability to shift locations rapidly and evade enemy tracking justifies their higher speeds. Skeptics question the proven benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Supporters of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that more ships allow for broader coverage and presence. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that a fleet with more ships can maintain a day-to-day presence in multiple locations or respond to simultaneous crises more effectively. They suggest that a fleet of less-capable ships offers more flexibility in deploying naval capability. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that a fleet with more ships can maintain a day-to-day presence in multiple locations or respond to simultaneous crises more effectively. They suggest that a fleet of less-capable ships offers more flexibility in deploying naval capability, as the force's capability grows with the number of nodes in the network. The theory of network-centric warfare suggests that the force's capability increases with the number of nodes in the network, such as ships, aircraft, and sensors. Advocates argue that a larger fleet with more ships can effectively respond to multiple crises and maintain a presence in various locations. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that forces should shift to more distributed force designs. They believe that a smaller number of expensive ships may limit the fleet's capabilities and that current ship designs already offer flexibility for naval operations. Advocates of a larger fleet argue for more distributed force designs, emphasizing the need for increased fleet deployment flexibility. They suggest that current ship designs already offer sufficient capability for various naval situations, even with a smaller number of more expensive ships. Advocates of a larger fleet argue for more distributed force designs, emphasizing the need for increased fleet deployment flexibility. Even with a smaller number of more expensive ships, a fleet would still have an adequate number of nodes for network-centric warfare. Lower-cost options that may pose technical risks for the Navy include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants due to new technologies. Homeporting smaller ships offers more flexibility due to limitations in berthing spaces and water depth. Homeporting nuclear-powered carriers or submarines is more complex than conventional ships due to unique requirements. Homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier or submarine can be more complex than conventional ships due to unique requirements, such as access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country can be politically challenging, especially if the ship is nuclear-powered and there are anti-nuclear sentiments in the host country. Lower-cost ship designs may impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work, especially if the ship is nuclear-powered and there are anti-nuclear sentiments in the host country. The total volume of Navy shipbuilding work depends on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. The shift to lower-cost ship designs may impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work, depending on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leads to no substantial change in shipbuilding work volume, using lower-cost designs to reduce total shipbuilding costs, or altering the total number of ships built. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact Navy shipbuilding work volume based on funding availability. Three scenarios include maintaining work volume, reducing costs, or increasing funding for more ships. The lower-cost ship designs in this report could impact Navy shipbuilding work volume by increasing funding for more ships, potentially affecting the distribution of shipbuilding work among various shipyards. The construction of AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines could involve General Dynamics' Electric Boat (GD/EB), Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN), or non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls shipyard at Pascagoula, MS. The division of work between the shipyards may differ from the current distribution for building Virginia-class submarines. AIP-equipped non-nuclear submarines could be built by GD/EB, NGNN, or non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls. Procuring AIP submarines instead of nuclear ones may impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the sole U.S. yard capable of constructing large nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers rely on work from the Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. Other yards like Ingalls could potentially build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. A medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on a merchant-like hull could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, Avondale shipyard, or GD/NASSCO. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design might be built at various shipyards with experience in SES/catamaran hulls. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design could be built at shipyards with experience in SES/catamaran hulls. Procuring conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones may reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. The Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs provide significant work to manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant equals five submarine plants. DDG-1000 destroyers are built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Smaller surface combatants like a 11,000-ton SCD or a 6,000-ton FFG(X) could also be built at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. Division of work between yards may vary from the DDG-1000 program. The support ship could be built at NGSS, GD/BIW, Avondale, or NGNN. LCS versions are to be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. A 1,000- or 100-ton surface combatant could be built at these yards or others focusing on smaller ships. H.R. 5122 would limit procurement costs of CVN-21 class. The Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, AL could build a 1,000- or 100-ton surface combatant, along with other yards specializing in smaller ships. H.R. 5122 limits procurement costs for various classes of ships to current Navy estimates, with adjustments for inflation. Section 1014 establishes a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about rising costs and production schedules of major defense programs. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about rising costs and production schedules of major defense programs, leading to an over-reliance on expensive and time-consuming ''mega'' systems. Section 1014 aims to establish a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the over-reliance on expensive and time-consuming ''mega'' systems in major defense programs, leading to rising costs and production schedules. This situation creates a ''high demand, low density'' scenario where needed platforms have higher operational tempos, wear out faster, and limit the strategic depth of United States forces. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the over-reliance on expensive and time-consuming ''mega'' systems in major defense programs, leading to rising costs and production schedules. This situation creates a ''high demand, low density'' scenario where needed platforms wear out faster, increase stress on military personnel, and limit the strategic depth of United States forces. The committee applauds the Chief of Naval Operations for developing the Navy's future force structure and long-term shipbuilding plan, but is concerned about the plan's affordability and development using unrealistic assumptions. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan, which requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds. Obtaining these additional funds during a period of anticipated federal spending reductions will be challenging. The Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan requires a significant increase in funds, which may be challenging to obtain during anticipated federal spending reductions. The plan also relies on ship acquisition programs avoiding cost growth, raising concerns about affordability and the future of naval shipbuilding. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan and the excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. They are concerned about the process used for establishing the Navy's ship cost estimates. The committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting that they have been inaccurate and unrealistic for existing ship classes. In some cases, known shipbuilding costs were excluded from the estimates, making them inaccurate from the start. The committee recommends revising the process for ship cost estimates to include all major known elements and notes that cost limitations are proposed for three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships to ensure accuracy. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships by July 1, 2006, for review and approval by the Under Secretary of Defense. The Secretary must submit a report to congressional defense committees with certified cost estimates including all major elements. The Secretary of the Navy must submit revalidated cost estimates for ship classes to congressional defense committees by July 1, 2006. The report includes a certification that all known and anticipated major cost elements are included. The DDG-1000 program is deemed unaffordable by the committee, with the Navy reducing the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to stay within budget. The Navy's plan to build two lead ships for the $6.6 billion budget is not feasible. Originally proposing 32 next-generation destroyers, the number was reduced to 24, then to 7 to make the program affordable. The committee doubts that the original requirements for the next-generation destroyer can be met with such a small number. They suggest reducing the requirements for the DD(X) to procure a smaller, less expensive destroyer in greater numbers. The committee does not believe that enough DD(X) ships will be procured to meet operational needs. They support the construction of up to two ships. The committee doubts the feasibility of the Navy's plan to build two lead ships for the $6.6 billion budget. They suggest reducing the requirements for the DD(X) to procure a smaller, less expensive destroyer in greater numbers. The committee does not believe that enough DD(X) ships will be procured to meet operational needs and supports the construction of up to two ships to demonstrate technologies for future major surface combatants. The budget request contained no funds for the maritime technology program. The committee questions the Navy's plan to build two lead ships for $6.6 billion and suggests reducing requirements for the DD(X) program. They doubt enough ships will be procured to meet operational needs and support building up to two ships to showcase future technologies. The budget request did not include funds for the maritime technology program aimed at improving Navy shipbuilding efficiency. The committee supports Navy's efforts to lower construction costs in ship procurements through recapitalization contract incentives. They encourage expanding these efforts to all ship procurements, including the Lewis and Clark (T-AKE) class program. The committee includes a provision (section 1014) to create incentives for improvements in sequencing and build processes. The committee supports efforts to lower construction costs in ship procurements by creating incentives for improvements in sequencing and build processes. They also propose a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness enhancements in Navy ship procurement. The committee supports efforts to lower construction costs in ship procurements by creating incentives for improvements in sequencing and build processes. Authorities granted to the Navy will allow for greater collaboration with shipbuilders to identify and finance process changes, equipment investments, and facilities improvements to reduce costs. This will lead to savings in ship construction, enhance the competitiveness of U.S. shipyards, and improve the shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base. The committee recommends allocating $120.0 million for these initiatives. The committee recommends allocating $120.0 million for the maritime technology program and enhancing the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base. They also support the national shipbuilding research program to improve efficiency in the United States shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP), which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. NSRP aims to improve efficiency in the United States shipbuilding industry, with a conservative estimate of a five to one return on investment. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and modernizing infrastructure for naval vessel construction. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and modernizing infrastructure for naval vessel construction. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to support U.S. shipyards in enhancing efficiency and competitiveness. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for long-lead components for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concern about the high costs and low shipbuilding rates driving a downward spiral in shipbuilding. Stable ship requirements, increased funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships are seen as crucial to reversing this trend. The committee emphasizes stable ship requirements, increased shipbuilding budget funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships as essential to reversing the downward trend in shipbuilding. Concerns were raised about cost growth in the CVN-77 program and the need to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings in the CVN-21 class program through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity procurement. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings in the CVN-21 class program through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity procurement, with a recommended increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class, with an increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for CVN-21 class vessels is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the report. The report states that the procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to escalation impacts, increased labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. Additional funding of $348.4 million was included in the fiscal year 2007 budget request for CVN-77 cost growth. The Navy's CVN-77 procurement cost has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors, including escalation impacts, increased labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. The fiscal year 2007 budget request included $348.4 million for cost growth, with additional funding to be requested in the future. Management actions have been taken to contain costs, such as deferring non-essential upgrades, minimizing contract change orders, implementing a Lean Six-Sigma program, and revising the schedule for more efficient completion. The committee remains concerned about the cost containment efforts. The Navy's CVN-77 procurement cost has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors, including escalation impacts, increased labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. Despite management actions taken to contain costs, the Navy is projecting CVN-77 cost to grow to the contract ceiling, in excess of 30 percent above the baseline cost cap. The Secretary's report to Congress on the long-range plan for construction of naval vessels establishes cost estimates for future ship construction, targeting improved performance based on ongoing efforts to control CVN-77. The Secretary's report to Congress on the long-range plan for construction of naval vessels establishes cost estimates for future ship construction, targeting improved performance based on management actions similar to ongoing efforts to control CVN-77 cost. Improved visibility into completion cost performance is necessary to assess the effectiveness of these actions and determine further steps to improve affordability of the future force. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a report for this purpose. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a quarterly report to congressional defense committees regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, end of period actual costs, and percent progress. The report also addresses the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. The report highlights cost risks in constructing lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. Emphasizing cost control, the Navy should pursue competition, commonality, and learning curve results in procuring this 55-ship class. The LCS is seen as vital for the Navy's global war on terror strategy. The committee supports the Navy's strategy for the global war on terror and the rapid fielding of the LCS. However, they are concerned about cost growth overtaking affordability in the LCS program. The committee supports the Navy's strategy for the global war on terror and the rapid fielding of the LCS. However, they are concerned about cost growth overtaking affordability in the program, with a lack of clear acquisition strategy and assessment of added costs for training, maintenance, and procurement of LCS vessels. The Navy has not assessed the added costs for training, maintenance, and procurement of LCS vessels. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006, outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, and cost containment strategy. The Navy is directed to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006, detailing the acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, and cost containment strategy. The report should also include all R&D and procurement costs for the program, as well as assess the added life cycle costs for two different LCS designs. Shipyard costs and efficiency are also addressed in the report. The report on the LCS program details shipyard costs and efficiency, highlighting the positive impact of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) collaboration between the Navy and industry in reducing shipbuilding costs and achieving cost savings. The committee recommends an increase of $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including establishing a national program for developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce and a concept for improving shipbuilding production. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including establishing a national program for developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, creating a national supply chain to reduce material costs, exploring secondary markets for shipbuilders, and implementing industry-wide computer interoperability. The committee recommends increasing funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including establishing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, creating a national supply chain, exploring secondary markets for shipbuilders, and implementing industry-wide computer interoperability. Authorization for incremental funding and cost caps for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and LHA(R) amphibious assault ships is also included in the legislation. Section 122 sets unit procurement cost caps for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases caps for CVN-77. Section 125 establishes caps for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, and Section 126 for LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Section 215 authorizes funds for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals, and Section 1016 directs an assessment of naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The Defense Acquisition Challenge Program includes technology proposals. Section 1016 requires the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual written notice to the congressional defense committees regarding changes to cost limitations for the CVN-21 class budget. Many uncertainties remain in completing the design and construction of the future class of nuclear powered aircraft carriers. The conferees acknowledge uncertainties in completing the design and construction of the CVN-21 class budget for nuclear powered aircraft carriers. An amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks in program execution. The Navy is expected to manage program execution effectively. The amendment allows adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks in program execution for the CVN-21 class. Compliance with this provision may require procurement cost trade-offs that could impact system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and other important factors in design and construction. The conferees believe that cost-driven reductions in the design and construction of the CVN-21 class may impact safety, crew quality of life, or hinder meeting operational requirements. The Secretary must notify the Committees on Armed Services before implementing any such reductions. The Secretary must notify the Committees on Armed Services at least 30 days before making any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or hinder meeting operational requirements for the CVN-21 class. The amendment does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The amendment does not grant the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. However, the Secretary must include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual notice to the defense committees. The LHA-6 budget represents the Navy's risk-balanced assessment for completing the future LHA Replacement ship. The conferees understand the Navy's risk-balanced assessment of the cost for completing the future LHA Replacement ship. They recognize uncertainties in design and construction, allowing adjustments to the cost limitation for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk. The Navy is expected to address any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget estimates, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that may impact capabilities, system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and future growth margin of the LHA Replacement ship. The conferees expect cost trade-offs in the design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship, with potential impacts on capabilities, system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and future growth margin. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of controlling costs in ship design and construction to ensure the viability of the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. The Secretary must notify Congress before making any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or the program's requirements. The Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for the Navy to control costs in ship design and construction for the viability of its long-range shipbuilding plan. Navy leadership acknowledges the importance of cost control but has not provided a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets and develop specific initiatives for cost control in future shipbuilding programs. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets in shipbuilding programs and develop initiatives for cost control. It recommended reducing funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, urging the Navy to set firm cost targets and develop initiatives for cost control. It recommended reducing funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The Navy's plan to address cost overruns was submitted late and lacked substance, highlighting a gap between public statements and actual actions. The Committee is concerned about cost overruns in Navy shipbuilding programs, specifically in the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines. The Navy estimates an overrun of $867.9 million in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years, requiring Congressional legislation to raise the cost cap. The Navy faces cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with an estimated $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 aircraft carrier production over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap. Additionally, the U.S.S. Texas and U.S.S. North Carolina submarines are experiencing cost growth and performance issues, jeopardizing Navy goals and production rates. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with the Virginia class submarines performing below expectations. This jeopardizes the Navy's ability to meet performance goals and cost targets set in a multiyear contract. The Committee is unwilling to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns without a compelling justification or detailed cost control plan. The recommended funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs is $436,449,000, a reduction of $141,400,000 from the request, with allocations for specific programs. The Committee recommends $436,449,000 for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, a $141,400,000 reduction from the request. The reduction is allocated to specific programs including CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding, proposed to average $14.4 billion in the Navy's FY2007 budget and FY2007-FY2011 shipbuilding plan. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to an average of $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars is proposed in the Navy's FY2007 budget. However, this may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy has been working on operating more efficiently to save costs for procurement. Increasing Navy ship procurement funding may necessitate cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities due to finite defense funding. Efforts to operate more efficiently have not fully offset rising costs in other areas. Alternative funding approaches like incremental funding or advance appropriations are being considered to address this issue. One option to increase Navy ship procurement funding is to modify the funding method, such as using incremental funding or advance appropriations. Another option is to utilize multiyear procurement contracts in Navy ship-procurement programs. These changes could potentially increase the number of ships procured but may also raise concerns about Congressional oversight and funding allocation. One option to increase Navy ship procurement funding is to modify the funding method, such as using incremental funding or advance appropriations. Another option is to utilize multiyear procurement contracts in Navy ship-procurement programs, which could marginally increase the number of ships procured but may limit flexibility in adjusting plans in response to changing circumstances. Utilizing multiyear procurement contracts in Navy ship-procurement programs could reduce costs, but may limit flexibility in adjusting plans. Changing the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard, could save $3 billion for 10 ships. Shifting to a single-yard acquisition strategy for building DDG-1000s could save $3 billion for 10 ships, but may limit competition and innovation in design. The Navy may consider using competition more in ship acquisition to drive design innovation, control costs, and ensure timely delivery. This shift could involve awarding contracts to different shipyards for building follow-on ships in each class, a practice reminiscent of Navy procedures in the 1980s. Using competition in Navy ship acquisition could involve awarding contracts to different shipyards for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. This approach requires a high annual procurement rate or a willingness for losing yards to permanently withdraw from the competition. The government can consider giving ships to specific yards without risking their financial health or leading to a yard permanently exiting the shipbuilding business. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. One option to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is to eliminate excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. This would eliminate fixed overhead costs associated with maintaining that capacity or increase other types of work done by those yards to absorb a greater portion of the fixed overhead costs. Other potential work includes building ships for other U.S. government agencies like the Coast Guard or NOAA, as well as commercial construction. One option to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is to eliminate excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. This could involve increasing other types of work done by those yards, such as construction for other U.S. government agencies or commercial ships. Another option is to improve operating efficiency by incorporating advanced design and production processes, as seen in the National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE). The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve the operating efficiency of yards building Navy ships by incorporating advanced design and production processes. A DOD report from May 2005 compares the efficiency of U.S. yards to foreign shipyards and suggests building Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs. Building Navy ships without some planned equipment could reduce costs, but may also decrease capabilities. The option to add the equipment later would restore capabilities but defer some procurement costs into the future. Installing equipment on an in-service ship may be more expensive than building it into the ship during its original construction process. This strategy could increase the total procurement cost of the ship above what it would have been if built with all planned equipment from the beginning. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards where construction costs may be lower due to lower wages. Building Navy ships in foreign shipyards could potentially lower construction costs due to lower wages and material prices. However, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards, unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. The provision in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of Navy ships in foreign shipyards, unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. The President can make exceptions with notification to Congress, and no contract can be made until after a 30-day period. Inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats are exempt from this provision. Additionally, the annual DOD appropriations act includes a provision for Navy shipbuilding funds. The annual DOD appropriations act prohibits the use of funds for Navy shipbuilding in foreign shipyards, including the construction of major components. Inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats are exempt from this provision. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to the past and suggests ways to reduce these costs."
