    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and decrease the risk of youth becoming victims of crime by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001. After school programs have proven beneficial in many states. After school programs are endorsed by many governors and law enforcement officials to address social issues facing youth, such as drugs, alcohol, and gang involvement. Over 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with police organizations representing 360,000 officers, advocate for after school programs providing recreation, academic support, and community service for children and teens in the US. Investing in safe and positive after school learning environments is crucial for school-age children and teens in the United States. The Act aims to increase academic success, promote safe after-school environments, provide alternatives to negative activities, and reduce juvenile crime. It also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include additional stakeholders in the program. Recipients are required to provide at least 35 percent of the annual project cost from sources other than government funds. The Century Community Learning Centers Act amendment requires recipients to contribute 35% of project costs from non-government sources. The Century Community Learning Centers Act amendment mandates recipients to contribute 35% of project costs from non-government sources, and not more than 25% from other federal programs. Recipients must also maintain their fiscal effort from non-federal sources each year. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to allow grants for establishing or expanding community learning centers that provide various activities, including job skills preparation and after school programs with specific requirements. After school programs may include mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. They may also involve drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, as well as health and nutrition counseling. After school programs must allocate at least 2/3 of the funds for activities like drug prevention, health counseling, and job skills preparation. These programs can also offer mentoring, academic assistance, and technology training. SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATION. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include provisions for local educational agencies, schools, or consortia to involve volunteers from various communities, ensure youth participation in designing after-school activities, and use creative outreach methods. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act now includes provisions for involving volunteers from various communities, ensuring youth participation in designing after-school activities, and using creative outreach methods. Additionally, it encourages requesting donations of equipment, working with park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities, and serving as mentors in Athletic and Activity Leagues. SEC. 9. Amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to include law enforcement organizations like the Police Athletic and Activity League. SEC. 10.
