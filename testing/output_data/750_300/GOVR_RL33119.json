    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, the most recent authorization for federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). After October 1, 2003, federal surface transportation programs operated on short-term extension acts. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for accommodating long-term planning and construction needs in the surface transportation community. Despite the consensus in the surface transportation community that long-term reauthorizations are preferred for planning and construction needs, short-term extensions have caused uncertainty in funding. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by highway and transit interests, even though delays shortened its duration to just over four years, expiring in FY2009. Highway and transit interests welcomed the passage of SAFETEA, despite delays shortening its duration to just over four years, expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely tied to the revenue from the highway trust fund, primarily funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. These taxes account for about 90% of the trust fund's income. The highway trust fund is primarily funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, providing about 90% of its income. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon, with a portion reserved for a leaking underground storage tank fund. There have been several tax increases over the fund's almost 50-year lifespan, with the last one in 1993. The highway trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, has seen several tax increases over its almost 50-year lifespan. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation, with tax revenues of $31 billion for the highway account and $5 billion for the mass transit account in FY2004. The trust funds have historically collected more than expended, as defined by Congress. The highway trust fund received tax revenues of $31 billion for the highway account and $5 billion for the mass transit account in FY2004. The trust funds historically collected more than expended, but the unexpended balance is declining, leading to uncertainty about the long-term financial outlook. The highway trust fund's unexpended balance is declining, causing uncertainty about its long-term financial outlook. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided the trust fund with additional future income through changes in federal gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion per year starting in FY2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 aimed to boost the highway trust fund's income by altering federal gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion annually starting in FY2005. However, disagreements between Congress, the Administration, and the Conference Committee hindered agreement on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. The House and the Administration disagreed on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. Some Members of Congress supported more project funding than the Bush Administration. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes, while Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to support a larger program. Some Members of Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to support a larger program, but these changes alone were not enough to fund the desired program size. Conferees on SAFETEA considered various tax and revenue-increasing measures to offset additional highway and transit spending, with modest revenue increases mainly from cutting back on tax fraud and transferring funds. The finance title of the act included provisions to increase revenues for the trust fund and offset highway and transit spending. Revenue increases were considered modest, mainly from cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that these changes, along with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, would be enough to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. (CRS contacts: John Fischer and Robert Kirk) The SAFETEA act, in conjunction with gasohol legislation changes in 2004 and expected economic growth, was expected to finance the $286.4 billion program. TEA-21 altered the highway trust fund's relationship with the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting limitations on obligations. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003 and introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes. The changes made by TEA-21 created new budget categories for highway and mass transit, setting limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes, while also setting a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs. These changes separate these categories from the rest of the discretionary budget to prevent the use of funds assigned to them. The changes introduced by TEA-21 set predetermined funding levels for core highway and transit programs, creating \"firewalls\" to prevent funds from being used for other purposes. These firewalls were seen as guaranteed minimum funding levels. SAFETEA has maintained this budget format largely unchanged. SAFETEA provides $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for highway and transit programs from FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21's $218 billion over FY1998-2003. The debate mainly focused on money distribution. SAFETEA provides $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for highway and transit programs from FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21. The funding increase was not as much as originally hoped for, but still represents a substantial boost for federal surface transportation programs. SAFETEA provides over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with significant funding increases for all major programs. Total spending in FY2009 is almost 23% higher than in FY2005. The exempt obligation category is for equity bonus and emergency funding, not a program. Total annual spending increases each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which the Bush Administration opposed. Detailed funding information can be found in the report's Appendix and at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The House version of SAFETEA included a \"re-opener\" provision for Congress to reconsider funding later, opposed by the Bush Administration. TEA-21 adjusted highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes, allowing for increases or reductions in funding. RABA provided significant changes in its first three years. The RABA calculation under SAFETEA allowed for adjustments in highway program funding based on trust fund revenue changes. Initially, RABA provided additional spending authority, but in FY2003, a program reduction was called for. Congress chose to increase spending instead of reducing it, leading to a push for a less dramatic calculation of revenue swings. SAFETEA changed the RABA calculation to use a two-year average to mitigate drastic revenue fluctuations. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated by using a two-year average and delaying calculations until FY2007. It also prevents spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance exceeds $6 billion. Transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along party lines. Since 1982, Congress has addressed concerns over the distribution of federal highway aid among states through minimum guarantee provisions, ensuring no spending reductions if the highway trust fund balance is over $6 billion. Transportation policy debates often reflect regional rather than partisan divisions, with some states, particularly in the South, Midwest, and West, feeling they receive inadequate funding. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. Donor states seek a higher share rate-of-return, while donee states have not opposed equity provisions. Donor states are advocating for a higher share rate-of-return, most recently 95%, on their tax payments to the Treasury. They argue that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in donee states, especially in the Northeast, and are more road dependent, not benefiting from federal transit spending. Advocates argue that donor states have been subsidizing infrastructure repair in donee states, especially in the Northeast. They claim they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending. Southern and western donor states argue they are fast-growing areas with needs as great or greater. Donee state advocates emphasize fairness should consider needs, not just tax contributions. Advocates of donee states argue that fairness should be based on needs, not just tax contributions. They justify their donee status by pointing to the age of their infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources in sparsely populated western states. They also argue for a national highway network that considers federal needs over state boundaries. Advocates of donee states argue that resources in large sparsely populated western states justify their donee status, emphasizing the need for a national highway network based on federal needs rather than state boundaries. They criticize Midwestern and southern states for seeking federal funds without investing their own resources, raising broader issues of equity in transportation funding. The debate over equity remedies in transportation funding raises questions about the federal government's role as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. Some states propose broadening the Minimum Guarantee (MG) to include additional transportation needs. The 109th Congress faced a policy problem in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless, as the HTF revenue base was insufficient. Some states proposed broadening the Minimum Guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The 109th Congress had to address conflicting demands from donor and donee states regarding the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenue base. To overcome Senate filibusters, a minimum guarantee (MG) mechanism was proposed with \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. This required increasing the federal highway program size to meet MG percentage targets. To address conflicting demands from donor and donee states regarding the Highway Trust Fund revenue base, previous reauthorization bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. This required increasing the federal highway program size significantly to bring donor state shares up to a designated percentage, such as 90.5% during TEA21. Providing equity remedies in this way has been costly in dollar terms. The TEA-21 program aimed to provide equity by giving more money to all states, with donor states receiving even more to reach a designated percentage share. This approach was costly, leading to the largest highway program under TEA-21. SAFETEA replaced the program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to gradually increase the guaranteed rate-of-return to states. The SAFETEA legislation replaced the TEA-21 program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to gradually increase the guaranteed rate-of-return to states. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return percentage for fiscal years 2005-2009. The SAFETEA legislation replaced TEA-21 with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to increase guaranteed rate-of-return levels for states. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return percentage for fiscal years 2005-2009. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA legislation increased guaranteed rate-of-return levels for states, with funds allocated to ensure each state receives a minimum return percentage for fiscal years 2005-2009. The program includes various formula programs and hold harmless provisions for certain states. States will receive the greater of the annual percent return or their share of total apportionments over six years under TEA-21. To be held harmless, states must meet specific criteria such as population density, population size, median household income, fatality rate on highways, or state motor fuel excise tax rate. Twenty-seven states with household income less than $35,000, high fatality rates on Interstate Highways, or high state motor fuel excise tax rates qualify for the EB program. These states include Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The EB program ensures that no state receives less than a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees that qualifying states receive a set percentage of their average annual TEA-21 apportionments. Annual percentage floors are set for each fiscal year, ranging from 117% to 121%. The programmatic distribution of funds to states prioritizes the Surface Transportation Program (STP) with the first $2.639 billion each year. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees qualifying states a set percentage of their annual apportionments, ranging from 117% to 121% for FY2005 to FY2009. Funds are distributed to the STP first, with any amount above $2.639 billion allocated to core programs based on each program's apportionment ratio. Funds above $2.639 billion are distributed to six core programs: IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and HSIP based on apportionment ratios. Over five years, EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Funds for these programs are apportioned annually to states using SAFETEA formulas. The programs discussed are apportioned to states annually using SAFETEA formulas. They are also known as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five core programs, which accounted for 86% of highway spending. SAFETEA increased the core programs from five to six, including IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. SAFETEA increased the core highway programs from five to six, including IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs. Additionally, there is a seventh program called the equity bonus (EB), which replaced the TEA-21 minimum guarantee program. The SAFETEA legislation increased core highway programs to six, including IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs, with additional smaller apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. SAFETEA also introduced two new formula programs, including the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) replacing the TEA-21 discretionary program. The SAFETEA legislation introduced new formula programs, including the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding under the Federal-Aid Highway program was apportioned to states based on specific factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code. The SAFETEA legislation introduced new formula programs for apportioning funding to states based on specific factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code. These factors include lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, estimated tax payments, deficient bridges, and non-attainment area population under the Clean Air Act. While SAFETEA did not make major changes to existing program formulas, it did eliminate the 10% safety STP set-aside. The SAFETEA legislation made adjustments to existing program formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and creating a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction. Adjustments were also made to the calculation of weighted non-attainment and maintenance areas for ozone under the new 8-hour area standards. The SAFETEA legislation made adjustments to program formulas, including creating a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington. Additionally, adjustments were made to the calculation of weighted non-attainment and maintenance areas for ozone under new standards. The National Highway System set-aside for the Territorial Highway Program is set at $40 million for FY2005-FY2006 and $50 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15% with the 35% ceiling removed. The formula distribution for the off-system bridge program is adjusted, with a weighted distribution based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP and distributed based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. Under the Railway-Highway Crossings program, funding is distributed to states based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings. A portion of the funds must be set aside for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. The allocation formula changed under SAFETEA to include funds for states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders. Under SAFETEA, funds for states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders are apportioned based on specific criteria, including commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, incoming cargo weight, and number of ports-of-entry. Funds for states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders are apportioned based on specific criteria, including commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, incoming cargo weight, and number of ports-of-entry. The funds are to be apportioned among the states based on total student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with no state receiving less than $1 million. Enrollment in primary and middle schools in each state is proportional to total student enrollment in all states. No state receives less than $1 million. Highway programs not apportioned are allocated based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. Programs in TEA-21 and SAFETEA are smaller than core programs, with some receiving significant funding. The largest program in SAFETEA is for congressionally mandated high priority. In SAFETEA, congressional earmarking includes programs with significant funding levels such as high priority projects, federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. Additionally, SAFETEA introduces new large allocated programs like the transportation improvement program. SAFETEA introduces new large allocated programs such as the transportation improvement program, national corridor infrastructure program, and projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The act also includes project selection criteria for the latter program. The SAFETEA act introduces new programs for transportation projects, including projects of national or regional significance. These programs are subject to 100% earmarking and have project selection criteria. Innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs are used to speed up project completion and leverage additional funds. The SAFETEA act introduces new programs for transportation projects, including projects of national or regional significance, with 100% earmarking and project selection criteria. Innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs are used to speed up project completion and leverage additional funds. Changes in TIFIA and SIB programs have been studied by GAO, CBO, and FHWA. SAFETEA introduces changes in federal innovative finance programs TIFIA and SIB. It offers three types of financial assistance for transportation projects and reduces project size thresholds. $122 million annually is allocated for TIFIA's leveraging activities. SAFETEA reduces project size thresholds for transportation projects and allocates $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. It also expands the SIB program to allow any state to establish SIBs with federal funds. SAFETEA allows states to establish SIBs with federal funds for tolling programs, including HOV lanes. Section 1143 of the act concerning private facility bonds is also expected to impact tolling. The program is authorized for 15 tolling projects with funding allocated for FY2005 and FY2006-FY2009. The act authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for tolling projects. $3 million is allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The program directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects for states, public authorities, or private entities. The new program authorizes funding for tolling projects to manage congestion, reduce emissions, and expand highways. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects for designated entities. The new program authorizes funding for tolling projects to manage congestion, reduce emissions, and expand highways, primarily through HOT lanes. Revenues from toll facilities can be used for debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Excess revenues may be allocated to federal-aid highway or transit projects if the facility meets maintenance standards. Toll facilities under this program can vary tolls based on demand. The new toll program allows toll facilities to set variable tolls based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. High occupancy vehicle lanes must also vary tolls based on traffic conditions. Electronic toll collection is required for express lanes. The act establishes a pilot toll program allowing states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. Interested states must demonstrate financing through toll collection on three facilities. The pilot toll program allows states to collect fees on three Interstate System highways for construction purposes, demonstrating that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. States cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads adjacent to toll facilities to address traffic-related issues. The state is restricted from improving public roads near toll facilities to alleviate traffic issues caused by diverted traffic. Revenues from tolls can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs. Interstate Maintenance program funds cannot be used on toll facilities. The provision in Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to permit vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes, including those on the Interstate System. The state agency must establish a program for motorists to enroll, develop a system for toll collection, set policies to manage demand by adjusting toll amounts, and maintain the toll program. The act in Section 1121 allows for the tolling of vehicles in HOV lanes, with policies for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. It also permits preferential rates for low emission vehicles. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The act allows for tolling of vehicles in HOV lanes and preferential rates for low emission vehicles. It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The bonds can be issued by state and local governments for projects such as highways, international tunnels or bridges, and truck-train transfer facilities. The act allows for tax-exempt bonds to finance highway projects, international tunnels or bridges, and truck-train transfer facilities. A $15 billion limit is placed on the bonds that can be issued, with potential substantial impact if fully utilized. The bonding provision in SAFETEA allows for tax-exempt bonds to finance highway projects, tunnels, and transfer facilities with a $15 billion limit on issued bonds. The provision could have a substantial impact if fully utilized, potentially creating significant infrastructure. It is considered one of the most important tolling provisions in SAFETEA, with projects likely requiring tolls for support unless alternative revenue mechanisms are established. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to connect Appalachia and boost economic development. It is funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Projects using private activity bonds may need tolls for support unless alternative revenue sources are available. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) is funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates for the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). 85% of ADHS roads are either completed or under construction. An estimated $4.47 billion in additional federal funds is needed to complete the system. Under TEA-21, ADHP receives $450 million in contract authority annually. The ADHS 2002 Cost to Complete Report estimated the additional federal funds needed to complete the system at $4.47 billion. Under TEA-21, the ADHP received $450 million in contract authority annually. SAFETEA provides $470 million annually for the ADHP, with a prohibition on using toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds. SAFETEA has a higher level of earmarking compared to TEA-21 in terms of projects and funding. SAFETEA significantly increases earmarking for high priority projects in the highway title, with over 5,092 earmarks worth $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. Three new earmarked categories have been introduced in SAFETEA. SAFETEA introduces over 5,092 earmarks worth $14.8 billion for high priority projects in the highway title, including projects of national and regional significance and national corridor infrastructure improvements valued at $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. The HPP program includes larger scope projects, while national corridor infrastructure improvements have 33 earmarks valued at over $1.9 billion. Additionally, transportation improvements have 465 projects with over $2.5 billion in funding, which is a new program without clear distinctions from the HPP program. The new transportation program has over $2.5 billion in funding, with projects that may overlap with those in the HPP program. There are also additional earmarks totaling almost $1 billion in the bill. The transportation bill includes numerous earmarks totaling over $24 billion, with specific projects in various titles requiring significant funding. The transportation bill includes $1.6 billion in funding and 39 stand-alone earmarks valued at over $191 million. The total amount of earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion. Earmarking effects the Equity Bonus calculation, with two types of earmarks in the bill for EB purposes. This computation significantly affects state shares. The transportation bill includes $1.6 billion in funding and 39 stand-alone earmarks valued at over $191 million. Earmarks in the bill for Equity Bonus purposes are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line,\" impacting state shares. Highway title earmarks like HPPs are below the line, while other programs and miscellaneous earmarks are above the line. Transit earmarks and Transportation Enhancements program activities remain separate from the Equity Bonus calculation. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program funds various projects such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and scenic beautification. Transit earmarks are not included in the Equity Bonus calculation. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program funds various projects such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, scenic beautification, rehabilitation of historic transportation buildings, preservation of railway corridors for trails, inventory of outdoor advertising, archeological research, environmental mitigation, and transportation museums. The funding mechanism for TE program activities has been modified under TEA-21. The funding mechanism for TE program activities has been modified under SAFETEA (Sec. 133(d)(2)), ensuring that additional funding is available for transportation enhancement projects. The TE program funding has been modified under SAFETEA to ensure more funding for transportation enhancement projects. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans, with funding authorized for projects improving efficiency. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans by funding projects that improve efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and ensure access to jobs and services. Eligible recipients include state, tribal, regional, and local governments. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans by funding projects that improve efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and ensure access to jobs, services, and centers of trade. State, tribal, regional, and local governments are eligible to receive TCSP grants, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years. The TCSP program, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years, saw varying levels of funding under TEA-21, ranging from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $273 million in FY2002. Competitive grants were awarded in FY1999, while projects were earmarked in the annual transportation appropriations bills from FY2000 to FY2003. SAFETEA continued funding for TCSP projects. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, funded through the TCSP program, received varying levels of funding from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $273 million in FY2002. SAFETEA continued to provide significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs, promoting non-motorized trips and safety initiatives. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, funded through the TCSP program, supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility. States can allocate TE funds for facilities, safety, education activities, and preservation of railway corridors for pedestrian or bicycle trails. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these purposes. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, funded through the TCSP program, supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility by providing facilities, safety, education activities, and preserving railway corridors for pedestrian or bicycle trails. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were allocated for these purposes, with pedestrian and bicycle facilities accounting for 46.3% of programmed activities. Additionally, other programs within Titles 23 and 49 USC also support the construction of bicycle and pedestrian facilities associated with road and transit projects, including the Safe Routes to School Program under SAFETEA. The Safe Routes to School Program, a new initiative under SAFETEA, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities. It seeks to make these activities safer and more attractive, encouraging a healthy lifestyle from an early age. The program will receive $612 million in funding for FY2004-FY2009, apportioned among states based on specific criteria. The Safe Routes to School Program, funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities. Funding will be apportioned among states based on student enrollment ratios, with each state receiving a minimum of $1 million per year. The Secretary will set aside up to $3 million for administrative expenses. Each state would receive a minimum apportionment of $1 million per fiscal year for the Safe Routes to School Program. The federal share of project costs is 100%, with funds remaining available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds for the Safe Routes to School Program are not transferable and will remain available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations. Projects funded can be used for infrastructure-related improvements to enhance walking and biking to school. The Safe Routes to School Program funds infrastructure improvements to promote walking and biking to school, including sidewalk, traffic calming, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossing, and secure bike parking. Funds can also be used for noninfrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns and traffic education. The Safe Routes to School Program funds infrastructure improvements for walking and biking to school, as well as noninfrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns and traffic education. States must allocate 10-30% of funding for non-infrastructure activities. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to allocate 10-30% of funding for non-infrastructure activities. States must use a portion of the funding to support a full-time coordinator for the program. The Secretary is also mandated to provide grants to a national nonprofit organization for promoting safe routes to schools, operating a national clearinghouse, and offering technical assistance and educational programs. The Safe Routes to School Program mandates states to allocate funding for non-infrastructure activities and support a full-time coordinator. Funding for a national safe routes to school clearinghouse will come from the Secretary's administrative expenses. A task force is established to study and develop a strategy for advancing safe routes to school programs nationwide. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for a five-year authorization period. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), with a total of $52.6 billion including FY2004 funding. Congress shifted the share of funding going to various parts of the transit program, reducing the share going to the Urbanized Area Formula Program from 47.9% to 44.0%. Congress made changes to transit funding under TEA-21, with a shift in funding shares between urbanized and non-urbanized areas. The share going to urbanized areas decreased from 47.9% to 44.0%, while the share going to non-urbanized areas increased from 3.3% to 5.2%. Funding distribution also changed among states, with a decrease in funding for larger states and an increase for smaller states. Overall, the act made minor adjustments to transit funding. The TEA-21 act made minor changes to transit funding, including a shift in funding shares between urbanized and non-urbanized areas. Funding distribution among states also changed, with larger states receiving less funding and smaller states receiving more. Additionally, new programs were added, funding categories were created, and changes were made to existing programs. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) made changes to transit funding, including new programs and adjustments to existing ones. Provisions included requiring federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes as a benefit, making alternatives analysis eligible for FTA grants, and earmarking funds for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. These changes provided an additional $1.7 billion in funding. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program for FY2006-FY2009 received $1.7 billion in additional funding, with half of the funds apportioned to states based on population forecasts for 15 years beyond the most recent Census. The funds are distributed to urbanized and non-urbanized areas within each state according to the urban-rural ratio. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program for FY2006-FY2009 allocates funds to states based on population forecasts for 15 years beyond the most recent Census. Half of the funding goes to urbanized and non-urbanized areas within each state based on the urban-rural ratio, while the other half is for urbanized areas in states with population densities exceeding 370 persons per mile. The program aims to improve transportation services for persons with disabilities, including access to jobs and employment support services, with a total authorization of $339 million. The program aims to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities, including access to jobs and employment support services. It is authorized at a total of $339 million over FY2006-FY2009. Additionally, there is a discretionary grant program to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, with a total authorization of $97 million. A grant program is established to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, including access for persons with disabilities. The program has a total authorization of $97 million and is exempt from certain labor protection provisions. Additionally, a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding for small areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program includes a one-percent set-aside for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population, providing additional funding for transit services comparable to larger urbanized areas. This program measures transit service levels based on various factors and aims to address formula funding issues. The Urbanized Area Formula Program measures transit service levels for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population. Unlike larger urbanized areas, the formula for smaller areas does not include performance factors to reduce data collection burden on transit providers. The Urbanized Area Formula Program for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population does not include performance factors to reduce data collection burden on transit providers. This difference in treatment results in small areas with higher transit service levels not receiving adequate funding compared to those with lower service levels. DOT was directed to study this issue and consider changes to the funding formulas to reward transit-intensive areas. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program may shift 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000 in population to reward transit-intensive areas. This change is part of a new category within the New Starts program, which funds new fixed-guideway transit systems or extensions. The New Starts program, a part of the Urbanized Areas Formula Program, funds new fixed-guideway transit systems or extensions. Projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding (Small Starts) will undergo a streamlined evaluation process.

SAFETEA authorizes a new grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), which replaces the existing roadway hazard elimination program. This program funded projects like installing barriers and guard rails. Under TEA-21, funding for infrastructure hazard elimination programs came from a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program, totaling $560 million in FY2005. The HSIP Program, authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006, replaced the roadway hazard elimination program funded through a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program. States were required to spend at least $317 million annually on hazard elimination, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. The new HSIP Program, authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006, allows states to use $317 million for hazard elimination, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. Funding is apportioned based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on the federal-aid highway system. No state will receive less than 0.5% of the funding. The HSIP program allocates funding based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States receive a minimum of 0.5% of the funding. $220 million is reserved annually for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination, and $90 million is reserved for high-risk rural road projects.

It also directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in side impacts. The act aims to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in side impacts through the implementation of ITS technology. ITS technology is utilized in highway or transit projects to enhance performance and safety. It allows traffic management centers to receive real-time data on traffic flow, incidents, weather conditions, and more. This information helps operators redirect traffic, coordinate emergency response, and improve the surface transportation system. Federal investment in ITS during the later years of TEA-21 was approximately $230 million annually. During the later years of TEA-21, federal investment in ITS totaled about $230 million annually, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million yearly for ITS research. The ITS deployment program ended after FY2005, with project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The focus is on advancing technologies, improving standards, and providing training. The ITS deployment program ended after FY2005, with project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The act focuses on advancing technologies, improving standards, and providing training for reducing challenges in surface transportation systems. Technology deployment activities play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the nation's surface transportation systems, such as congestion, security, traffic accidents, environmental degradation, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The federal government, through agencies like FHWA, FTA, and NHTSA, aims to promote the use of safer technologies and processes to mitigate these challenges.

Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts for freight rail transportation. Congress is evaluating the ability of freight railroads to expand their infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion, primarily financed without government aid. The federal government is considering assisting freight railroads in expanding their networks to handle more freight, as they primarily finance their infrastructure needs without government aid. There is also a concern about the increasing frequency of freight train traffic through towns and city neighborhoods, leading to delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. Railroads have reduced the total number of railway miles in service but are utilizing their remaining track more intensely. Railroads have increased train frequency, causing delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. They are utilizing their remaining track more intensely to improve efficiency. Congressional concerns include the captive shipper question since rail industry deregulation in 1980. Members of Congress are worried about high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. Some Members of Congress are concerned about high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. Legislation in the 109th Congress and SAFETEA address these issues, with section 9007 requesting a report on the performance of the nation's rail system. The Transportation Research Board of the National Academies reports to Congress on the nation's rail system performance, service quality, rates, and public policy effectiveness. SAFETEA expands federal loan program for rail track rehabilitation to $35 billion.

Projects of National and Regional Significance include improving rail connections in Chicago, eliminating grade crossings in Los Angeles, and studying a plan to relocate El Paso. The SAFETEA program allocated funds for various rail projects, including a freight rail tunnel under New York harbor, improving rail connections in Chicago, eliminating grade crossings in Los Angeles, studying a plan to relocate El Paso rail yards, and relocating a rail line connection to the Port of Portsmouth, Virginia. Additionally, the Department of Transportation was directed to conduct a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980. The Department of Transportation was directed to conduct a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980, including service levels, quality, rates of major railroads, projected demand for freight rail service, and constraints on meeting that demand. Additionally, a new grant program called \"Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program\" was created to improve freight mobility around U.S. international and inland ports. The SAFETEA Act establishes the Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program, providing $6 million in grants annually from 2005 to 2009 to enhance freight mobility around U.S. ports. Six projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina are designated for this program. Additionally, the act continues the Recreational Trails Program to support the development and maintenance of recreational trails for motorized and non-motorized use. The SAFETEA Act continues the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) as a federal-aid program to help states develop and maintain recreational trails for various trail uses. RTP funds can be used for activities such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, snowmobiling, and off-road vehicle use, but not for property condemnation or constructing new trails on certain federal lands. The SAFETEA Act authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) for FY2005-2009. Funds can be used for various trail uses like hiking, biking, horseback riding, snowmobiling, and off-road vehicle use, but not for property condemnation or constructing new trails on certain federal lands. Administrative expenses are set at $840,000 annually. The SAFETEA Act authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) for FY2005-2009. Funds are allocated to states based on a legislative formula and must be used for motorized, non-motorized, and diverse trail uses. The RTP is subject to the same annual obligation limitation as other federal-aid highway programs. SAFETEA eliminates the discretionary waiver from the 30% provisions. The SAFETEA Act authorizes $370 million for the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) for FY2005-2009. States must allocate funds for motorized, non-motorized, and diverse trail uses. The program is subject to the same obligation limitation as other federal-aid highway programs. SAFETEA eliminates the discretionary waiver for the 30% provisions and retains the small state exemption. The \"sliding scale\" provision provides additional federal share for states with large federal lands. SAFETEA amends the Recreational Trails Program by changing the federal share for projects and encouraging states to use youth conservation or service corps. It also expands the permissible uses for RTP funding to include non-law enforcement trail safety and monitoring patrols. SAFETEA amends the Recreational Trails Program to allow states to use youth conservation or service corps for trail construction and maintenance. It expands the permissible uses of RTP funding to include non-law enforcement trail safety, monitoring patrols, and trail-related training, with a limit of 5% of the state's apportionment. Additionally, funding is now permitted for trail condition assessment for accessibility and maintenance. SAFETEA permits pre-approval planning and environmental compliance costs to be credited toward the non-federal share for RTP projects. DOT must comply with environmental review requirements before final design, property acquisition, or construction can proceed on a highway or transit project. NEPA requirements must be met. Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT (FHWA or FTA) must comply with environmental review requirements, including those of NEPA. NEPA mandates federal agencies to consider environmental impacts of proposed actions and prepare an EIS for federally funded projects significantly affecting the human environment. NEPA requires DOT to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for federally funded projects that significantly affect the human environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an environmental assessment (EA), and if impacts are deemed significant, an EIS must be prepared. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Projects with no significant social, economic, or environmental impact are processed as categorical exclusions by DOT. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required within the NEPA process. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is necessary within the NEPA process. The law prohibits using certain resources for transportation projects unless there are no feasible alternatives and all efforts are made to minimize harm. Some Members of Congress are concerned about inefficiencies in the environmental review process for large projects. The project must comply with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, ensuring no feasible alternatives exist and efforts are made to minimize harm. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies in the environmental review process for large projects, leading to delays in completion. Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to deliver federally funded transportation projects in a timely manner while protecting the environment. FHWA defines environmental streamlining as timely delivery of federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for success. TEA-21 requires DOT to implement a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. The streamlining provisions of TEA-21 mandated the Department of Transportation to develop a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. This process aimed to encourage early participation by relevant federal and state agencies. Some Members of Congress called for further legislation to expedite the environmental review process. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. These provisions aim to expedite compliance with various environmental regulations. SAFETEA includes provisions to expedite compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements for highway construction and transit projects, streamlining the environmental review process. The term \"streamlining\" is not explicitly used in SAFETEA, but the goal remains the same - to accelerate compliance with environmental regulations. Many provisions in SAFETEA codify existing regulatory requirements related to NEPA. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements for transportation projects by streamlining the environmental review process. Key provisions include designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of agencies, and introducing participating agencies in the NEPA process. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements for transportation projects by streamlining the environmental review process. Key provisions include the establishment of a new entity in the NEPA process called a \"participating agency,\" setting deadlines for decision-making, and implementing procedures for collaborative development of project statements. The SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements for transportation projects by streamlining the environmental review process. Key provisions include establishing deadlines for comments, a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, using transportation funds to expedite reviews, a dispute resolution process for disagreements, allowing states to determine categorical exclusions for projects. The SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements for transportation projects by streamlining the environmental review process. Key provisions include establishing deadlines for comments, a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, a dispute resolution process for disagreements, and allowing states to determine categorical exclusions for projects. Additionally, SAFETEA allows for the use of publicly owned parks and recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges if it is determined that such use would result in \"de minimis impacts\" to that resource. SAFETEA allows for the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with de minimis impacts, requiring concurrence from relevant authorities. DOT must issue regulations within one year to clarify these provisions. SAFETEA allows for the use of historic sites with de minimis impacts if determined under the National Historic Preservation Act. DOT must issue regulations clarifying factors for determining \"prudent and feasible\" alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. Under SAFETEA, the Interstate System cannot be classified as a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. However, individual elements of the system may still have historic significance and be protected under Section 4(f) requirements. ISTEA in 1991 directed the Secretary of DOT to establish a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) directed the Secretary of DOT to establish a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The CMAQ Program authorized funding for projects to reduce carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone. Eligible projects include transportation control measures and inspection and maintenance. The CMAQ program, established under ISTEA, provides funding for projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone levels in areas not meeting NAAQS. Eligible projects include transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is apportioned based on population and pollution reduction needs. TEA-21 expanded the CMAQ program to include projects targeting particulate matter (PM) reduction, while maintaining the apportionment formula based on ozone and CO levels. States with no nonattainment areas are guaranteed a minimum funding allocation. SAFETEA amended the CMAQ apportionment formula and program requirements, expanding program funding. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 was $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. States with only PM nonattainment areas receive guaranteed minimum CMAQ funding. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ program funding to $8.6 billion for FY2005-FY2009, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. Eligibility for CMAQ funds now includes projects like advanced truck stop electrification, transportation system improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits with funding priority. SAFETEA includes directives for transportation system management, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It allows states to use CMAQ funds for eligible projects and mandates evaluation of CMAQ projects' impact on air quality and congestion levels. SAFETEA directs DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels, maintain a database, and ensure effective program implementation. No direct funding is provided for the evaluation or the database. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million people were required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act to reach attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a population of 159 million people must comply with State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act. Federal agencies cannot fund projects in these areas unless they adhere to the SIP requirements, which aim to prevent new violations, worsen existing ones, or delay air quality standards attainment. Highway projects must also align with an area's Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) to address emissions concerns. The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) must demonstrate conformity with emissions requirements every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. The impact of conformity is expected to increase due to the growth of emissions from SUVs and light trucks, as well as higher than expected vehicle miles traveled. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years due to increased emissions from SUVs and light trucks, higher vehicle miles traveled, recent court decisions tightening conformity rules, and the implementation of more stringent air quality standards. This could lead to temporary suspension of highway and transit funds in numerous metropolitan areas. The next three years will see more stringent air quality standards, leading to additional areas facing conformity requirements. Metropolitan areas may risk losing highway and transit funds unless they reduce vehicle and industrial emissions. A 2003 survey by the Government Accountability Office found that only 5 areas had to change transportation plans in the past six years to meet conformity standards, but one-third of local planners anticipate difficulties in the future. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, and only a one-year grace period is permitted after an area is designated as nonattainment. Limited exempt projects, mainly safety-related or for existing transit facilities, are allowed. The Clean Air Act does not permit waivers of conformity and only allows a one-year grace period after an area is designated as nonattainment. Limited exempt projects, mostly safety-related or for existing transit facilities, are allowed. Concerns have been raised about funding restrictions for new projects that could reduce emissions and the need for better coordination between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles. The GAO recommended less frequent but better-coordinated demonstrations of conformity in its 2003 report. In 2003, the GAO recommended less frequent and better-coordinated conformity demonstrations between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles. This was supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. P.L. 109 - 59 enacted less frequent conformity requirements. The Clean Air Act was amended by P.L. 109 - 59 to require less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. This change was supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. The law also mandates consultation with local air pollution control agencies and solicitation of public comments before shortening the planning horizon. The Clean Air Act was amended to require less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. Consultation with local air pollution control agencies and public comments are required before shortening the planning horizon. A 12-month grace period is established following a failure to demonstrate conformity."
