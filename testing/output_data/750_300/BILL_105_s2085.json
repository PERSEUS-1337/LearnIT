    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The practice of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment. The National Labor Relations Act was enacted to protect the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Union organizers are now seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm. Employers should have the right to expect job performance regardless of employees' views on collective bargaining. Employers should have the right to expect job applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing their skills to further the goals of the business. The purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals who seek to disrupt the workplace. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who are not genuine job applicants seeking to further another employment or agency status. This amendment does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who are not genuine job applicants seeking to further another employment or agency status. This amendment does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act, including the right to self-organization, form labor organizations, bargain collectively, and engage in concerted activities for collective bargaining or mutual aid. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. SEC. 201. FINDINGS. Congress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case analysis, the NLRB has held hearings for decades on this issue, and a blanket rule limiting factors for determining bargaining unit appropriateness goes against the goal of promoting stability in labor relations. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. The Board will conduct a hearing to consider factors like functional integration and centralized control in making its determination. The Board will conduct a hearing to determine the appropriateness of the bargaining unit by considering factors such as functional integration, centralized control, common skills, working conditions, employee interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, number of employees, and bargaining history. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively leveled the playing field for these entities in their dealings with the Board. The National Labor Relations Board's greater expertise and resources compared to small businesses and labor organizations necessitate a standard that awards fees and costs to certain small entities when they prevail against the Board. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to costs, reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between them and the Board, and hold the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The purpose of this title is to make the National Labor Relations Board more accountable for its enforcement actions against small businesses and labor organizations by awarding fees and costs to these entities when they prevail. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs for employers or labor organizations who are prevailing parties in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board with specific criteria. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs for prevailing parties in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, without considering the justification of the Board's position. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section allowing employers or labor organizations with specific criteria to be awarded fees and expenses as prevailing parties in civil actions against the Board, without considering the justification of the Board's position. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow employers or labor organizations meeting specific criteria to be awarded fees and expenses as prevailing parties in civil actions against the Board, without considering the justification of the Board's position. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act specifies that the provisions regarding agency and court proceedings apply to cases initiated after the enactment of the Act."
