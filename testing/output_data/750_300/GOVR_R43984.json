However, they do not have complete control over their music, as demonstrated by Taylor Swift's music being available on Spotify through a cover version despite her withdrawal. Taylor Swift can withdraw her recorded music from Spotify, but cannot control how the service uses cover versions of her songs by other artists. Ms. Swift can remove her own music from Spotify, but cannot control how the service uses cover versions of her songs by other artists. The payment she receives for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and federal laws. Congress created these laws when music was primarily accessed through radio and physical media. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address music distribution on the internet, balancing combating piracy with protecting revenue sources in the music industry. It applied copyright provisions to digital services similar to radio broadcasts. The 1990s saw Congress updating copyright laws to address music distribution on the internet, balancing piracy prevention with industry revenue protection. Different copyright provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music distribution has since evolved, with streaming services blurring traditional lines of exploitation. The evolution of music consumption over the last 40 years has seen a shift from traditional methods to streaming services like Napster and iTunes. This has blurred the lines of exploitation in the industry. In 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store after negotiating licensing agreements with major record labels. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media in revenue, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, sales declined as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. After peaking in 2012, digital music downloads sales declined as streaming services like Spotify became more popular. Apple, with a 65% market share, launched Apple Music in 2015 to compete in the subscription streaming music service market. Subscription music services have significantly changed music consumption patterns in the U.S. according to the RIAA. The rise of music streaming services has transformed music consumption in the U.S. The proportion of total retail spending on music from various digital services increased from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Despite years of declining revenues, consumer spending on music remained flat in 2014-2015, grew 10% in 2015-2016, and 14% in 2016-2017. However, adjusted for inflation, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers is still significantly below 1999 levels. Consumer spending on music remained flat between 2014 and 2015, then increased by 10% in 2015-2016 and 14% in 2016-2017. Despite this growth, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers, adjusted for inflation, is still nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak. These changing consumption patterns impact how performers, songwriters, record companies, and music publishers are compensated for their work under copyright law. Under copyright law, creators of musical works and artists who record music license their rights to third parties to exercise on their behalf. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute copies to the public. The mechanical right in music publishing refers to the combination of reproduction and distribution rights, dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the right to mechanically reproduce musical compositions. The term \"mechanical rights\" in music publishing refers to the reproduction and distribution rights dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for reproducing musical compositions. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. The term \"mechanical rights\" in music publishing refers to reproduction and distribution rights. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly. This right applies to digital audio. The Copyright Act grants owners of musical works and sound recordings the right to publicly perform works, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. This includes services like webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services. Public performance rights for sound recordings under federal copyright laws are only granted to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Sound recording public performance rights under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on compact discs in a private setting, while record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works in physical formats. Listeners have the right to enjoy songs on CDs privately. Record labels pay music publishers for the distribution rights of musical works in physical formats. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major labels. Radio listeners have less control over song playback compared to owning the song. Broadcast radio stations are not required to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists under the Copyright Act. Broadcast radio stations do not have to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists under the Copyright Act. However, they are required to pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for broadcast music. Digital services must pay both record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Congress determined in 1995 that the promotional value of broadcast radio airplay outweighs any revenue lost by record labels and artists. In 1995, Congress concluded that the promotional value of broadcast radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights, including making temporary copies of songs. These temporary copies, known as \"ephemeral recordings,\" fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Users of on-demand music streaming services can listen to songs upon request by downloading digital files to their devices. These digital reproductions, known as conditional downloads, allow multiple listeners to select songs. The music industry involves three main categories: songwriters and music publishers, recording artists and record labels, and music licensees who obtain the right to reproduce and distribute music. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists by on-demand music streaming services for the right to distribute musical works and sound recordings. The music industry comprises three main categories: songwriters and music publishers, recording artists and record labels, and music licensees who reproduce, distribute, or perform music. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs and license intellectual property for royalties. Music publishers, also known as \"songwriters,\" promote songs to record labels and license intellectual property for royalties. They may provide advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music used in various formats. Music publishers help finance the songwriter's compositions by assigning a portion of the copyright. Their role includes monitoring, promoting, and generating revenue from music in various formats, such as sheet music, digital downloads, and broadcast radio. Publishers may contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers derive royalty income at each step, potentially sharing it with subpublishers. Music publishers often contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances on their behalf. Songwriters and publishers derive royalty income, which may need to be shared with subpublishers and coauthors. Contract terms for songwriters entering the music industry are typically standardized, with a 50-50 division of income between the publisher and songwriter. Some songs have multiple songwriters with their own publishers, complicating the division of money. Music publishers fall into four general categories, including major publishers that account for a significant portion of U.S. music publishing. Music publishers are categorized into major publishers, major affiliates, and independent publishers. The three major publishing firms, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group, account for over half of U.S. music publishing revenue. Independent publishing companies handle the creative aspects of songwriting management and affiliate with major publishers for royalty administration. Independent publishing companies handle the creative aspects of songwriting management and affiliate with major publishers for royalty administration. Writer-publishers may control their own publishing rights and hire individuals to administer their royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding musical talent, recording their work, and promoting the artists and their work. The parent companies of the three largest record labels reproduce and distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. Major labels have large distribution networks for moving physical recordings. The three largest record labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. They have large distribution networks for moving physical recordings and perform various functions related to selling digital copies, such as adding data for royalties and tracking payments. Record labels handle various functions related to selling digital copies of songs, including adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists may contract with a label or distribute their own recordings, often transferring copyrights for defined periods in exchange for services. Recording contracts require artists to transfer copyrights to record labels for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide artists' careers. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recordings. The three major labels earn about 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue. The three major record labels (Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group) earn about 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue. Each label shares a corporate parent with a major music publisher. Smaller record labels also exist in the industry. Music publishers like Sony Corporation, Vivendi SA, and Access Industries are discussed in \"Songwriters and Music Publishers.\" While smaller record labels exist, many rely on major labels for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, which has a distribution agreement with Universal Music Group. Chance the Rapper is a recording artist who retains his copyrights and distributes his own music without signing a contract with a record label. He gives his music away for free and earns money from touring and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for the exclusive rights to stream his album, Coloring Book, making it the first streaming-only album to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums in May 2016. A record producer is responsible for bringing the creative product into tangible form, involving creative tasks like selecting songs and administrative tasks like booking studios. In the past, record labels hired producers to produce entire albums. A record producer is responsible for creative tasks like selecting songs and administrative tasks like booking studios. Recording artists now work with multiple producers on a single album, controlling the terms of compensation. Producers may demand royalties if they have negotiating leverage. Sound engineers run recording sessions under producer oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. Producers with negotiating leverage may demand royalties. Sound engineers run recording sessions under producer oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. Mixers generally receive one-time payments per track, but those in high demand may receive a portion of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of the copyright owner to make mechanical reproductions of music. The 1909 Copyright Act granted the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. A mechanical license allows audio-only reproduction of music on devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and smartphones, for private use. Congress had concerns about player-piano allegations during the Act's consideration. The 1909 Copyright Act granted exclusive rights for making mechanical reproductions of music on devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and smartphones for private use. Congress established the first compulsory license to address concerns about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company. To prevent a potential monopoly by Aeolian Company, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allowed music publishers/songwriters to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording was distributed to the public, others could use it upon payment of a royalty. For example, in 2015, Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album 1989 without needing permission. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking her permission. Instead, he paid a compulsory mechanical license royalty rate set by the government. The 1909 Copyright Act established a royalty rate of $0.02 per \"part manufactured,\" which remained unchanged for nearly 70 years. Technological advancements in the first half of the 20th century allowed record manufacturers to increase the amount of music on each side of a record from 5 minutes to over 20 minutes. The compulsory mechanical license royalty rate was set at $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" by the 1909 Copyright Act, which remained unchanged for almost 70 years. Technological advancements in the first half of the 20th century allowed record manufacturers to increase the amount of music on each side of a record from 5 minutes to over 20 minutes. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976, specifying that rates would be payable for each record made and distributed, rather than each record manufactured. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying that rates are payable for each record made and distributed. Congress defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and set procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses through the Register of Copyrights. The 1976 Copyright Act established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music, requiring licensees to serve a notice of intention to the copyright owner or Copyright Office within 30 days of making a new recording. It also allowed copyright owners to sue without limitations on liability. The 1976 Copyright Act made it easier for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring potential licensees to provide a notice of intention or face ineligibility for a compulsory license. Failure to obtain a negotiated license can result in infringement under 17 U.S.C. Section 501. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue for infringement. Failure to obtain a negotiated license can result in infringement under 17 U.S.C. Section 501. The act removed the requirement for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" in the Copyright Office to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. This change means that copyright owners may not need to publicly disclose their identity to trigger certain requirements. Under current law, there may be no public record of the copyright owner triggering the NOI requirements for reproduction and distribution licenses. Controversy has arisen between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. Adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically was proposed in response to these issues. The controversy between rights holders and licensees over musical works led to proposals to adjust the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically. Suggestions for adjustments were made by representatives of the National Music Publishers Association in 1967 and by the Register of Copyrights in 1975 to simplify the administration of compulsory licenses. In 1975, Register of Copyrights Barbara Ringer proposed creating a separate royalty tribunal to simplify administering compulsory licenses. Congress established a tribunal in the 1976 Copyright Act, with four policy objectives for setting mechanical license rates. The 1976 Copyright Act established a tribunal to set mechanical license rates with four policy objectives, including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions, and minimizing industry disruption. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), established in 2004, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and other licenses. While voluntary negotiations are allowed, the CRB sets the statutory rates and terms. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), appointed by the Librarian of Congress, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and other licenses. The CRB-set rate acts as a ceiling for what an owner may charge. In 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA), amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. Rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries (DPDs) should distinguish between different types of digital phonorecord. The act amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. Rates for digital phonorecord deliveries should distinguish between incidental and general transmissions, sparking debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" The Copyright Office delayed rulemaking, urging Congress to resolve the issue. In July 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules on digital phonorecord deliveries, emphasizing the need for resolution in the music industry to survive in the 21st Century. Groups representing music publishers, the recording industry, songwriters, and music streaming services reached an agreement after years of administrative hearings and litigation. In September 2008, music industry groups reached a landmark agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming, ensuring publishers receive a percentage of revenues from interactive streams and limited downloads. This resolution is crucial for the industry's survival in the 21st Century. In 2009, music streaming services agreed to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive streaming services like Pandora were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. This agreement was modified in 2012 and set mechanical royalty rates for the industry. The CRB adopted a modified agreement in 2009, extended through 2012. In 2012, a new agreement was reached for music streaming services, covering rates until 2017. In 2018, mechanical royalty rates and terms were determined for 2018-2022. Licensees pay a flat rate for physical and digital music deliveries. In January 2018, the CRB issued initial mechanical royalty rates and terms for 2018-2022. For physical and digital music deliveries, licensees pay a flat rate based on song duration or playing time. Interactive streaming rates are calculated using formulas based on music service revenues. The CRB issued initial mechanical royalty rates and terms for 2018-2022, which are calculated based on music service revenues. The formulas determine the pool of money available for distribution to publishers, with rates setting minimum per-subscriber payments for interactive music services. During free trial periods, the mechanical royalty rate is zero. The mechanical royalty rate for interactive music services is zero during free trial periods. Public performance royalties are either overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897. In 1897, Congress granted songwriters the exclusive right to publicly perform their works. Establishments featuring orchestras, bands, operas, concerts, and musical comedies needed permission to perform these works. Copyright owners struggled to individually negotiate with every user due to the high number of public performances. To address this issue, composers formed a system to license and collect payment for public performances. In 1914, composers formed ASCAP to address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances. ASCAP is a performance rights organization that issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to publicly perform any musical works in ASCAP's catalog. PROs issue public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers, allowing licensees to perform musical works for a fee. SESAC was founded in 1930 as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties in the U.S. as broadcast radio gained popularity. In 1930, an immigrant musician founded a competing PRO, SESAC, to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. SESAC expanded its representation to include U.S. composers as broadcast radio grew in popularity. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on a percentage of each station's advertising revenues. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. Broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to strengthen bargaining power against ASCAP and attract new composers. BMI convinced publishers to switch from ASCAP. (GMR, a fourth PRO, was established in 2013.) BMI successfully convinced publishers previously affiliated with ASCAP to switch, and a fourth PRO, Global Music Rights (GMR), was established in 2013. ASCAP and BMI originally had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and prohibited direct licensing agreements. When the licensing agreement between ASCAP and radio stations expired in 1940, three-quarters of radio stations adopted a policy prohibiting the broadcast of songs by composers. When the five-year licensing agreement between ASCAP and radio stations expired in December 1940, three-quarters of radio stations prohibited broadcasting songs by ASCAP composers due to royalty rate disagreements. This led to a DOJ investigation into potential antitrust violations by PROs, resulting in BMI and ASCAP entering consent decrees in 1941. The DOJ investigated PROs for antitrust violations, leading to BMI and ASCAP entering consent decrees in 1941. The decrees required nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory terms for users, and open membership for songwriters and publishers. ASCAP and BMI must offer non-discriminatory licensing terms, accept all qualifying songwriters and publishers as members, and provide alternative licenses. If unable to agree on royalty rates, prospective licensees can seek a determination from federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York. ASCAP and BMI offer non-discriminatory licensing terms and accept all qualifying members. Royalty rates can be determined by federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York. SESAC and GMR negotiate rates based on marketplace agreements. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI must be deemed \"reasonable\" by the court. The rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations, while ASCAP and BMI must demonstrate \"reasonable\" rates approved by federal district court. ASCAP and BMI's market power is also considered. Judges cannot consider rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. The provision in 17 U.S.C. Section 114(i) prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was included in the 1995 DPRA to address concerns about how license fees for sound recordings could impact music performance royalties. According to a report of the House Judiciary Committee, Congress aimed to address concerns about how license fees for sound recordings could impact music performance royalties. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively, have been periodically reviewed by the DOJ for their operation and effectiveness. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively, have been periodically reviewed by the DOJ for their operation and effectiveness. In 2016, DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to DOJ's interpretation of the decrees. Congress enacted copyright laws specifically for sound recordings in 1971 with the Sound Recording Act, P.L. 92-140. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was created by Congress to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. It applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and was a response to the prevalence of audiotapes in the 1960s. The U.S. Supreme Court also ruled that federal copyright law did not preempt California's record piracy law for pre-1972 recordings. The 1971 Sound Recording Act addressed unauthorized duplications of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal copyright law did not preempt California's record piracy law for pre-1972 recordings. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. The U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve antipiracy laws. The House Judiciary Committee noted that without this exclusion, many works would enter the public domain. States can continue to protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which all state protection will be preempted. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws for copyright, exempting pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, when federal law will preempt state protection. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make server reproductions of sound recordings. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make ephemeral server reproductions of sound recordings. The rules for these licenses are similar to those for incidental reproduction and distribution of musical works under Section 115(c)(3)(C)(i). The rates and terms of the Section 112 license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive fees through SoundExchange. The Section 112 license rates and terms are determined by the CRB. SoundExchange handles the distribution of fees to copyright owners of sound recordings. Recording artists without copyrights do not receive Section 112 fees. Prior to the 1990s, record labels and artists mainly earned income from physical product sales like CDs. The emergence of the internet in the early 1990s raised concerns in the recording industry about the adequacy of existing copyright laws to protect their rights. In the early 1990s, record labels and artists earned income from physical product sales like CDs. The recording industry was concerned about copyright protection with the rise of the internet. Amendments to the Copyright Act in 1995 and 1998 addressed music piracy issues. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act granted exclusive public performance rights to record labels and artists for their sound recordings. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) of 1998 granted record labels and recording artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. This raised concerns among music publishers and writers about the potential impact on their ability to earn from public performance. The DPRA of 1998 granted record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for their sound recordings on digital audio services. Music publishers and writers were concerned about potential impacts on their ability to earn public performance royalties. The provision was a compromise between music publishers and record labels. After the DPRA's enactment, debates arose regarding whether nonsubscription streaming services were obligated to pay public performance royalties. After the DPRA's enactment, the Recording Industry Association of America and nonsubscription, advertising-supported, noninteractive streaming service providers debated whether the compulsory license applied to those services and if they were obligated to pay public performance royalties for sound recordings. A compromise was reached between RIAA and the Digital Music Association, leading to the adoption of the DMCA by Congress. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards for the CRB. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to different rates and terms. Webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to rates and terms that represent negotiated marketplace standards. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruptive impacts on industries and prevailing practices. This standard led to lower copyright rates according to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruptive impacts on industries and prevailing practices, including lower copyright rates. The DPRA allows owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with music streaming services for public performance rights. The DPRA enabled owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates, specifically for interactive services allowing individual arrangement of specific recordings. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 expressed concerns about certain subscription and interactive audio services potentially impacting sound recording sales and copyright owners' control over their work. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 expressed concerns that certain subscription and interactive audio services could harm sound recording sales and copyright owners' control. Interactive services pose the greatest threat to traditional record sales and livelihoods dependent on revenue from them. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 highlighted the impact of interactive audio services on traditional record sales and copyright control. Congress does not require broadcast radio stations to obtain public performance licenses for sound recordings. The committee aimed to balance the interests of various parties, acknowledging the benefits of airplay and promotional activities for sound recordings and performers. The radio industry has thrived with the use of prerecorded music, and the legislation should not disrupt this. The Senate Judiciary Committee distinguishes broadcast radio from other services, highlighting the benefits of airplay and promotional activities for performers. The legislation should not disrupt the mutually beneficial relationship between the radio industry and prerecorded music. The CRB sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. The process includes a three-month negotiation period, followed by written statements, discovery, and further negotiation attempts to reach a settlement. During rate-setting proceedings, parties have a three-month negotiation period. If no agreement is reached, written statements are submitted, discovery is conducted, and negotiations continue. Participants can reach agreements on statutory rates at any time and submit them to the CRB for review and potential adoption. The CRB has the option to decline adopting proposed rates as the basis for statutory terms and rates for non-participating parties. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) may adopt proposed rates or decline to do so, allowing for comments from affected parties. If no agreement is reached, live testimony is heard, and a determination is issued in the Federal Register. Participants can request a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of. In 2000, RIAA established SoundExchange as a common agent for record labels to receive royalties. SoundExchange became independent in 2003 and deducts costs before distributing payments. The CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates based on the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. Participants can challenge CRB determinations through a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. In 2003, RIAA spun off SoundExchange as an independent entity. SoundExchange deducts costs before distributing royalty payments. The CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates for online music services based on the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard, while preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services have percentage-of-revenue rates. Some music streaming services and webcasters complained about excessive per-performance rates ordered by the CRB. Following complaints about excessive per-performance rates set by the CRB, Congress passed the Webcaster Settlement Acts, allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes for music streaming services. This enabled services to pay royalties based on a percentage of their revenue instead of a per-performance rate. The CRB allowed music streaming services to pay royalties based on a percentage of their revenue instead of a per-performance rate. Agreements reached under this authority expired in 2015, and the CRB began setting royalty rates for 2016-2020. Questions arose during the rate proceeding about the impact of previous negotiated agreements. The CRB set royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. Disagreements arose over whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence in the rate proceeding, with SoundExchange arguing against it. The CRB rate proceeding involved a dispute over the use of direct agreements, including those based on the Pureplay settlement, as evidence. SoundExchange argued against their admissibility, citing a rule of exclusion in the Webcaster Settlement Act. Pandora Media and Clear Channel contended that disregarding these agreements would undermine the negotiation process. The CRB deemed these issues as novel material questions of substantive law. The CRB rate proceeding involved a dispute over the use of direct agreements, including those based on the Pureplay settlement, as evidence. SoundExchange argued against their admissibility, citing a rule of exclusion in the Webcaster Settlement Act. Pandora Media and Clear Channel contended that disregarding these agreements would undermine the negotiation process. The CRB determined that these were novel material questions of substantive law and referred them to the Register of Copyrights for resolution. In September 2015, the Register ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses that reflect provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. On December 16, 2015, the CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period. The CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period, setting streaming services' fees at $0.17 per 100 streams for 2016. Annual rate increases from 2017-2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees are set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties paid. The CRB sets streaming services' fees at $0.17 per 100 streams for 2016, with annual rate increases tied to the Consumer Price Index from 2017 through 2020. Ephemeral royalties fees are included with Section 114 royalties, set at 5% for the 2016-2020 period. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for the 2018-2022 period, with public performance rates varying based on music service type and rate-setting standards. The Copyright Act specifies how royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed. The Copyright Act specifies how royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed, with 50% going to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, and 2.5% each to agents representing nonfeatured musicians and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split for public performances by noninteractive digital services. The Copyright Act specifies royalty distribution for public performances of sound recordings by noninteractive digital services. 2.5% goes to agents representing nonfeatured musicians and vocalists, but record producers are not included in this split. Producers can be compensated through SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services in the Copyright Act has been debated, especially regarding how owners of sound recordings can set rates for public performance rights. Interactive services are defined as those that allow the public to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. (For more information on proposed legislation addressing producer compensation, refer to \"Bills Introduced in the 115th Congress.\") The Copyright Act distinguishes between interactive and noninteractive services, with interactive services allowing the public to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. This distinction is important for setting rates for mechanical licenses. The Copyright Act distinguishes between interactive and noninteractive services for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not considered interactive. This decision aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization. The court's decision on the distinction between interactive and noninteractive music services aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization by analyzing the predictability of song selection in interactive services. The court's decision focused on the predictability of song selection in interactive music services to prevent sales cannibalization. LAUNCHcast, an online radio service, was deemed noninteractive despite creating unique playlists for users. The court determined that LAUNCHcast, an online radio service offered by Launch Media, Inc., was noninteractive despite creating unique playlists for users. Noninteractive services must limit features to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. This includes not announcing in advance when specific songs, albums, or artists will be played. The Copyright Act limits features for music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio, such as not announcing in advance when specific songs will be played. The CRB-established rates do not differentiate between personalized services and others. Personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The CRB-established rates do not distinguish between customized services and other radio-style programming. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Users can listen for free with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening. Spotify offers on-demand access to songs and artists. Users can listen for free with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on both personal computers and mobile devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate royalty rates collectively with SiriusXM and other subscription services. The antitrust exemptions in 1995 allowed statutory licensees and copyright owners to designate common agents to negotiate royalty rates with SiriusXM and other subscription services. The House Judiciary Committee report emphasized that common agents must be nonexclusive to prevent copyright owners from demanding high rates. The DPRA allows for direct negotiation with copyright owners to secure a statutory license, preventing them from demanding high rates through common agents. For interactive services, the DPRA does not provide an antitrust exemption for rate negotiations, but common agents can be used for clearinghouse functions, not rate-setting. Section 112 of the DMCA addresses ephemeral server reproductions for webcasters and online services, along with providing antitrust measures. Section 112 of the DMCA allows copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating royalty payments for ephemeral recordings, with no specification on exclusivity. This contrasts with Section 114(e)(1) and includes an antitrust exemption. Section 112(e)(2) does not require designation on a nonexclusive basis, unlike Section 114(e)(1). The House Judiciary Committee report attributes this to following existing antitrust exemptions in copyright law. The CRB, established in 2004, includes provisions on licensee payments designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. The provision in Section 112(e)(2) requires licensees to make payments to the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges for royalties paid to a person other than the Copyright Office. This allows parties to continue making payments while appealing royalty decisions by the CRB. The House Judiciary Committee report noted that the provision in Section 112(e)(2) allows parties subject to statutory licensing to continue making payments while appealing royalty decisions by the CRB. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for collection and distribution of royalties. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for royalty collection. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. They argued it would benefit sound recording copyright owners, but the CRB cited Sections 112(e) and... Royalty Logic requested recognition as a \"designated agent\" to compete with SoundExchange for royalty collection. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are already designated agents according to the Copyright Act, and Royalty Logic does not need formal recognition. The CRB also stated that competition between multiple collectives may make sense in direct licensing but not in the royalty distribution process. The CRB argued against Royalty Logic's request to compete with SoundExchange for royalty collection, stating that multiple collectives may promote competition in direct licensing but not in the royalty distribution process. The CRB found that selecting a single collective is the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses. The CRB argued that selecting a single collective for royalty collection is the most efficient system under statutory licenses, a decision upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2009. Royalty Logic's argument against exclusive payment receivership was dismissed. The CRB argued for a single entity to receive royalty payments under statutory licenses, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Royalty Logic's argument against exclusive payment receivership was rejected by the court. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments for the statutory license, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single collective. No party requested multiple collectives, and SoundExchange was the only party seeking to be a collective for the period 2011-2014. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective by the CRB for the period 2011-2014. The CRB stated that a sole collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties under the statutory licenses' blanket licensing framework. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, which were approved by the CRB and made binding on all copyright owners and performers. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective by the CRB for the period 2011-2014 under the statutory licenses' blanket licensing framework. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, which were approved by the CRB and made binding on all copyright owners and performers. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting, monitoring, managing, and distributing sound recording royalties for the rate period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting, managing, and distributing sound recording royalties for the rate period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. In 2004, Congress extended the provision for negotiations and agreements related to traditional mechanical licenses. Owners and licenses must designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who distribute royalties to publishers and then to songwriters. The Harry Fox Agency, a major administrator, charges an administrative fee and distributes mechanical royalties to publishers, who then distribute them to songwriters. In 2015, SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency. Music publishers may also issue and administer mechanical licenses themselves. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licensing rate proceedings. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. Noncash considerations may be involved in mechanical licensing rate proceedings. Royalty Logic and copyright owners stipulated that Royalty Logic would not participate unless the issue regarding competition among collectives was raised by other parties in that rate proceeding. Noncash considerations may be involved in determining the price interactive services pay for access to music, such as major labels acquiring an 18% equity stake in Spotify. Sony sold a portion of its stake when Spotify began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2018. Sony sold a portion of its stake in Spotify when it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2018, sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by interactive services to music publishers are linked to those paid to record labels for performance rights, based on negotiated deals. The rates that interactive services pay music publishers are tied to the rates paid to record labels for performance rights, based on negotiated deals. This allows music publishers to participate in deals that include equity stakes or advertising revenues. Copyright law prohibits tying rates for public performances of musical works to rates for sound recordings. Concerns have been raised about fair sharing of payments from digital music services to music publishers and record labels. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of licensed songs in the US. Music publishers have alleged unfair sharing of performance royalty revenues from streaming services, claiming ASCAP and BMI consent decrees are not equitable. SESAC and Global Music Rights also play a role in performance rights licensing. Publishers can affiliate with multiple PROs, while songwriters can only choose one. Music publishers can affiliate with multiple PROs, while songwriters can only choose one. Publishers claim they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. In response, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for \"new media.\" In response to music publishers' claims of not receiving fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow publishers to license their public performance rights for \"new media.\" This change enabled publishers to negotiate directly with digital streaming services at market prices instead of rates overseen by federal courts. Pandora Media, Inc. challenged this partial withdrawal of rights in court. Pandora Media, Inc. challenged music publishers' partial withdrawal of rights in court, arguing that publishers must either have their song catalog \"all in\" or \"all out\" of the PRO. The courts ruled in favor of the publishers, stating that under the consent decrees, partial withdrawals were not allowed. As a result, major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to the consent decrees to permit partial grants of rights. The major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to the consent decrees to allow partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration for rate-setting, and bundled licenses. DOJ announced in June 2014 that it would evaluate the consent decrees, soliciting comments in 2015 on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" DOJ reviewed consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments on \"100% licensing\" vs \"fractional licensing\" in 2015. DOJ concluded in 2016 that consent decrees required 100% licensing, allowing any rights holder to issue a performance license without consent from others. The DOJ completed its review in 2016 and announced that the consent decrees required PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs, promoting competition. DOJ did not propose changes but suggested Congress reconsider copyright laws in the music industry. The DOJ completed its review in 2016, requiring PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs. Congress was urged to reconsider copyright laws in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit challenging the interpretation, leading to a ruling in favor of fractional licensing by Judge Stanton and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In September 2017, Judge Stanton ruled that BMI's consent decree allows fractional licensing, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in December 2017. Licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords and pay royalties. If the copyright owner is not identified, filing the NOI with the Copyright Office suffices. On April 12, 2016, the Copyright Office announced new procedures for filing Notices of Intention to reproduce and distribute musical works under Section 115. This allowed licensees to file NOIs in bulk electronic form, reducing filing costs significantly. Licensees, including Spotify, benefited from this change. The Copyright Office's procedural change reduced filing costs for filing NOIs for up to 100 songs at once. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the change. The licensees affirmed that they searched Copyright Office records and couldn't find copyright owners for the musical works. According to Billboard, digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in late 2015 to digitize the compulsory licensing process for proper compensation. Lawsuits were filed against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works, with some settled and others pending as of April 2018. The Music Modernization Act, passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018, aims to create a new nonprofit organization funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses for copyrighted musical works. The bill introduced in the House, including H.R. 4706, H.R. 1836, H.R. 3301, and H.R. 881, would create a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses for online music services and change the process of suing for infringement of mechanical licenses. The bill introduced in the House would extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, and create procedures for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers. Online music services could pay for a blanket mechanical license, and the Register of Copyrights would be required to implement the changes within nine months. The bill introduced in the House extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. Online music services can pay for a blanket mechanical license. The Register of Copyrights would designate a new nonprofit entity as a \"Mechanical Licensing Collective\" (MLC) and a new nonprofit entity as a \"digital licensee coordinator.\" The MLC would have a 17-member board. The bill introduces federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. Online music services can pay for a blanket mechanical license through a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). The MLC, with a 17-member board, will be funded by online music services through assessments reviewed by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB). The MLC's duties include maintaining a musical works database, offering blanket licenses, and collecting usage reports. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for maintaining a musical works database, administering blanket licenses, identifying musical works, locating copyright owners, and providing administrative services for voluntary licenses. The MLC would also engage in proceedings before the Copyright Office and the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB). The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for collecting and distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders, ensuring songwriters receive at least 50% of all royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would provide administrative services for voluntary licenses but cannot negotiate royalty rates or grant licenses for public performances of musical works. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for collecting and distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders, ensuring songwriters receive at least 50% of all royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would not negotiate royalty rates or terms, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in government lobbying activities. Authorized duties of the digital licensing coordinator include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, dues, enforcing payment obligations, and participating in proceedings before the CRB to establish assessment rates. The digital licensing collective is responsible for enforcing payment obligations, participating in proceedings to establish assessment rates, and maintaining records of activities. It is prohibited from engaging in government lobbying activities. Failure to provide monthly reports or royalties would result in default of the blanket license, with the option to seek review in federal district court. The licensing collective is prohibited from government lobbying activities. Failure to provide reports or royalties would result in default of the blanket license. An online music service can seek review in federal court if the collective improperly terminates a license. Copyright owners cannot sue a music service with a valid blanket license for infringement. The Music Modernization Act prohibits copyright owners from suing online music services with a valid blanket license for infringing reproduction and distribution rights. If a lawsuit is filed after January 1, 2018, the copyright owner can only recover royalties owed. The Music Modernization Act limits the recovery of damages for copyright infringement by online music services with a valid blanket license. The copyright owner can only recover royalties owed if certain requirements are met. The Music Modernization Act requires online music services to comply with specified requirements for identifying copyright owners. The CRB must use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard to set royalty rates for music reproduction and distribution. The Southern District of New York allows judges to consider sound recording public performance rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. This does not apply to broadcast radio stations. The current system assigns judges in this district to oversee cases related to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. The current system of assigning judges in the Southern District of New York to oversee cases related to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees would change. A random process would determine which judge hears rate setting cases, and original judges overseeing consent decree interpretation would not oversee rate proceedings. The district court would use a random process to assign judges for rate setting cases, excluding original judges overseeing consent decree interpretation. This change is based on the belief that rate decisions should be randomly assigned to judges not involved in the consent decrees. Sound recording creators from certain dates would receive payments from digital music services for public performances. Creators of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, but after January 1, 1923, are entitled to payments from digital music services for public performances. This entitlement is in addition to legal remedies like damages and attorney's fees, and rights owners must file specific information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees for pre-1972 sound recordings. The bill provides federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings, requiring rights owners to file information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. The Copyright Office will issue regulations for filing sound recording identification and contact information by licensees of sound recording public performance. The bill provides federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings, requiring rights owners to file information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The entity distributing royalties must be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB, adopting a policy for distributions. The CRB requires a nonprofit collective designated by them to distribute royalties for pre-1972 sound recordings. The collective must have a letter of direction from a featured artist and adopt a policy for distributions. This modifies 17 U.S.C. \u00a7114(g) by replacing \"agent\" with \"nonprofit collective designated by the CRB.\" Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalty receipt. The CRB requires a designated collective for royalty distribution of pre-1972 sound recordings. Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalty receipt. Legislators introduced resolutions in support of the music industry, opposing new fees on local radio stations for sound recordings. Michael Conaway introduced H.Con.Res. 13, Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, which opposes new fees on local radio stations for sound recordings. Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, giving copyright owners the right to withdraw their music from broadcast radio stations. The PROMOTE Act of 2017, H.R. 1914, would grant copyright owners of sound recordings the exclusive right to remove their music from broadcast radio stations. Stations can play music without permission if they pay royalties or if the broadcast falls under specific exemptions. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, which aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. This bill would also limit remedies for copyright owners who do not provide necessary information for the database. The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, introduced by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, aims to establish a Copyright Claims Board as an alternative forum for copyright owners to address infringement issues. Participation would be voluntary, with jurisdiction limited to civil copyright cases capped at $30,000 in damages. Senator Ron Wyden also introduced the Accessibility for Curators in May 2018. The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017 aims to establish a Copyright Claims Board for owners to protect their work from infringement. Senator Ron Wyden introduced the ACCESS to Recordings Act in May 2018, providing federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. The ACCESS to Recordings Act of 2018 provides federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, allowing rights holders to receive payments from digital services for public performances. During a limited three-year window, pre-1972 sound recording copyright owners must give timely notice of infringement to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees. The ACCESS to Recordings Act of 2018 provides federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. Owners must give timely notice of infringement to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees. Sound recordings made prior to this date would enter the public domain either 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Sound recordings made between 1923 and 1930 are protected until December 31, 2025, if the copyright owner engages in commercial exploitation, complies with regulations, and notifies the Register of Copyrights. If requirements are not met, recordings enter the public domain."
