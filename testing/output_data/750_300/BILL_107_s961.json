According to findings by Congress, an estimated 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. In 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that in 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. From 1985 to January 2000, the FDA received 127,770 adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled implants. Women need complete and accurate information about the potential health risks and advantages of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone breast implants were never FDA approved; saline breast implants, approved in 2000, have high complication rates. Women require accurate information on breast implant risks for informed decisions. In 2000, saline breast implants were approved by the FDA despite high complication rates. After three years, a significant percentage of patients experienced local complications and required additional surgeries. FDA investigated manipulation of research data by a breast implant manufacturer in 1998. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates and the need for additional surgeries. A manufacturer was investigated for manipulating research data in 1998, but the investigation remains open. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000, but was not informed of ongoing investigations. Studies show high complication rates, with 1 in 4 women needing additional surgery within 5 years. Research found that 70% of women had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. In 2000, FDA research found that 70% of women with silicone breast implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migration in 21% of cases. The relationship between free silicone and disease progression is unknown. A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. found a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with silicone breast implants, suggesting serious implications from their use. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study also addressed silicone implants. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study highlighted that silicone breast implants are not benign and may lead to serious complications, particularly local issues. Concerns persist about potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases resulting from exposure to silicone implants. Complications and concerns about silicone breast implants include higher rates of lung and brain cancer in recipients, as well as evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured implants. A 1999 case report by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured silicone breast implants, leading to severe local inflammation and complications. Once silicone gel leaves the implant, it can elicit profound pathologic responses. According to reports, silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms, masking up to 40% of breast tissue and delaying breast cancer detection in women. Additionally, a 2000 FDA publication noted concerns for women of childbearing age who wish to breastfeed. According to a 2000 FDA publication, breast implants can mask 40% of breast tissue, potentially delaying breast cancer detection in women. Concerns exist for women of childbearing age who want to breastfeed due to unknown effects of silicone passing into breast milk. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants and ensure accurate information is provided to women. It also aims to address concerns about silicone passing into breast milk and potential effects on nursing infants. The Act aims to regulate implant manufacturers to protect the health of American women. It does not affect existing regulations on silicone breast implants for reconstruction or correction purposes. The Act requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. Additionally, a new section on breast implant research is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH appoints a Department of Health and Human Services official as the coordinator for breast implant research at the National Institutes of Health, overseeing research participation from various Institutes. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research at the National Institutes of Health, overseeing research participation from various Institutes including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Cancer Institute. Study sections or special emphasis panels are established for extramural research grant review. The Director of NIH establishes study sections or special emphasis panels to review extramural research grant applications on breast implants. The Director also conducts or supports research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants. The Director of NIH conducts or supports research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study on women with breast implants for at least eight years. The study differentiates between women receiving implants for mastectomy, reconstructive, or cosmetic purposes. A study on women with breast implants for at least eight years should focus on local complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture, as well as atypical symptoms, silicone migration, and immune system irregularities. It should also evaluate their health compared to suitable controls. The study on women with breast implants should focus on complications like capsular contracture, leakage, rupture, silicone migration, and immune system irregularities. It should also evaluate their health compared to suitable controls. The Director of NIH will submit an annual report to Congress on the study results. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding silicone breast implants at the FDA. The FDA will expedite the conclusion of a criminal investigation into a breast implant manufacturer, brief Congress on the findings, and ensure up-to-date consumer information on breast implants. The Act requires manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information. The Act mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information, including local complications and rupture rates. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies must provide patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and amend study protocols accordingly. The Act mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information. Clinical investigators must provide prospective patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and amend study protocols to ensure patients receive informed consent documents at the initial consultation. Additionally, the informed consent protocol should inform women about obtaining a Medwatch form and encourage those who withdraw from the study to do so. The Act mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information. Clinical investigators must provide prospective patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and amend study protocols to ensure patients receive informed consent documents at the initial consultation. Additionally, appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to inform women about obtaining a Medwatch form and provide inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel annually to review breast implant information and advertisements for accuracy, including saline and silicone breast implant recipients. The administration ensures accurate consumer information by including a diverse membership of saline and silicone breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with clinical care and research experience."
