The growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and contributing to traffic congestion near major U.S. international gateways. Between 2000 and 2005, the value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with the number of containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. The value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Existing and potential trade agreements suggest further growth in international trade and freight congestion. The US is a member of the World Trade Organization, has 11 free trade agreements, and is negotiating 4 more. Traffic congestion in United States cities is worsening, leading to Americans wasting billions of hours in traffic and spending billions of dollars on extra fuel costs annually. The US is actively involved in international trade, with multiple free trade agreements in place and negotiations ongoing with various countries and organizations. Traffic congestion in US cities is escalating, resulting in Americans wasting 4.2 billion hours in traffic and buying 2.9 billion extra gallons of fuel annually, costing $78 billion. Over 200 freight bottlenecks cause $8 billion in economic losses and 243 million hours of delay each year. To maintain current transportation conditions, $235 billion was invested in 2006 by all levels of government. To maintain current transportation conditions and traffic levels, government investments of $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and $472 billion in 2030 are required. To improve conditions for economic productivity, investments of $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 are needed. To enhance the Nation's economic productivity through transportation system improvements, government investments of $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 are necessary. The Act aims to address transportation investment needs in national trade gateway corridors and reduce freight congestion along trade routes affected by international trade growth.
