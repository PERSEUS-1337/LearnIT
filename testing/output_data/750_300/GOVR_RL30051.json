    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. Action on 451 installations scheduled for closure and realignment by previous BRAC commissions was completed by FY2001. The 451 installations scheduled for closure and realignment by previous BRAC commissions were completed by the end of FY2001, producing net savings of about $16.7 billion. Additional base closures were deemed necessary due to the downward trend in defense spending and force structure. The 1995 round of base closures produced net savings of about $16.7 billion. In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of closures in 1999 and 2001 due to the downsizing of DOD's base structure lagging behind its force structure. Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 to address the imbalance between the downsizing of DOD's base structure and force structure. He emphasized the need for further closures to achieve a proper balance and significant savings. Secretary of Defense William Cohen proposed two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 to address the imbalance between infrastructure and force structure. He highlighted the need for closures to achieve savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Despite his plan, there was reluctance from Capitol Hill due to concerns over economic impacts. DOD faces challenges in fulfilling future missions. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan for new base closures in 1999 and 2001 was met with resistance on Capitol Hill. Concerns over economic and political fallout led to a lack of support from defense committees. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve the proposal for two more rounds of base closures. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve a proposal for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001. Senator Carl Levin and other senators pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. However, the full Senate voted against the initiative and supported a substitute amendment. Senator Levin emphasized the need to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate voted against the McCain-Levin initiative and supported a substitute amendment that delayed new base closings until DOD developed accurate cost/savings measurement techniques. The substitute amendment required DOD to submit a timely cost/savings report to Congress. Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Trent Lott, and Senator Tom Daschle sponsored a provision requiring DOD to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner for possible base closings in 2001. Representative Joel Hefley opposed new base closure rounds for at least five years and questioned DOD's savings estimates. Representative Joel Hefley, chairman of the subcommittee on military installations, opposes new base closure rounds for at least five years. He questions DOD's estimated savings, citing substantial upfront costs of shutting down bases. Congressional Budget Office unable to confirm DOD's savings estimates. Congressional opponents want a thorough understanding of military implications before rushing into new closure rounds. The Congressional Budget Office could not confirm or assess the estimates for new base closure rounds. Congressional opponents questioned rushing into closures without understanding military implications. Despite lack of support, senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new closures. Senior DOD officials and the President continued to advocate for new rounds of base closures despite lack of broad support on Capitol Hill. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for base closures to free up funds for weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included plans for base closures in 2001 and 2005 to achieve annual savings. The Defense Reform Initiative announced by senior Pentagon officials included plans for two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming to save $2.8 billion annually through various cost-cutting measures. The Defense Reform Initiative announced plans for base closures, outsourcing, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for base closures came from a 1997 report urging quick action. The DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel urged Congress and the Defense Department to quickly restore the base realignment and closure process, calling for closures to begin earlier than the current 2001-2005 proposal. Secretary of Defense Cohen endorsed the panel's findings, emphasizing the importance of two additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. President Clinton's actions regarding the last base closure round were highly contentious. President Clinton opposed the 1995 base closure commission's recommendation to close two Air Force maintenance depots, arguing that significant savings could be achieved by transferring workloads to remaining depots in Utah, Oklahoma, and Georgia. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly depots, advocating for privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas. Critics accused him of political meddling in the base closure process. President Clinton's proposal to prevent job losses in California and Texas through privatization-in-place faced opposition from legislators in Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah. They believed the plan deprived their local populations of job opportunities created under the initial recommendation of the 1995 base closure commission. Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan, fearing job losses and vulnerability to base closures. Resentment over President Clinton's intervention in 1995 persisted among some Members until the end of his second term, influencing their opposition to new base closure rounds. President Clinton's 1995 intervention continued until the end of his second term, leading to opposition from some congressional members to new base closure rounds. An amendment in 1997 blocked the privatization of depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases unless the Secretary of Defense certified that other depots were operating at 80% capacity. The House National Security Committee approved a bill prohibiting privatization at two depots unless other depots were operating at 80% capacity. The Senate Armed Services Committee also approved similar depot language. However, depot-related provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill due to a threatened filibuster. Representative Terry Everett led an effort to delete the depot-related restrictions in floor debate on June 23, 1997. The depot-related provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill after a filibuster by Senators from California and Texas. Representative Terry Everett's attempt to delete the restrictions in the House bill was defeated. Senator Inhofe tried to restore the restrictions in the Senate bill but withdrew the amendment before floor consideration. The depot-related language in the House bill caused contention in the conference committee. In the conference committee, the depot-related language in the House bill was a major obstacle to reaching a final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill. As of early October, it was the only remaining issue to be resolved, with opposing camps unwilling to yield. One side threatened filibuster and/or veto if public-private depot competition at certain air force bases was not allowed, while the other side insisted that without language prohibiting depot competition, there would be no bill. The Senate and House conferees reached a resolution on the FY1998 defense authorization bill on October 23 (H.Rept. 105-340). The compromise agreement increased the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%. Additionally, a broader definition of \"core work\" to be done by government depots was included to balance out the benefits to private contractors. The House passed the conference agreement on October 28. The House passed the conference report on the FY1998 defense authorization bill on October 28 by a vote of 286 to 123.

President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), which included language prohibiting DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. The Dorgan Amendment prohibited DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. The detailed requirements included ten \"Elements\" and eight \"Methods of Presenting Information.\" The report was due by January-February 1999, but was submitted early on April 2, 1998 by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense submitted a report to Congress on base closure and realignment legislation, emphasizing the need for new rounds of closings to address excess base structure. Secretary of Defense Cohen highlighted the importance of savings for modernization of weapons systems and readiness, pointing out discrepancies in budget and force structure reductions. The Department of Defense emphasized the need for new rounds of base closures to address excess base structure. Secretary of Defense Cohen highlighted the significant imbalance between force and base structures, citing examples such as the reduction in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to base facilities. The base closure report highlighted the planned reductions in Army soldiers and classroom space, with closure costs of previous rounds being lower than estimated. The Department of Defense expected net total savings of about $14 billion through 2001 from the shutdown of bases and facilities during BRAC's 1988-1995 rounds. The base closure report projected savings exceeding initial estimates, with DOD expecting $14 billion in net total savings through 2001 and $5.6 billion annually thereafter. The Pentagon anticipated additional savings of $3 billion per year from the 2001 and 2005 closure rounds. CBO and GAO were tasked with reviewing the report's accuracy and reliability. The Pentagon sought two new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005 to save $3 billion annually. CBO and GAO were to review the report's findings. DOD recommended applying previous base closure models and highlighted successful economic recovery in impacted communities. An Air Force memo further fueled controversy over base closures. The Pentagon proposed two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to save money. A memo from the Air Force sparked controversy by suggesting White House involvement in keeping depot maintenance work at certain bases. Members accused the Administration of meddling in the closure process. Members strongly opposed keeping depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, accusing the Administration of interference in the closure process. Capitol Hill reacted with widespread resistance to the proposal for new base closure rounds, with the House National Security Committee adamantly against any closings in the near future. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the proposal for new base closure rounds, with widespread resistance from the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate committee defeated a proposed new round of base closures in 2001 by a 10-8 margin. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin, co-sponsors of new BRAC legislation, indicated their opposition. In a mark-up session, the Senate committee rejected a proposed new round of base closures in 2001 by a 10-8 margin. Senators John McCain and Carl Levin, who were co-sponsors of previous BRAC legislation, considered seeking support for a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. However, they abandoned their initiative as the majority sentiment was against them. The Senate abandoned their initiative for a new round of base closures in 2001 after facing majority opposition. An amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, aimed to make it harder for the Pentagon to close bases with a certain number of civilian personnel. The Inhofe amendment aimed to make it more difficult for the Pentagon to close bases with a certain number of civilian personnel, reducing the threshold from 300 to 225 employees. It also restricted the Pentagon from realigning bases with 750 or more civilian personnel, and prevented base closures within four years of a realignment. The amendment was intended to delay or block base closures by reducing the number of civilian employees. The Inhofe amendment aimed to delay or block base closures by reducing the number of civilian employees to less than 225. It also expressed opposition to new rounds of closures until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office found that DOD's base realignment and closure report provided most, but not all, requested information. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding that most requested information was provided. DOD's estimates of savings were consistent with CBO's estimates, with BRAC savings being avoided costs that cannot be observed as actual expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, noting that BRAC savings are avoided costs that cannot be measured as actual expenditures. DOD can only estimate savings, as future base closure rounds are expected to produce significant savings. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, highlighting the lack of analysis on potential base closures and the difficulty in assessing the impact on local communities. DOD also faced challenges in locating requested data, affecting the accuracy of BRAC cost and savings estimates. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, providing more detail than the CBO review. GAO gave DOD good grades for providing most of the required information for BRAC. The GAO review of DOD's base realignment and closure report on November 13, 1998, provided more detail than the CBO review. GAO gave DOD generally good grades, noting that DOD's report was a rough approximation of costs and savings, with incomplete data systems for tracking BRAC savings. The GAO review of DOD's base realignment and closure report in 1998 highlighted that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings from BRAC actions. DOD's analysis showed no long-term issues affecting military capabilities due to BRAC actions, and communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. Some communities are faring better than others. The DOD's report on base realignment and closure actions shows that communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically, with some communities faring better than others. The report suggests that proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. The legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a basis for future legislation if Congress decides to authorize more rounds. The issue of authorizing new base closings was a significant concern for Congress at the start of the 106th Congress.

The bill included changes to the BRAC selection process to allow for a new President to nominate members for base closure. Senator John McCain and his cosponsors proposed two significant changes in the law for base closings in 2001 and 2003. The BRAC selection process would start and end two months later in 2001, allowing a new President to nominate commission members. Privatization-in-place would not be allowed unless recommended by the new base closure commission. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the need for further base closures in early 1999. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures in early 1999, stating that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was hindering military readiness. He highlighted that the savings from additional base closures would amount to $20 billion during implementation and generate $3 billion annually thereafter.

The Secretary of Defense must provide an inventory of military installations, analyze options for reducing excess infrastructure, and certify the need for closure or realignment with annual net savings within six years. Military value is the primary consideration for recommendations. The commission will increase its members from 8 to 9. The Secretary of Defense must certify the need for closure or realignment with annual net savings within six years. Military value is the primary consideration for recommendations. The commission will increase its members from 8 to 9 and allow the Secretary of Defense to testify on proposed base additions. Privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases is prohibited unless recommended by the commission. In 1997, the Department of Defense announced the need for two more closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure, despite little enthusiasm from Congress. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld finally gained approval in 2001.

Communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations and are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to keep their military units/functions at home. Communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations. Strategies are being developed to keep military units at home or acquire units from other parts of the country to ensure a base's survival. Range encroachment is a serious concern as bases are hemmed in by urban growth and other factors. The impact of \"range encroachment\" on military bases is a serious concern for communities. Urban growth, competition for air space, and protection of endangered species are factors that may de-value bases and make them prime candidates for closure in 2005. In 2005, military bases may face closure due to factors like urban growth and protection of endangered species. The process involves the President sending nominations by a required date, Congress having 45 days to pass a motion of disapproval, or the Commission's list becoming law."
