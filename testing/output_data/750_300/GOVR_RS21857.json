Its foreign investment policy aims to benefit both the U.S. and foreign investors, with considerations for national security risks. The Trump Administration has not yet outlined its specific foreign investment policy. The Trump Administration has not provided a formal statement on its foreign investment policy, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross mentioned at a summit in June 2017 that the Administration welcomes foreign investment in the U.S. The global inward foreign direct investment position in the United States was around $6.4 trillion in 2016, according to the United Nations. The United States welcomes foreign investment, with a global inward foreign direct investment position of $6.4 trillion in 2016. Other countries with large inward investment positions include Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland. The Commerce Department publishes data on U.S. direct investment positions. In 2016, the United States had a global inward foreign direct investment position of $6.4 trillion, with other countries like Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland also having significant inward investment positions. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment positions: historical cost, current cost, and market value. These measures represent the value of an investment at the time of the investment, the current replacement cost, and the stock market valuation, respectively. In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion at historical cost and current cost. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value, $4.0 trillion at current cost, and $3.5 trillion at historical cost. Figure 2 shows the cumulative position for USDIA and FDIUS in market value terms. Total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value in 2016. The United Kingdom and Japan compete as the largest foreign direct investors in the U.S. economy. The drop in FDI in 2014 was due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone.

U.S. foreign investment policy has historically supported foreign direct investment, with exceptions for national security concerns. Since World War II, U.S. foreign investment policy has promoted foreign direct investment, but national security concerns have led to increased restrictions on foreign investment in various countries. The United States addresses national security concerns related to foreign acquisitions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multiagency process. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees foreign investment in U.S. firms to assess national security threats. The President can block transactions that pose a risk to national security, especially those involving foreign government control or critical infrastructure. The President has the authority to block foreign investment transactions that threaten national security. The CFIUS process is voluntary but leaves firms vulnerable to future review and possible divestiture if they do not notify CFIUS. In a report to Congress, CFIUS stated that 42% of notified foreign investment transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in the manufacturing sector.

The presence and investment activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) owned or controlled by foreign governments are raising concerns over economic and security implications. Approximately 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are now effectively under state control, according to the OECD. Policymakers worry that preferential treatment given to SOEs may create competitive advantages and anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. Policymakers are concerned about governments favoring state-owned enterprises (SOEs), potentially giving them a competitive edge in global markets. Close associations between firms and governments could blur the line between commercial activities and state support, leading to unfair advantages for SOEs. Some policymakers worry that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may blur the line between commercial activities and state support, potentially compromising national security objectives. Conversely, others argue that SOEs protected by their governments may lack the incentives to become competitive in the long run. The OECD found little evidence that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have a significant impact on their international economic performance.

The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned counterparts presents a mixed picture. The performance of foreign-owned establishments in the United States compared to their U.S.-owned counterparts presents a mixed picture, with historically lower rates of return for foreign-owned firms. However, the gap between the two groups appears to have narrowed over time, possibly due to age effects and startup costs. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the gap in performance between foreign-owned and U.S.-owned manufacturing firms has narrowed over time. Foreign-owned firms outperform their U.S. counterparts with significantly higher value added and shipments, despite accounting for less than 3% of all establishments. The average plant size for foreign-owned firms is six times larger than for other establishments. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. account for less than 3% of establishments but have significantly higher value added and shipments compared to other establishments.

Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. have larger plant scales and newer plant ages, paying 60% higher wages on average than other U.S. manufacturing firms. They also exhibit 40% higher productivity per worker and 58% greater output per worker. Additionally, foreign-owned firms show higher capital intensity across various industries compared to all U.S. establishments. It is important to note that the comparison between foreign-owned and U.S.-owned firms may not be entirely accurate due to differences in firm sizes and compositions. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. should be viewed with caution as they are primarily large firms with proven technologies, while U.S. firms span a broader range of sizes. Small foreign ventures with unproven technologies are unlikely to invest overseas. Foreign investors tend to opt for lower risk investments. Foreign direct investment in the United States in 2015 increased significantly compared to 2013, driven by a growing U.S. economy and rising equity values. Foreign investors in the U.S. are typically large firms with proven technologies, opting for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. Small foreign ventures with unproven technologies are unlikely to invest overseas due to added risks. Foreign direct investment in the United States in 2015 saw a sharp increase, driven by a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows rose by 38% to $1.7 trillion in 2015, but have not yet reached pre-financial-crisis levels.

Global direct investment inflows in 2007 were at $2.0 trillion, but have not yet recovered to pre-financial-crisis levels. In 2015, many regions in Africa and Latin America saw a slowdown in foreign direct investment, with economies in transition experiencing a 38% decrease. As the U.S. economy grows relative to other advanced economies, interest rates remain low, and inflation stays in check, foreign direct investment in the U.S. is expected to increase. Estimates suggest that foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may slightly surpass 2015 levels based on data from the first three quarters of 2016. If interest rates remain low and inflation stays in check, foreign direct investment in the United States is expected to increase. Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and the economy may influence public perception of foreign direct investment, with a focus on potential job losses rather than international competitiveness. Concerns over foreign direct investment in the United States focus on potential job losses rather than international competitiveness. Job security is a significant public issue, with opposition to some types of foreign direct investment stemming from concerns about its impact on jobs. Foreign direct investment in the United States is viewed positively due to the benefits of capital inflow and job creation. However, concerns about its impact on U.S. economic and national security interests persist, especially after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Despite national security complications, the U.S. economy remains a top destination for foreign direct investment. Despite national security concerns, foreign investors continue to see the U.S. economy as a prime destination for investment. With the nation's economic growth outpacing foreign economies, foreign direct investment is expected to increase as new investments are attracted to the United States and existing firms reinvest profits in their U.S. operations."
