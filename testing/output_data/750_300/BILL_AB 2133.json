    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers in California is a priority as it will also benefit the children under their care by creating a safer and healthier environment. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they are not covered by workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them and the children in their care to receive proper training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to address these concerns. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to require the annual publication of lists covering licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes. The lists will detail the services offered, licensed capacity, and licensing authority of each facility. Additionally, measures will be taken to protect the privacy of small family day care homes. The amendment to Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code requires the publication of lists of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes. The lists will include services offered, licensed capacity, and licensing authority. Privacy of small family day care homes will be protected. Names and addresses of small family day care homes will be shared for specific purposes like licensing administration and child placement. The entity selected to provide trainings required by Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services that include child care referral services. Parents seeking local day care services can receive information on local small family day care providers upon request. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. Regulations will ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program exempt from licensing, excluding relatives of the children in care. A publicly funded child care program subsidizes early learning and care for children, administered by various state departments or agencies, excluding the K-12 public education system. A family child care provider must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession to protect their own health and safety and that of the children in their care. The State Department of Social Services requires family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training prioritizes licensed providers and includes identifying and minimizing chemical and biological hazards in a child care setting. The training sessions for family child care providers include discussing risks like chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also involves small and large group discussions and learning from current child care professionals. The training sessions for family child care providers cover chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, physical hazards, group discussions, learning from professionals, presentations by relevant organizations, and feedback opportunities for providers. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The selected entity must have experience in this training, train providers to give the required training to others, and provide updates on health and safety matters to trained providers. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The entity will train providers to give required training to others, provide updates on health and safety matters, and develop curriculum approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The State Department of Social Services will administer the training contract. The State Department of Social Services will administer the contract with the selected entity for providing training to family child care providers. The training will be coordinated with other preservice requirements to reduce the burden on providers. (g) The department will provide lists of family child care providers who have attended training and those who still need to attend, along with their contact information, to the training entity. The entity will use this information to send updates on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their home address and telephone number removed from the lists before they are shared. The department and training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. This section of the act will be effective on July 1, 2017 and does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Legislature aims to establish the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to report violations to the State Department of Education. A new section 8221.6 is added to the Education Code. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints for non-compliance with laws or regulations. This includes programs like the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, and CalWORKs Stage 3 Program. Alternative payment programs include the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program. The operation of these programs is dependent on annual budget appropriations or other statutes."
