    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, with over 190,000 new diagnoses and 27,000 deaths in 2009. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer, and younger men are also at risk. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the disease. Prostate cancer is a significant concern among men, with younger individuals also at risk. Racial and ethnic disparities exist, with African-Americans having double the mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations face higher mortality rates, and utilizing telehealth can improve access to quality care. Underserved rural populations have higher mortality rates compared to urban areas. Telehealth can be used to improve access to quality care for prostate cancer. Urologists play a key role in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients. Despite advancements in research, there are still unanswered questions about the disease. Prostate cancer research has provided much knowledge, but there are still unanswered questions regarding disease disparities, causes, and accurate differentiation between aggressive and indolent forms, leading to significant overtreatment. (9) The causes of prostate cancer are unknown, making it difficult to differentiate between aggressive and indolent forms early on, leading to significant overtreatment. Treatments cannot cure prostate cancer once it has metastasized. (10) Up to 54 percent of cases may be overdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary treatment. Improved tests can help reduce physical and emotional burden on patients and their families. Improved tests for prostate cancer can help reduce unnecessary treatment and the physical, emotional, and financial burden on patients and their families. This can also lead to significant cost savings in healthcare systems.
