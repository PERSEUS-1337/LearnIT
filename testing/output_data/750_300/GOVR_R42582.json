    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean reflects the diversity of the region, with some countries still receiving aid due to ongoing challenges, while others have largely outgrown U.S. assistance but receive support for new security challenges. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean has evolved as countries make progress in democratic governance and economic development. While some nations have outgrown U.S. aid, they still receive support for new security challenges like citizen security and combating organized crime. Despite this progress, foreign aid continues to play a role in advancing U.S. policy in the region, with Congress overseeing aid programs and appropriations. Foreign aid remains crucial for advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress oversees aid programs and appropriations, especially in light of efforts to reduce budget deficits. Spending cuts are being considered, leading to closer scrutiny of the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. aid programs. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, examining historical and recent aid trends. It also details the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for State Department and USAID-related assistance in the region, amidst potential spending cuts and budget constraints. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with aid increasing in the early 1960s. The Obama Administration's FY2013 request for State Department and USAID-related assistance to the region is examined, along with support from other U.S. agencies. Key funding provisions in the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bills for Latin America and the Caribbean are also discussed. The United States has a history of providing foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with aid increasing in the early 1960s due to President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress. Assistance to the region also rose in the 1980s following the leftist Sandinistas assuming power in Nicaragua. US support was provided to the Contras during this time. After a period of decline, U.S. assistance to Latin America increased following the 1979 Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, the United States supported the Contras in their efforts to overthrow the Sandinista government and aided Central American governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Aid flows decreased in the mid-1990s after the end of Soviet Union, Central American conflicts, and the spread of democracy. However, U.S. foreign assistance to the region began to rise again in the late 1990s and continued to increase. In the late 1990s, U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased, driven by higher levels of humanitarian and development aid. This was partly in response to the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Additionally, initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2004 contributed to the rise in assistance. In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the United States provided extensive humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Central America. Initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC in the early 2000s offered new sources of U.S. assistance to the region. The Obama Administration focused on promoting economic growth and requested higher aid levels for development. Significant assistance was also given to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The United States provided aid to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, with a focus on counternarcotics and security programs in Colombia and its Andean neighbors through \"Plan Colombia\". Since the 106th Congress in FY2000, substantial foreign aid has been provided to Colombia and its Andean neighbors in support of \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and internal armed conflict. Additional assistance was given in FY2008 through the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico and Central America, and in FY2010, the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) was created. The M\u00e9rida Initiative was announced as U.S. assistance for Mexico and Central America, later split into CARSI for Central America and CBSI for the Caribbean. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been declining since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in assistance from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. U.S. aid to various regions saw changes with a 10% decrease in Latin America and the Caribbean, declines in East Asia, the Pacific, and Europe, but increases in South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. This shift reflects evolving global conditions and U.S. foreign policy priorities towards development in Africa and strategic anti-terrorism efforts. The United States has shifted its resources towards development efforts in Africa and strategic anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012. The Obama Administration has focused more aid to the region on development and humanitarian purposes. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012.

Humanitarian assistance focuses on immediate relief for emergencies, including food aid and support for refugees and internally displaced persons. The State Department administers the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, which funds assistance for refugees and internally displaced persons. USAID manages most development and humanitarian programs, while the Economic Support Fund (ESF) supports U.S. economic, political, and security interests in the region. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) account is used to promote special U.S. economic, political, and security interests. Managed by USAID in conjunction with the State Department, ESF funds programs that aim to promote stability. Additionally, the United States funds security assistance programs in the region to address security concerns. The United States funds security assistance programs in the region through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining, and Related programs (NADR) accounts to address security concerns, including counternarcotics, civilian law enforcement, judicial institution strengthening, and counterterrorism efforts. The United States provides security assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean through various programs such as INCLE, NADR, FMF, and IMET. Aid levels to the region have decreased in recent years, leading to a shift in focus by Congress and the Administration. In recent years, U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has shifted towards development and humanitarian assistance as total aid levels have declined. The State Department manages INCLE and NADR accounts, while FMF and IMET accounts are administered by the Department of Defense.

The United States has provided Haiti with high levels of aid for many years, especially after the 2010 earthquake. U.S. assistance focuses on long-term development in energy, infrastructure, basic services, and governance. Colombia has also received significant aid through \"Plan Colombia,\" which has decreased as the security situation in the country has improved. Colombia has received aid through \"Plan Colombia\" since FY2000, with decreasing levels as security improves. U.S. assistance for Mexico focuses on combating criminal organizations, with aid levels declining as the emphasis shifts towards economic and social development efforts. In FY2012, the United States provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, with aid levels declining as the focus shifted towards rule of law programs.

The FY2013 State Department appropriations measure would reduce worldwide foreign aid funding by 11.8% and 4.7% from the Administration's request. The impact on assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean is uncertain, but the House version could lead to significant cuts. Members of Congress need to consider if the FY2013 request adequately reflects U.S. priorities. The FY2013 foreign aid appropriations request for Latin America and the Caribbean raises questions for Members of Congress to consider, such as whether it aligns with U.S. interests and objectives, if there are effective metrics in place, and the potential impact of proposed aid cuts. The effectiveness of assistance programs in Latin America and the potential impact of proposed aid cuts for FY2013 are key considerations for Congress. Resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and internationally is crucial for maximizing the impact of foreign assistance funds. The U.S. government agencies need to coordinate resources to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Currently, assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is managed by State Department, USAID, and DOD, but there is fragmentation among other agencies as well. A 2012 GAO report highlighted the lack of awareness among these agencies regarding each other's assistance programs. The 2012 GAO report identified a lack of coordination among U.S. agencies managing assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, including State, USAID, and DOD. This lack of awareness could lead to unnecessary overlap in aid programs. While some efforts are being made to improve coordination, there is currently no formal framework for sharing information across these agencies. Better coordination could ensure that assistance efforts are complementary and more effective. The lack of formal framework for sharing information among U.S. agencies providing assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean hinders coordination. Improved coordination could enhance the impact of aid programs and avoid duplication. The United States contributed $2.7 billion out of $10.7 billion in official development assistance to the region in 2010. In 2010, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in official development assistance. The United States contributed $2.7 billion (25%), other bilateral donors provided $5.1 billion (48%), and multilateral organizations gave $2.8 billion (26%). Studies show a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve the effectiveness of aid programs in the region. Some studies have found a lack of coordination among donors in Latin America and the Caribbean, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve the effectiveness of aid programs by ensuring complementary efforts and focusing on specific countries or sectors. However, challenges exist in determining leadership and division of labor among donors, as foreign assistance often has strategic objectives in addition to development goals. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean faces challenges in coordination and division of labor among donors. The United States has initiated trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries in the region like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide aid to third countries. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming to access new solutions and expertise to multiply the impact of development efforts. Some of the assistance requested for Brazil in FY2013 would strengthen the Brazilian government's development agency and support jointly funded agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs. The Administration requested assistance for Brazil in FY2013 to strengthen the government's development agency and implement agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in third countries.

Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments, questioning the use of U.S. funds for prohibited activities. Members of Congress may consider agencies with comparative advantages in providing training and technical assistance to partners facing similar challenges globally. Providing foreign assistance through foreign governments raises oversight concerns about potential misuse of U.S. funds. Congress may need to clarify roles of U.S. agencies, improve inter-agency coordination, and identify areas where the U.S. has a comparative advantage in providing assistance. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress may need to examine inter-agency coordination, comparative advantage in assistance programs, strategic importance of countries and sectors, and ensuring proper use of U.S. funds provided through partner nations.

USAID is transitioning its assistance programs in Colombia and other Latin American countries as partner nations develop the capacity to manage and fund programs independently. Despite successful transitions in Colombia and Panama, USAID is closing its mission in Panama and ending family planning programs in other Latin American countries due to partner nations' increased capacity. However, GAO reports highlight a lack of political will in the region to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. A 2003 study of U.S. democracy programs in Latin America found cases of programs struggling after U.S. support ended due to lack of resources. Similarly, a 2010 study on counternarcotics programs revealed countries unable to use U.S.-provided boats due to funding issues. Even MCC-funded projects faced sustainability challenges, as seen in a 2011 study on a compact in Honduras. The sustainability of MCC-funded projects in Latin America and the Caribbean is a concern due to issues with program maintenance and funding. A study in Honduras highlighted the limited lifespan of roads built with MCC assistance, as municipalities lack the resources for maintenance. Congress should consider the capacity of recipient countries to sustain provided equipment when allocating foreign aid. When considering foreign aid for Latin American and Caribbean countries, Congress should assess the recipient country's ability to maintain provided equipment and take on financial responsibility. Questions to consider include the country's capacity for maintenance, plans for financial and operational responsibility, necessary assistance over time, political will for reforms, and potential for complementing U.S. aid with host nation resources or public-private partnerships.
