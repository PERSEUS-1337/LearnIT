    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are trade agreements that Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. TPA clarifies how Congress exercises its constitutional authority over trade policy. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) clarifies Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy and provides the President with negotiating leverage. TPA has evolved to include tighter oversight and consultation requirements as trade negotiations have become more complex. Earlier versions of TPA were adopted with bipartisan support. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved with tighter oversight and consultation requirements as trade negotiations have become more complex. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and the balance of constitutional powers between Congress and the President. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved through decades of debate and cooperation between Congress and the executive branch, balancing constitutional powers and the need for flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the President on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained based on political and economic conditions, as well as shifting priorities. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has shown that the partnership between Congress and the President on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained based on evolving political and economic conditions. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over regulating foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate foreign trade, including the power to impose taxes and tariffs. In contrast, the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements, as well as oversee foreign affairs. Both legislative and executive branches play a role in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements, with Congress historically setting tariff rates as the main trade policy instrument. During the first 150 years of the United States, Congress controlled foreign trade by setting tariff rates. The President's role was to negotiate and implement bilateral treaties with the Senate's approval. Congressional debates often revolved around protectionist tariffs favored by northern manufacturing regions versus low tariffs advocated by southern commodity exporting regions. In the 1930s, U.S. trade policy underwent significant changes with the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which imposed high tariff rates in response to domestic producers seeking protection. The President's role in trade policy involved negotiating bilateral treaties with the Senate's approval, including commitments to most-favored-nation treatment. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 drastically changed U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates in response to domestic producers seeking protection. This led to retaliatory tariffs by major trade partners, severely restricting trade and worsening the effects of the Great Depression. Secretary of State Cordell Hull guided Congress to enact the Reciprocal Trade Act in response to the damaging effects of Smoot-Hawley. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) was enacted by Congress under the guidance of Secretary of State Cordell Hull in response to the damaging effects of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. This act authorized the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements to reduce tariffs within pre-approved levels, allowing for tariff adjustments without additional legislation. The RTAA authorized the President to implement tariffs on an MFN basis without additional legislation. It delegated expanded trade agreements authority to reduce tariffs within congressionally predefined ranges, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, the last general tariff legislation, now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the final general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress retained trade authority and ensured oversight by limiting the time period for trade agreements authority, subjecting it to periodic review and renewal. The trade agreements authority was legislatively insured against executive branch overreach by subjecting it to periodic review and renewal. General tariff levels declined with the establishment of GATT in 1947, shifting trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. Trade negotiations expanded beyond tariffs under the Trade Act. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established in 1947 shifted trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and required congressional review of agreements. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and required congressional review of agreements, including the GATT Kennedy Round which focused on tariff reduction and nontariff barriers. During the Kennedy Round, GATT member countries reached agreements on nontariff barriers, specifically customs valuation and antidumping practices. Many in Congress believed that adhering to these agreements would require changes in U.S. law beyond tariff modifications, leading to concerns about presidential authority. The Kennedy Round resulted in agreements on nontariff barriers, including antidumping practices. Congress believed these agreements would require changes in U.S. law beyond tariffs, leading to concerns about presidential authority. Congress passed a resolution in 1966 against negotiating \"nontariff commitments,\" setting up the debate that eventually led to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Kennedy Round agreements on nontariff barriers led to concerns about presidential authority, prompting Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 tariff modification authority expired in 1967, but Congress did not renew it for seven years as it debated legislative options. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 tariff modification authority expired in 1967, prompting Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974. This act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements reducing tariffs. Implementing legislation was required for agreements involving changes beyond tariffs, to reduce special interest pressures in trade policymaking. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements reducing tariffs. However, some argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreements authority to the President, as it could increase special interest pressures in trade policymaking. Members also recognized the potential issue of U.S. trading partners being reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. The Senate Finance Committee report accompanying the Trade Act of 1974 emphasized the need for agreements negotiated by the Executive to be given an up-or-down vote by Congress. The Senate Finance Committee report emphasized the need for trade agreements negotiated by the Executive to be given an up-or-down vote by Congress to provide assurances to trading partners. Congress agreed to suspend ordinary legislative procedures and expedite the consideration of trade agreements. Trading partners want assurances from Congress before negotiating. Congress agreed to expedite trade agreements by suspending normal procedures. Committees have limited time to consider bills, with no amendments allowed. The executive branch must consult with committees and notify Congress before signing agreements. The act also allows for the accreditation of 10 Members of Congress. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" where Congress agreed to expedite trade agreements with limited debate and no amendments. The executive branch had to consult with relevant committees and notify Congress before signing agreements. Additionally, 10 Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. This authority led to the successful conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" which led to the successful conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT in 1979. The resulting Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under the expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under the expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures established in the Trade Act of 1974. The expedited legislative procedures, ensconced in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, have remained unchanged since 1974 and are not subject to sunset provisions. Congress has revised these provisions over the years, and the ability to use them is subject to time limits. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for trade negotiations and tariff modifications until January 2, 1988, under the Trade Act of 1974. Congress has revised these procedures over the years, with no changes made to the original expedited legislative procedures established in 1974. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for trade negotiations and tariff modifications until January 2, 1988, under the Trade Act of 1974, adding trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements. Congress considered U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for trade negotiations and tariff modifications until January 2, 1988, under the Trade Act of 1974, adding trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements. Congress considered U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs that reduced tariffs and addressed nontariff barriers. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required the President to notify Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) of 1988 extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and required congressional approval for agreements leading to significant tariff modifications. It also allowed for expedited procedures unless either the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees disapproved within 60 days of notification. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) of 1988 extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Legislation for agreements entered into after June 1, 1991, but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension of such authority and it was not disapproved by Congress. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) of 1988 extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the USTR failed to consult adequately. This led to the passage of implementing legislation for NAFTA in 1993. Congress expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993 under the OTCA provisions. H.R. 1876 extended authority for Uruguay Round negotiations until April 16, 1994, with strong congressional support. In 1993, H.R. 1876 extended trade negotiation authority for the Uruguay Round until April 16, 1994, with strong congressional support. The authority was not renewed until the Trade Act of 2002, marking the longest hiatus since fast track was first approved in 1974. In 1997, legislation to renew fast track trade authority was reported by Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, but it was pulled before a floor vote due to lack of support. In September 1998, the House voted on fast track authority legislation, which failed to pass (180-243). Congress did not enact new trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration, possibly due to various reasons. The House voted on fast track authority legislation, but it failed to pass (180-243). Reasons for the failure include disagreements between Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. Additionally, the WTO did not launch new negotiations at the 1999 Ministerial meeting in Seattle. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested renewal of fast track authority, renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" to counter negative connotations. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act contained the renewed authority. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, also known as TPA, renewed fast track authority under the Trade Act of 2002. TPA included new provisions for labor and environmental objectives but did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, or TPA, included new provisions for labor and environmental objectives but did not mandate enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. It also established the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) for additional congressional consultation. The House version of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (H.R. 3005) passed by a narrow margin, mostly along party lines. It was later combined with other trade-related legislation in the Senate and ultimately approved as the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009) with bipartisan support. The Trade Act of 2002, H.R. 3009, was passed with bipartisan support, including the approval of implementing legislation for Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 (BCTPA) was introduced by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan, modeled after the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2014. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 (BCTPA) was introduced by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. It is modeled after the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2014 and involves countries like Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The legislation was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 (BCTPA) was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. TPA-2015, passed on May 22, contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 (BCTPA) updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It includes provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021, unless an extension disapproval resolution is passed by July 1, 2018. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 (BCTPA) updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021, unless an extension disapproval resolution is passed by July 1, 2018. TPA-2015 may be used to consider agreements from ongoing negotiations like TPP, T-TIP, TISA, and EGA. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to support trade negotiations by defining policy priorities and achieving four major goals. This includes negotiations such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA), and agreements resulting from the Doha Round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to support trade negotiations by defining policy priorities and achieving four major goals related to trade agreements, including those resulting from the Doha Round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations. Congress seeks to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's constitutional authority over trade. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define policy priorities and achieve four major goals related to trade agreements, including defining terms and conditions for agreements and reaffirming Congress's authority over trade. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to achieve four major goals related to trade agreements, including defining terms and conditions for agreements and reaffirming Congress's authority over trade. When trade negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers (NTBs), Congress established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" to tighten control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation. Congress tightened its control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation by establishing \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" in response to agreements requiring changes to domestic law. The Trade Act of 1974 outlined expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Under Section 2103 of the Trade Act of 2002, Congress makes these expedited procedures available only for qualifying bills. Congress established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" in response to agreements requiring changes to domestic law. The Trade Act of 1974 outlined expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Under Section 2103 of the Trade Act of 2002, Congress makes these expedited procedures available only for qualifying bills, referred to as trade implementing bills. The bill qualifies if the trade agreement meets TPA's negotiating objectives and the President satisfies notification and consultation requirements. The implementing bill must approve the agreement and the statement of administrative action. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track trade negotiating authority, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress. The implementing bill must contain provisions approving the agreement and necessary changes to domestic laws. Congress has the right to change the rules at any time regarding expedited procedures. The Trade Act of 1974 established Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for fast track trade negotiating authority. Congress has the power to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements, allowing the President to enter agreements into force by proclamation after ensuring compliance. The Trade Act of 2002 grants the President authority to enter trade agreements into force by proclamation, after certain conditions are met. This includes notifying Congress 90 days before signing the agreement and allowing for congressional review within 60 days of signing. The Trade Act of 2002 allows the President to enter trade agreements into force by proclamation, after notifying Congress and allowing for congressional review within 60 days of signing. The Trade Act of 2002 allows the President to enter trade agreements into force by proclamation after notifying Congress and allowing for congressional review within 60 days of signing. The agreement requires the President to transmit the final legal text, a draft implementing bill, a statement of administrative action, and supporting statements to Congress. If Congress is satisfied with the requirements, the implementing bill is enacted into law through expedited legislative procedures. The Trade Act of 2002 allows the President to enter trade agreements into force by proclamation after notifying Congress and allowing for congressional review within 60 days of signing. If Congress is satisfied with the requirements, the implementing bill is enacted into law through expedited legislative procedures, which include mandatory introduction in both houses of Congress and immediate referral. The Trade Act of 2002 allows the President to enter trade agreements into force by proclamation after notifying Congress and allowing for congressional review within 60 days of signing. The major rules for expedited legislative procedures include mandatory introduction in both houses of Congress, automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. This allows the President to pursue these objectives in trade negotiations with some discretion. Trade negotiating objectives defined by Congress in Trade Promotion Authority legislation are crucial for the United States and global economy. These objectives guide the President in trade negotiations and are central to the congressional debate on TPA. Congress categorizes trade negotiating objectives into overall and principal objectives. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for TPA legislation. Congress categorizes objectives into overall and principal categories, setting broad and specific goals for trade agreements. Key goals include enhancing economies, reducing trade barriers, and protecting investments and intellectual property. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for TPA legislation, setting specific goals for trade agreements such as reducing barriers to trade, protecting investments, encouraging transparency, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. Consultation with Congress is also an important obligation. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for TPA legislation, setting specific goals for trade agreements such as reducing barriers to trade, protecting investments, encouraging transparency, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. The language defining these objectives has been contested in the past, reflecting their importance as a template for future trade agreements. The controversy surrounding TPA negotiating objectives highlights their significance as a template for future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in these objectives, have sparked contentious debates, particularly regarding the lack of minimal enforceable standards in TPA. This issue has carried over to subsequent trade agreements, leading to further debate in Congress. The decision not to include minimal enforceable standards in TPA led to contentious debates over FTAs, such as the CAFTA-DR in 2005. The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, making the vote on renewing TPA authority critical for Congress. The renewal of TPA/fast track authority is a critical trade vote in Congress. The President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers. Notification and consultation requirements have been revised in each renewal of authority. The President must conduct notifications and consultations with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG), before commencing trade negotiations. The timing of these notifications is detailed in the timeline presented in Appendix B. The President must notify Congress and consult with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups before entering into trade negotiations. Specific notifications and consultations are also required before and after agreements are signed. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress at least 90 days prior to signing the agreement, consulting with relevant committees, and notifying revenue committees of any potential changes to trade remedy laws at least 180 days prior to the agreement. Private sector advisory committee reports must also be submitted to Congress and the President. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress at least 90 days prior to signing the agreement, consulting with relevant committees, and notifying revenue committees of any potential changes to trade remedy laws at least 180 days prior to the agreement. Private sector advisory committee reports must also be submitted to Congress, the President, and the USTR within 30 days after notifying Congress of the intention to enter into an agreement. Additionally, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) must be provided with trade agreement details at least 90 days before entering into an agreement, and a report on the impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy must be presented to Congress no later than 105 days after the agreement is signed. The congressional consultation process is a crucial part of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), requiring the President to notify Congress 90 days before signing a trade agreement, present a report on the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy within 105 days, and release the agreement text 60 days prior to signing. This process allows Congress to influence trade negotiations and ensure trade policy remains within its purview. The consultation process under Trade Promotion Authority allows Congress to influence trade negotiations and ensure trade policy remains within its purview. The Government Accountability Office found that while the USTR conducted extensive consultations with Congress on FTAs from 2002 to 2007, the effectiveness of the process has been questioned. The USTR conducted extensive consultations with Congress on FTAs from 2002 to 2007. However, congressional staff felt that the consultation process did not allow sufficient time for input, often felt like briefings rather than consultations, and did not always include last-minute changes to draft FTA texts. Staff expressed concerns that the process may need to be amended. The consultation process for FTAs with Congress did not always include last-minute changes to draft texts, leading to concerns about the need for greater and earlier congressional input. Similar issues have been raised regarding TPP and other trade negotiations. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade bills due to congressional procedures. Congress adopted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures to prevent delays in trade bills due to congressional procedures, protecting fragile consensus between trade partners. TPA limits congressional amendments that could change trade agreements while preserving Congress's constitutional authority over trade matters. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures were designed to protect consensus from congressional amendments that could alter trade agreements. Congress retains its constitutional authority over trade matters and includes provisions in TPA to limit expedited procedures. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for a limited time to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 extends these procedures for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures provide expedited procedures for trade agreements to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 extends these procedures for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021, with no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the authority expires. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation does not specify a deadline for submitting implementing legislation for FTAs entered into before the authority expires. For example, FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea were signed in previous Congresses, but implementing bills were not passed until later. The President must request an extension of TPA authority after a certain period, which is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows the President to request an extension of authority after a certain period. The extension is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution, which must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch that expedited legislative procedures can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied with trade agreement negotiations conducted by the President. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows the President to request an extension of authority, which can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied with trade agreement negotiations. The President must fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve the congressional role in trade agreements. Congress can decide that the implementing bill is not eligible under TPA rules and adopt a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows Congress to deny the President's request for an extension of authority if it is dissatisfied with trade agreement negotiations. Congress can decide that the implementing bill is not eligible under TPA rules and adopt a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution, triggered by a Committee on Congressional Relations (CCR) procedure in TPA-2015. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to withdraw or override expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote by either chamber. Congressional committees can trigger a Committee on Congressional Relations (CCR) procedure if implementing legislation is reported unfavorably. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to withdraw or override expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote by either chamber. This suggests that the success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) relies on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, as well as between political parties. The previous TPA lacked this cooperation, leading to strain in the trade legislative process. Since at least 1993, bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been lacking, leading to strain in the trade legislative process. Congress, with support from the executive branch, follows specific procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. Since 1993, bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been lacking, leading to strain in the trade legislative process. Congress, with support from the executive branch, follows specific procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills, including reviewing the agreement before introducing the implementing bill. Prior to introducing the implementing bill, Congress reviews the trade agreement in hearings before relevant committees. This process includes informal markup sessions and a mock conference to gauge congressional response. The White House sent over a draft of the trade agreement for informal markup by congressional committees. This allows members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the implementing legislation. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in the markups by the revenue committees. The White House sent a draft of the trade agreement for informal markup by congressional committees to signal changes they want in the implementing legislation. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in markups by revenue committees, and the Administration can choose to accept suggested changes from Congress. The Administration can exercise discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress in the final implementing bill. For example, the Bush Administration declined to include a Senate Finance Committee amendment in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA's requirement for only necessary or appropriate legislation. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement. The Oman FTA implementing bill passed, but a new bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement arose due to dissatisfaction with both the Oman FTA and the TPA process. Congress has at times encouraged additions or clarifications to trade agreements, resulting in side agreements involving additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side agreements or side letters are additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed. Side agreements, like the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA, may not always be subject to fast track procedures. Side letters, on the other hand, clarify specific issues and are common in bilateral FTAs to address congressional concerns. They are typically exchanged between top trade negotiating representatives. Side letters in bilateral FTAs are used to address congressional concerns and are exchanged between top trade negotiating representatives. They accompany the agreement but do not change its text, requiring official signatures from all negotiating parties to be considered in force. Enforcement of side agreements and letters remains untested. Members of Congress sometimes rely on informal commitments from the executive branch to address specific issues raised during mock markups. The enforceability of side letters in bilateral FTAs remains untested, with Members of Congress relying on informal commitments from the executive branch to address specific issues. For example, the Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and it has been common practice for the President to request renewed TPA from Congress. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for TPA, which expired on July 1, 2007. President Obama faced criticism for delaying a request for TPA renewal, but eventually requested it in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may also consider revamping parts of the 2002 law related to TPA. President Obama requested Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal in 2013 and 2015. Congress may revamp parts of the 2002 law related to TPA. Some argue TPA may not be necessary if consensus is reached on Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal was requested by President Obama in 2013 and 2015. While some argue TPA may not be needed if consensus is reached on Free Trade Agreements (FTA), TPA serves to build consensus on trade policy, signal congressional support for FTAs, and ensure Congress's role in defining negotiating objectives and consultation. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal serves to build consensus on trade policy, signal congressional support for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and ensure Congress's role in defining negotiating objectives and consultation. The timing of TPA renewal is a key question, with some suggesting waiting until negotiations for a specific FTA are near completion, while others argue for early action in the negotiation process. The scope and content of U.S. trade negotiating objectives have expanded as trade structures have changed and issues have become more complex, leading to debates on the timing of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal. Some suggest waiting for specific FTA negotiations to be near completion, while others argue for early action in the negotiation process. Congress must consider these aspects when deciding on TPA renewal. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has evolved with changing trade structures and complex issues, leading to debates on the timing of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal. Several negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 address new topics not seen in previous renewals, such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on small businesses. The current trade negotiations, such as the TPP, focus on new issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on small businesses. These evolving objectives in trade agreements are a key point of contention for TPA renewal. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements is a controversial area for TPA renewal. Democrats were dissatisfied with the outcome in the Trade Act of 2002, leading to a largely partisan vote. Approval of FTAs was withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached in the \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007, which included changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 brought significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have been seen as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. Congress may consider incorporating these commitments into formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA. Some Republicans and Democrats accept the May 10th Understanding as a baseline for future trade agreements, but not all. Congress may consider including these commitments in formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA. There are differing opinions on whether further improvements can be made to these provisions. TPA-2015 includes key provisions of the May 10th Understanding on labor and environmental provisions. Some Members of Congress have concerns about the May 10th Understanding not being seen as a new trade policy agreement. TPA-2015 incorporates key elements of the Understanding on labor and environmental issues, but it is unclear how it addresses IPR provisions. Congress is dissatisfied with the executive branch's handling of trade negotiation consultations under TPA, especially with the TPP negotiations. Key issues include ensuring Congress has a say in the process. The issue of trade negotiation consultation under TPA has gained new life with the TPP negotiations. Key concerns include ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the process and have access to draft texts. Some argue that Congress has less access to draft text than business and NGOs. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures. Members of Congress, especially those on trade committees, are pushing for more access to draft texts and earlier involvement in trade agreement negotiations. There is bipartisan interest in ensuring that the U.S. enforces commitments made by its trade partners in agreements. Negotiations are aimed at influencing the agreement text and participating in drafting the implementing bill. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade commitments. Legislative efforts and the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center address trade enforcement. Congress may need to consider trade agreement enforcement language in TPA. Technical issues from the 112th Congress's use of TPA procedures may need reevaluation. The recent use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that Congress may need to reevaluate, particularly regarding the strict interpretation of using TPA only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills. TPA-2015 requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate.\" Some Members want to define this language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility in applying the standard.

The power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, with TPA being a key element in this process. The current TPA authorization legislation is under consideration for renewal to address these issues. Congress is considering options for renewing TPA authorization legislation, including renewing and revising TPA authority or extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP. The TPA-2015 legislation grants the President new authority without restricting it to specific agreement negotiations. Congress could extend TPA for specific agreements like the TPP or grant the President permanent TPA authority. Representative Levin proposed a modified grant of TPA covering only TPP negotiations. Congress could grant the President permanent fast track/TPA authority in a two-tier procedure, with specific negotiations requiring approval from both houses of Congress. The lack of TPA renewal may delay future trade agreements, but trade policy can still progress through other means like TIFAs and unilateral preference arrangements.

Congressional Trade Agreements Authority has been requested and granted to Presidents since 1934. Before the formal TPA expedited procedures, House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation. These meetings allow Congress to express concerns before final legislation is sent for expedited procedures. The President sends a final legal draft text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress for expedited procedures. Identical bills are introduced in each house of Congress and referred to the House Ways and Means and Senate. The draft bill reflecting amendments adopted in mock markup is subject to mandatory introduction in Congress. Committees have 45 days to report the bill, or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee must act on revenue bills under TPA procedures. The implementing bill subject to TPA procedures must be acted upon by the Senate Finance Committee within a specified timeframe. Once the bill is reported or discharged, any Member can motion to consider it, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. After the implementing bill is reported or discharged, any Member can offer a non-debatable motion to consider it. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the measure cannot be amended. If floor action is not completed within 15 days, any Member can bring it to a vote. The bill passes by a simple majority, and the second House typically takes a final vote on the bill received from the first House. After the implementing bill is signed, the agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation. This typically occurs after the USTR has assured the President that the partner country(ies) has made the legislative changes. After the implementing bill is signed, the trade agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation, following assurance from the USTR that partner countries have met all obligations."
