The proposed Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes an autoencoder for initial cluster estimates and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives, allowing customization of the temporal clustering layer with various similarity metrics. Insights into the learned features for clustering are gained through analysis. The Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm allows customization of the temporal clustering layer with different similarity metrics. A visualization method generates heat maps to show learned features in timeseries data from various domains. The algorithm consistently outperforms traditional methods due to integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criteria. Our algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), has shown superior performance in various domains by integrating temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criteria. While deep learning is dominant in supervised learning, unsupervised learning techniques are crucial for inferring from unlabeled data. However, progress in learning complex structures from unlabeled data has been limited compared to labeled datasets. The progress in learning complex structures from unlabeled data has been limited, with a focus on labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques like clustering organize similar objects into clusters, but their application to time series data remains a challenge. The challenge lies in extending clustering techniques to time series data, which varies in properties, features, scales, and dimensionality across different domains. This gap in technology hinders accurate unsupervised learning of time series data used in various fields like financial trading, medical monitoring, and event detection. The novel algorithm deep temporal clustering (DTC) addresses challenges in unsupervised time series clustering by transforming data into a low dimensional latent space. Time series data from different domains have variations in properties, features, scales, and dimensionality, making standard clustering techniques limited in real-world applications. The novel algorithm deep temporal clustering (DTC) addresses challenges in unsupervised time series clustering by transforming data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer. The DTC algorithm disentangles data manifolds to uncover informative features on all time scales. The proposed DTC algorithm utilizes a three-level approach to disentangle data manifolds in time series data. The first level, a CNN, learns short-time-scale waveforms, while the second level, a BI-LSTM, learns temporal connections across all time scales. The DTC algorithm consists of three levels: a CNN to learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to learn temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to find spatio-temporal dimensions in the data. This approach untangles data manifolds without discarding time course information, leading to high performance on various datasets. The DTC algorithm utilizes a CNN and BI-LSTM to learn waveforms and temporal connections, respectively, and non-parametric clustering to find spatio-temporal dimensions in data. It achieves high performance on datasets without parameter adjustment and includes a feature to visualize cluster-assignment activations over time. This provides explanations for class assignment based on informative data features. The study introduces a novel deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on achieving meaningful clustering through effective latent representation and a integrated similarity metric. This is the first work to apply deep learning in temporal clustering, providing explanations for class assignment based on informative data features.

The end-to-end optimization of the network for reconstruction loss and clustering loss offers superior performance compared to optimizing these objectives separately. DTC outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on various real-world time series datasets. The study introduces a novel deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on achieving meaningful clustering through effective latent representation and an integrated similarity metric. DTC outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on various real-world time series datasets by optimizing reconstruction loss and clustering loss together. Existing research in temporal clustering methods has focused on dimensionality reduction and similarity metric selection. One class of solutions uses application-dependent dimensionality reduction to filter out noise, such as adaptive piecewise constant approximation and nonnegative matrix factorization. However, these approaches may lose long-range temporal correlations and relevant features. Another class of solutions focuses on creating a suitable similarity measure between time series. The limitations of current solutions include the hand-crafted and application-specific nature of transformations, requiring extensive domain knowledge. Another approach involves creating a suitable similarity measure between time series, incorporating features like complexity, correlation, and time warping. Studies have shown that the choice of similarity measure significantly impacts results in clustering algorithms. The choice of similarity measure significantly impacts clustering results in time series data. While a good similarity measure is important, proper dimensionality reduction is also crucial for optimal clustering results. Transforming time series data into a low dimensional latent space is effective for temporal clustering, but there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an effective latent space. Recent research has shown that casting time series data into a low dimensional latent space is effective for temporal clustering. However, there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an effective latent space. Clustering methods for static data have achieved superior performance by jointly optimizing a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a k-means objective for clustering, but these approaches are not well suited for time series data. The proposed DTC method aims to perform unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences using a convolutional autoencoder and a BI-LSTM. This approach is designed for time series data clustering, unlike previous methods that were tailored for static data. The proposed DTC method clusters unlabeled sequences into k \u2264 n clusters based on latent high-level features of x using a convolutional autoencoder and a BI-LSTM. The latent representation is fed to a temporal clustering layer to generate cluster assignments, with a focus on effective latent representation achieved through a temporal autoencoder. The network architecture includes a temporal autoencoder (TAE) for generating cluster assignments. It uses a 1D convolution layer to extract short-term features and Leaky ReLUs for dimensionality reduction. This compact representation is crucial for avoiding poor performance with very long sequences. The network architecture includes a temporal autoencoder (TAE) with 1D CNN and BI-LSTM layers for dimensionality reduction and learning temporal changes in time series data. The BI-LSTM layer collapses input sequences into a smaller latent space, and the clustering layer assigns sequences to clusters based on the BI-LSTM latent representation. The network architecture involves a temporal autoencoder with 1D CNN and BI-LSTM layers for dimensionality reduction and learning temporal changes in time series data. The BI-LSTM layer collapses input sequences into a smaller latent space, and the clustering layer assigns sequences to clusters based on the BI-LSTM latent representation. Learning in both 1D CNN and BI-LSTM is driven by minimizing two cost functions, including mean square error for input sequence reconstruction. Reconstruction involves upsampling and deconvolutional layers to obtain autoencoder output. The BI-LSTM latent representation is used for reconstruction in the network architecture, ensuring sequences are well represented. A clustering metric in level 3 optimizes high-level features to separate sequences into distinct clusters based on spatio-temporal behavior. This optimization modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN layers. The subspace spanned by cluster centroids separates sequences into distinct clusters with spatio-temporal behavior. Optimization of clustering metric modifies weights in BI-LSTM and CNN, resulting in high-level features that disentangle spatio-temporal manifolds of dynamics. End-to-end network optimization efficiently extracts features to categorize input sequences into clusters, unraveling high-dimensional input dynamics. The network efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features to separate input sequences into categories, unlike traditional approaches that only optimize reconstruction or clustering. This leads to improved unsupervised categorization. The traditional approaches optimize separation in latent feature space, which may not be ideal for improving data separability. End-to-end optimization shows significant improvement in unsupervised categorization compared to disjointly optimized dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. Directly applying clustering algorithms to spatio-temporal data without initial dimensionality reduction often leads to overfitting and poor performance. This approach emphasizes effective end-to-end optimization while utilizing advanced clustering techniques. The approach avoids overfitting by utilizing temporal continuity in spatio-temporal data for effective feature extraction and encoding in the BI-LSTM latent representation. The temporal clustering layer initializes centroids using latent signals from a TAE, followed by hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. The temporal clustering layer in BI-LSTM initializes centroids using latent signals from a TAE and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain initial estimates. The layer is then trained using an unsupervised algorithm that alternates between computing assignment probabilities and updating centroids. The temporal clustering layer in BI-LSTM initializes centroids using latent signals from a TAE and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain initial estimates. It then trains using an unsupervised algorithm that alternates between computing assignment probabilities and updating centroids based on distances from each centroid. The temporal clustering layer in BI-LSTM updates centroids using a loss function to maximize high confidence assignments. Distances from centroids are computed using a similarity metric and normalized into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. Probability of input belonging to a cluster is calculated based on latent signals obtained from a temporal autoencoder. The assignment of latent signals to clusters is determined by the probability of input belonging to a cluster, calculated using a similarity metric and normalized with a Student's t distribution kernel. The latent signals are obtained from a temporal autoencoder, and distances from centroids are computed to update centroids in the temporal clustering layer of BI-LSTM. The study experiments with various similarity metrics, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2, which computes similarity based on the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation of the two series. CID proposed by BID2 calculates similarity using euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation of two series x, y. The distance is determined by the complexity factor CF(x, y) which is the minimum of complexity estimates CE(x) and CE(y). If complexity differs, distance increases. If complexity is the same, distance is euclidean. Complexity of each sequence is defined as N, the length of the sequence 2. The complexity differences between series increase the distance. If sequences have the same complexity, the distance is the euclidean distance. Correlation based Similarity computes similarities using pearsons correlation. Auto Correlation based Similarity computes similarity between latent representations. In this study, the COR is computed using pearson's correlation. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) calculates similarity between latent representation and centroids using ACF coefficients and weighted euclidean distance. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss between q and a target distribution for training the temporal clustering layer. The choice of target distribution is crucial. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss between q and a target distribution for training the temporal clustering layer, using a crucial choice of target distribution. The KL divergence loss is computed using a formula where n and k are the number of samples in the dataset and number of clusters respectively. Using the target distribution, the KL divergence loss is computed with n and k as the number of samples and clusters. Batch-wise joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder involves minimizing KL divergence and mean squared error. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial as they reflect the data's latent representation. Pretraining autoencoder parameters ensures initial centroids represent the data accurately.
