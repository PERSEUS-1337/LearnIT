    "content": "The proposed generative model architecture aims to learn image representations that isolate a single attribute from the rest of the image. This attribute can be altered without changing the object's identity, such as in the example of wearing glasses on a human face. The goal is to manipulate image attributes without affecting the object's identity. The study focuses on learning a representation of an image that separates object identity from attributes, allowing for image attribute manipulation. The model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. The model demonstrates image attribute manipulation by showing the same face with and without a chosen attribute. It achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks using latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs. These models learn a mapping from a latent encoding space to a data space, where neighboring points in latent space correspond to similar images in data space. Latent space learned by generative models like GANs and VAEs is organized in a near-linear fashion, with certain directions corresponding to changes in attributes like facial expressions. This can be useful for image synthesis, editing, and avatar creation. Latent space in generative models can be manipulated to make semantically meaningful changes to images, such as editing existing images or synthesizing avatars. Research has focused on class conditional image synthesis, where images of specific object categories are generated, including fine-grain subcategories like different dog breeds. In contrast to class conditional image synthesis focusing on specific object categories, our work aims to manipulate image attributes by synthesizing images and changing one element or attribute. Our work focuses on manipulating image attributes by synthesizing images and changing one element or attribute, such as editing a person's smile in a face synthesis. This approach differs from fine-grain synthesis as we aim to synthesize two similar faces with only one chosen attribute changed. This makes image attribute manipulation more challenging than fine-grain synthesis. The paper proposes a new model for manipulating facial attributes by learning a factored representation that separates attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset to control several facial attributes. The paper introduces a new model that learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. It includes a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to factorize binary facial attribute information from a continuous identity representation. The model achieves competitive classification scores with state-of-the-art methods. The paper introduces a new model that separates attribute information from facial representation.

The model achieves competitive classification scores with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. Additionally, the paper discusses the distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing. The paper introduces a new model that separates attribute information from facial representation, achieving competitive classification scores and successfully editing the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. It discusses the distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing, presenting code to reproduce experiments with Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Variational autoencoders BID14 BID28 and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are models that synthesize novel data samples from latent encodings. VAEs consist of an encoder and decoder, often implemented as neural networks with learnable parameters. The VAE is trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x), where p(x) is the data-generating distribution. The encoder predicts \u00b5\u03c6(x) and \u03c3\u03c6(x) for a given input x, and a latent sample \u1e91 is drawn from q\u03c6(z|x). The ELBO is calculated using a chosen prior distribution, such as a multivariate Gaussian. The encoder predicts \u00b5\u03c6(x) and \u03c3\u03c6(x) for input x, and a latent sample \u1e91 is drawn from q\u03c6(z|x). New data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from the prior z \u223c p(z) and then generating data samples from p\u03b8(x|z). VAEs offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing in the latent space. However, VAE samples are often blurred. An alternative model for sharper images is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of a generator and a discriminator. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a sharper image synthesis alternative to VAEs. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator trained using convolutional neural networks in a mini-max game to produce realistic images. The discriminator in a GAN is trained to classify samples as 'fake' or 'real', while the generator aims to confuse the discriminator by synthesizing samples that are indistinguishable from real ones. The objective function involves the distribution of synthesized samples and a chosen prior distribution like a multivariate Gaussian. The vanilla GAN model lacks a straightforward method to map data samples to latent space. The vanilla GAN model lacks a simple way to map data samples to latent space. While some GAN variants involve learning an encoder model, only one approach allows faithful reconstruction of data samples through adversarial training on high dimensional distributions. Training adversarial networks on high dimensional data samples remains challenging despite proposed improvements. Instead of adding a decoder to a GAN, an alternative approach is considered. Adversarial training on high dimensional distributions remains challenging despite proposed improvements. Instead of adding a decoder to a GAN, an alternative approach combines a VAE with a GAN to ensure higher quality data samples outputted from the decoder. Various suggestions exist on how to combine VAEs and GANs with different structures and loss functions. A discriminator can be added after the decoder in a VAE-GAN combination to improve data sample quality. Different approaches have been proposed to merge VAEs and GANs with varying structures and loss functions, but none are specifically designed for attribute editing. Image samples generated from a VAE or GAN depend on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution, p(z). Well-trained models will produce samples resembling the training data, which may consist of images from multiple categories. Conditional VAEs and GANs provide a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples by allowing category-conditional image synthesis through the use of one-hot label vectors appended to the encoder and decoder inputs. Autoencoders offer a solution for category-conditional image synthesis by incorporating one-hot label vectors into the encoder and decoder inputs. An alternative approach presented involves the encoder outputting both a latent vector and an attribute vector, updating the encoder to minimize a classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector. A more interesting approach for conditional autoencoders is presented by BID22, where the encoder outputs a latent vector and an attribute vector. The encoder is updated to minimize a classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector. Incorporating attribute information in this way has drawbacks when the model's purpose is to edit specific attributes rather than synthesize samples from a particular category. In a naive implementation of conditional VAEs, changing the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. This indicates that information about the attribute to be edited is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector. Similar issues have been discussed in the GAN literature. Modifying the attribute vector does not always result in changes to the intended attribute, suggesting that the latent vector contains most of the information needed for reconstruction. This separation of information between the attribute vector and latent vector is crucial for conditional VAEs. The proposed process 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate information about attributes from a latent vector using mini-max optimization involving the encoder, auxiliary network, and input image. The latent vector captures identity, while a unit vector represents the presence of a desired attribute. The proposed method 'Adversarial Information Factorization' separates attribute information from a latent vector by training an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately while updating the VAE encoder to output values that deceive the auxiliary network. The proposed method involves training an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately while updating the VAE encoder to output values that deceive the auxiliary network, aiming to separate attribute information from a latent vector. The novel approach involves training the encoder of a VAE to separate information about y from the latent encoding, \u1e91, by factorizing the label information out. This method is integrated into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality, with an auxiliary network introduced for this purpose. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for separating label information from the latent encoding. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute and latent vectors. The decoder's parameters are updated using a binary cross-entropy loss function. The encoder parameters are updated with gradients from a loss function involving binary cross-entropy. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder for attribute manipulation.

An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder for attribute manipulation. The model includes a VAE with information factorization, split into E z,\u03c6 and E y,\u03c6 for latent encoding and label extraction. A GAN architecture can be incorporated using a discriminator. The VAE with information factorization includes E z,\u03c6 and E y,\u03c6 for latent encoding and label extraction. A GAN architecture can be added with a discriminator. The cVAE-GAN BID3 Architecture is similar but lacks an auxiliary network for information factorization and predicts a label only for the reconstructed image. The cVAE-GAN BID3 Architecture lacks an auxiliary network for information factorization and predicts a label only for the reconstructed image. To factor label information out of the latent space, an additional auxiliary network, A \u03c8, is introduced and trained to predict the label from the latent space. The encoder is updated to prevent the auxiliary network from making correct classifications, encouraging the encoder not to encode attribute information in the latent space. The encoder is updated to prevent the auxiliary network from making correct classifications, encouraging attribute information not to be encoded in the latent space. Training involves maximizing confusion of the auxiliary network A \u03c8, which cannot predict the true label y from the latent output\u1e91=E z,\u03c6(x). The encoder loss is determined by this process, resulting in an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model. Training details are outlined in Algorithm 1 for editing images to reflect desired attributes. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model is trained using Algorithm 1 to edit images by manipulating desired attributes. This involves encoding the image to obtain a representation, appending it to the attribute label, and passing it through the decoder to synthesize samples in different modes of the attribute. Attribute manipulation is achieved through a 'switch flipping' operation in the representation space, with both quantitative and qualitative results presented to evaluate the model.

The cVAE-GAN BID3 may struggle to edit desired attributes when trained for low reconstruction error. The cVAE-GAN BID3 model may fail to edit desired attributes, particularly when trained for low reconstruction error. It is challenging to learn a representation that preserves identity and allows factorization.

Similar approaches by Schmidhuber and BID16 also factorize latent space for attribute label information. Our work incorporates adversarial information factorization to implicitly minimize mutual information between latent representations and labels, similar to BID4's approach. Unlike BID16, our model predicts attribute information in the encoder for use as a classifier. Our work utilizes adversarial information factorization to implicitly minimize mutual information between latent representations and labels, inspired by BID4. This approach differs from BID16 as our model predicts attribute information in the encoder for classification purposes. Our objective is to manipulate specific attributes in images, such as making \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\", requiring a different type of factorization in the latent representation compared to cVAE-GAN. Our model aims to synthesize specific attributes in images, such as \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\", which requires a unique factorization in the latent representation. Changing categories is simpler as it results in noticeable image changes, while changing attributes necessitates targeted modifications with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Additionally, our model learns a classifier for input images simultaneously. Our model focuses on synthesizing specific attributes in images with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Unlike previous works, we incorporate an identity classification loss and use a VAE-GAN architecture for image editing. Our work focuses on attribute editing in images using a VAE-GAN architecture, highlighting the importance of separating label information in the latent encoding for successful editing. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images using a VAE-GAN architecture. It is crucial to separate label information in the latent encoding for successful editing. The approach discussed is specific to latent space generative models, where small changes in latent space lead to meaningful changes in image space. This approach differs from \"image-to-image\" models that aim to learn a single latent representation for images in different domains. Progress has been made in image-to-image domain adaptation, translating images from one domain to another. In this paper, attribute editing in images is discussed using a VAE-GAN architecture. By performing factorization in the latent space, a single generative model can edit attributes by changing a single unit of the encoding. This approach differs from image-to-image models that require more resources and aim to learn a single latent representation for images in different domains. By factorizing in the latent space, a single generative model can edit attributes by changing a single unit of the encoding. The approach differs from other models that learn disentangled representations from unlabelled data. The \u03b2-VAE objective minimizes mutual information to learn a disentangled representation. Our approach involves a supervised factorization of the latent space to minimize mutual information and allow for modification of image attributes. Demonstrated on human face images, this method can be applied to other objects as well. Our approach involves a novel model called Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, which allows for the modification of image attributes without affecting the object's identity.
