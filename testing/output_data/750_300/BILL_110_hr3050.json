    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT\" between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement aims to prevent and control forest fires in the region by maintaining adequate firefighting services and providing reciprocal aid among member states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. The compact becomes effective once ratified by two or more member states. ARTICLE III states that the state forester or equivalent officer responsible for forest fire control can act as the compact administrator for their state, coordinating with officials from other member states to prevent and control forest fires. The compact administrators can organize to integrate services and implement the purposes of the compact. Each member state can develop and implement a forest fire plan. \"ARTICLE IV states that if a state forest fire control agency requests aid from another member state, the requested agency can provide assistance while ensuring protection at home. ARTICLE V is not provided.\" If a member state provides aid to another state under the compact, the employees will have the same powers and duties as the receiving state's employees. The providing state and its employees are not liable for any actions or equipment used during the aid. The compact states that any liability arising from providing aid must be assumed and borne by the requesting state. The member state rendering aid will be reimbursed for any losses incurred. The requesting state is responsible for any liability related to aid. The member state providing aid will be reimbursed for losses and expenses incurred. Each member state is responsible for any liability related to aid provided. Workers compensation benefits must be available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers and auxiliaries involved in forest fire fighting. The compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement under this agreement, in accordance with member state laws. \"ARTICLE VI\" \"Ratification of this compact does not authorize any member state to reduce its forest fire fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact were not in effect. The compact does not limit a state's power to prevent and control forest fires.\" The compact does not limit a state's power to prevent and control forest fires within its borders. It also does not affect any existing or future cooperative relationship between the United States Forest Service and a member state. \"Articles VII, VIII, and IX of the compact address the attendance of United States Forest Service representatives at meetings, reciprocal aid in combating forest fires between states party to the compact, and the mutual aid provisions between states in different regions.\" Article IX of the compact states that it will remain in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with the withdrawal becoming effective six months after notice is sent to all parties of the compact."
