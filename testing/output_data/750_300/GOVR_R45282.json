    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations and applications. These fees fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework to partially cover costs for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities, in addition to annual appropriations from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework to cover costs for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. PRIA 1 modified provisions from 1988 to enhance EPA's review of pesticide registrations and authorized the collection of registration service fees for new pesticide registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities, including collecting fees for new registrations and review activities. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and amended these provisions. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities, including collecting fees for new registrations and review activities. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and amended these provisions by adding new application categories, revising decision timeframes, and adjusting fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act established a fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities, including new registrations and review activities. PRIA 3 in 2012 reauthorized and amended the pesticide fee framework, setting annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on the number of registrations held. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018. FIFRA Section 4, as amended by PRIA 3, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held. EPA may collect up to $27.8 million annually from FY2013 through FY2018. Registrants failing to pay may have their pesticide registration canceled. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from maintenance fees. Section 4 of FIFRA authorizes EPA to cancel pesticide registrations for non-payment of maintenance fees. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and public health pesticides are exempt from these fees. Collected fees go into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA to use in evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing, and reevaluating registered pesticides. EPA receives mandatory appropriations for evaluating inert ingredients, processing applications, and reevaluating pesticides. Section 4 allocates funds for enhancing information systems capabilities. EPA's authority to collect registration fees will phase out after FY2018. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees will begin to phase out after FY2018 as per the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. If not extended, registration service fees collected by EPA would be reduced by 70% for FY2019 and expire at the end of FY2019.

EPA must complete actions within specified timeframes, with fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for minor pesticide uses. EPA sets registration service fee amounts for various actions under FIFRA Section 33, with fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for minor pesticide uses. Tolerance setting in the public interest and applications from federal and state entities are also exempt from fees. EPA cannot assess fees without advance appropriations for specified functions. EPA must receive advance appropriations to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33. If appropriations for specified functions are below the FY2012 level, EPA cannot assess fees. However, from FY2013 to FY2018, EPA was authorized to collect fees regardless of appropriations. For FY2013 through FY2018, EPA was authorized to collect pesticide registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. The fees collected are deposited into the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and are subject to annual appropriations for expenditure. The \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" receives fee receipts subject to annual appropriations for various purposes including application review, worker protection activities, grants, and education programs. The Pesticide Registration Fund receives service fees for worker protection activities, grants, and education programs. FIFRA mandates annual audits of the fund and requires EPA to report on its pesticide program. The Inspector General must submit audit findings and recommendations to EPA and congressional committees. FIFRA requires EPA to report annually on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, but the exact amount for the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs is not specified. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for the Office of Pesticide Programs. Collected maintenance fees ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million per fiscal year from FY2004 to FY2018, while registration service fees ranged from $10.6 million to $18.6 million per fiscal year in the same period.

The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 authorizes EPA to propose revisions to pesticide applicator standards, including application exclusion zones. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application availability by October 1, 2021. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires a report by October 1, 2021, on the use of designated representatives in pesticide application. The report will assess their impact on availability of information and worker safety, with recommendations to prevent misuse. This is part of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. The House and Senate are in the process of reconciling differences in the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were passed without roll call votes, indicating support for extending the pesticide fee framework. The current PRIA reauthorization has not been finalized due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations. Members have acknowledged a coalition of organizations that supported PRIA in the early 2000s."
