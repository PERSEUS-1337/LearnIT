DOD's spending accounted for 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that utilizing data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could lead to significant cost savings, improved resource allocation, and enhanced military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data as a critical first step in enhancing defense acquisitions. Improved data analysis is seen as crucial for reforming defense acquisitions, with the National Defense Industrial Association highlighting data as a critical first step. Congress has taken various measures to enhance DOD's efficiency, including making the department auditable and incorporating acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts. Enhanced data analysis could lead to more effective decision-making, prompting Congress to consider increasing oversight in this area. The report examines the effectiveness of DOD's data usage in decision-making, critical elements for improvement, recent efforts, and potential questions for Congress, focusing on defense acquisitions as a case study. The report focuses on DOD's use of data in decision-making, highlighting critical elements for improvement, recent efforts, and potential questions for Congress. It primarily examines defense acquisitions as a case study. Many analysts believe that data analysis is crucial for making well-informed policy decisions and managing government programs, especially with advances in information technology. Decisionmakers with access to sufficient data can measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency into government operations. \"Access to sufficient data allows decisionmakers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency into government operations. Lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and wasteful policies, as highlighted in a 2015 GAO report.\" The 2015 GAO report highlighted issues with data access and analytical tools in government acquisitions and requirements development. This led to inefficiencies, excess inventories exceeding $1 billion, and unreliable data in the Army's appropriations status report. The DOD did not properly review or track spare parts data, leading to excess inventories over $1 billion. Reports in 2011, 2013, and 2014 highlighted unreliable data affecting audit readiness, supply chain management in Afghanistan, and distribution of supplies to warfighters. The DOD's lack of proper data tracking hampered supply distribution to warfighters in Afghanistan. Despite the importance of data, decision-making processes often lack substantive data, leading to major policy decisions being made without it.

Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions in the private sector. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions in the private sector and how it applies to government settings. Congress enacted the DATA Act in 2014 to improve government operations by enabling better tracking of Federal spending. The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, aims to improve government operations by enabling better tracking of Federal spending and establishing Government-wide data standards for financial data. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain highlighted the importance of data accuracy in a recent hearing on DOD management. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described the challenges faced by the Department of Defense in obtaining accurate financial data, highlighting the importance of data accuracy in addressing management problems. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain emphasized the need to improve data quality submitted to USASpending.gov to hold Federal agencies accountable. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the challenges in obtaining accurate financial data at the Department of Defense, leading to inefficiency, wasted resources, and harm to national security. This lack of information hinders the ability to measure the results of national security policies, prioritize military needs, and assess effectively. The lack of accurate financial data at the Department of Defense hinders national security. Department leaders and Congress cannot measure policy results, prioritize military needs, or assess tradeoffs effectively. Analysts suggest improving information systems, data accuracy, and using data for decision-making. The importance of having accurate information systems for the Department of Defense is highlighted, as it is crucial for effective decision-making. The lack of proper databases can lead to manual, paper-based processes for managing multibillion-dollar programs. Effective information systems are crucial for managing weapon system portfolios, as manual processes can be labor-intensive and error-prone. Leaders may struggle to utilize program information fully due to disparate data sources. Leaders face challenges in fully utilizing program information due to disparate data sources, hindering the effective management of weapon system portfolios. The Department of Defense has been hindered by flawed financial management systems, impacting its ability to improve budgetary accounting. Despite efforts to enhance financial systems, some initiatives are not expected to yield significant improvements. The Department of Defense has historically struggled with flawed financial management systems and transaction control weaknesses. Efforts to improve these systems are ongoing, with some initiatives not expected to be complete until 2017. Multiple information technology systems and databases containing similar data can pose challenges for analyzing specific data sets. The Department of Defense has multiple information technology systems and databases with similar data, leading to challenges in data analysis. Calls have been made to improve the architecture of data systems for collecting and managing DOD acquisition data due to unreliable or incomplete information in existing systems. The architecture of data systems for collecting, managing, and analyzing DOD acquisition data faces challenges with unreliable or incomplete information. Instances of insufficient or nonexistent data exist in various DOD data sets, including contract obligations, workforce, contractor past performance, and operations and support costs. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) and Operations and Support costs highlight the difficulties with data reliability and sufficiency in government efforts to improve it. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) is a central database of U.S. government-wide procurement. It is relied upon by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public for understanding government spending. The database plays a crucial role in decision-making processes. The FPDS database is crucial for decision-making by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data, leading to efforts to improve its quality. The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidance for executive branch agencies to enhance the quality of FPDS data, which has been criticized for its limited utility, accuracy, and completeness. Concerns over data reliability have led analysts to use FPDS for identifying trends and rough estimations only. The General Services Administration is undergoing a significant overhaul of data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness through focus groups with stakeholders. The overhaul of data systems, including FPDS, aims to improve reliability and usefulness. Focus groups with stakeholders are being conducted to gather feedback on enhancing the data stored in the systems. Upgrades are expected to be implemented in 2017 or 2018. The overhaul of data systems, including FPDS, is expected to be completed in 2017 or 2018. GAO found that DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs were inconsistent and unreliable, hindering effective oversight. Insufficient data also limited DOD officials' ability to analyze cost growth, identify drivers, and develop cost management plans. The GAO found that DOD officials lacked comprehensive and reliable data to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems. O&S data were incomplete and inconsistently reported, hindering the ability to identify cost drivers and develop cost management plans. DOD components did not consistently track O&S costs against final estimates after systems were fielded. The GAO found that DOD officials lacked comprehensive and reliable data to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems. O&S data were incomplete and inconsistently reported, hindering the ability to identify cost drivers and develop cost management plans. The office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) is now requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S, but it will take years to build a bank of data for conducting analysis. According to DOD, other phases of the acquisition process experience similar data access, quality, and availability problems. Some acquisition phases face data access and quality issues. Reliable data may not reach decisionmakers, leading to decisions based on perceptions. Analysts may lack awareness of certain data or face barriers to access. Data sharing may be hindered by the need for information protection. According to a recent RAND report, there are institutional and cultural barriers to sharing data, such as the stovepiped structure of DoD limiting visibility and information sharing. Institutional structure, bureaucratic incentives, and policy guidance also restrict data access, resulting in conservative data protection measures. The stovepiped structure of DoD limits visibility and information sharing, exacerbated by policy and bureaucratic incentives. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively due to a lack of personnel capable of complex data analysis. Senior leaders within DOD may not understand how to effectively utilize data for decision-making. The DoD lacks personnel for complex data analysis and decision-making. Some senior leaders may not understand how to use data effectively. Unchecked statistics and slick presentations are sometimes used without validation of assumptions. Decisionmakers may ignore data that doesn't support their intended decisions. Some government officials suggest decisionmakers may avoid using data that doesn't support their intended decisions. DOD officials emphasize understanding data limitations and avoiding data collection for its own sake. Some observers caution against collecting data without a clear purpose, as it may lead to a focus on data gathering rather than useful analysis. DOD officials are concerned about spending too much time on data calls that do not serve a practical analytical purpose, diverting attention from program management. DOD officials are concerned about the time spent on data calls that lack analytical purpose, diverting attention from program management. Observers caution that data analysis should outweigh the cost of data collection. Some observers argue that striving for more and better data can hinder effective analysis, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decisionmakers should focus on whether sufficient data exist to draw reasonable conclusions. Critical questions to ask when working with data include what useful analysis can be derived. When working with data, critical questions to ask include what useful analysis can be developed, how to model correctly, and the uncertainty bounds of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating is a prime example of this concept. Even perfect data is unlikely to yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating, such as for large programs like those in Afghanistan, is imprecise but can help decision-makers understand risks and allocate resources. Despite spending over $80 billion from FY2007 to FY2013, accurate tracking of data was lacking. Despite spending over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan from FY2007 to FY2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. government struggled to accurately track data for strategic contracting decisions. Due to a lack of reliable information, the amount of money spent in Afghanistan over the past decade remains unknown. DOD lacked the necessary IT systems to track data effectively, leading to challenges in monitoring relevant contract information. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. government faced challenges in tracking the amount of money spent in Afghanistan over the past decade. DOD lacked IT systems to effectively manage its supply chain, hindering the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter. The lack of necessary data hindered the distribution of supplies and equipment in Afghanistan, affecting operations and limiting oversight of the supply chain. Conflicting information from different systems further complicated the situation. In 2009, Greg Gardner, then-Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO) for the Director of National Intelligence, highlighted the inefficiencies in the U.S. government's 23 different network information technology systems in Afghanistan. These systems were often duplicative, not interoperable, leading to wasteful spending and poor data sharing. Data reliability was questioned as information was often kept at the local level and did not flow up to the central database. Data reliability within agencies was questionable, even when IT systems existed. Information was often kept at the local level and did not flow up to the central database, leading to incomplete and unreliable data. For example, only 14% of approximately 59,000 records contained all required elements for reconstruction projects. Some data areas, like IED attack situation reports, were more accurately tracked. Data from the theatre-wide database showed that only about 14% of records contained all required elements. IED attack situation reports were tracked consistently, but overall, only 10% of data records were entered into the central database with an error rate of approximately 50%. Data managers estimated that only about 10% of data records were put into the central database with a 50% error rate. Officials were often unaware of existing data due to inexperienced task assignments. For example, personnel involved in COIN strategies were unaware of the Central Command quarterly contractor census. DOD officials and civilian personnel developing COIN contracting strategies were unaware of the Central Command quarterly contractor census and FPDS data related to contracting in Afghanistan. DOD acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. Progress has been made in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions. DOD officials in Afghanistan acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. Significant progress has been made in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions. Leveraging data systems for future operations could provide timely access to critical information. Analysts and Senior DOD officials recognize the department's insufficient use of data for decision-making. DOD officials in Afghanistan acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. Significant progress has been made in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions. Efforts are underway to improve IT systems and gather data for policy decisions. The department must value using data to drive decisions and integrate data gathering. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made efforts to gather and analyze data for policy decisions, with a focus on integrating data into the organization's routines. Leadership support is seen as crucial for a successful analytics program. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program in the Department of Defense (DOD). Senior officials have emphasized the need for a data-informed decision-making process, as shown by initiatives like the annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System. The Department of Defense emphasizes data-driven decision-making, as seen in initiatives like the annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System. Senior leadership promotes a more data-driven process for supply chain management, with three comprehensive reports analyzing defense acquisitions. DOD is investing billions in data-driven analyses for defense acquisitions and supply chain management. Senior leadership is promoting this approach, but some argue more action is needed. Efforts are underway to improve data quality and overhaul data systems like FPDS for better reliability. DOD and the federal government are working to improve data quality, with systems like FPDS undergoing overhaul. An analytics center was established in 2013 to analyze data for measuring acquisitions' effectiveness and policy crafting. The analytics center was established to measure acquisitions' effectiveness and craft policy. CAPE launched the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data for easy access and analysis by decision-makers and cost analysts. The CADE project aims to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts to easily access and analyze. The military services are also focusing on better integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Navy reassessing IT systems to determine data needs and the Air Force emphasizing the importance of data analysis. The Air Force has set up the Air Force IT Business Analytics Office to identify potential cost savings, amounting to over $500 million. Congress has been credited with helping the Department of Defense improve data utilization in decision-making processes. The Department of Defense is developing a baseline of past acquisition cost performance and improving data utilization in decision-making processes, with Congress credited for initiatives like The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act. This act focuses on using data to inform decisions early in the acquisition process, strengthening independent cost estimates, developmental test and evaluation, and systems engineering. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act, established to improve cost estimates in defense acquisition, requires DOD to conduct root cause analysis for programs with cost growth exceeding thresholds. Additionally, the act mandates DOD to be audit-ready for financial statements validation. The FY2010 NDAA requires DOD to ensure financial statements are audit-ready for validation, aiming to improve efficiency and resource deployment despite past challenges in data-based decision-making. Despite efforts to improve data-based decision-making, success is not guaranteed in making DOD more efficient. Past attempts to enhance efficiency and management have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command but also failures such as the Air Force's cancelled ERP system after spending over $1 billion. The Navy's Air System Command is cited as a success, but the Air Force's ERP system was cancelled after spending $1 billion. It will take years for DOD to improve data systems and decision-making culture. Historic data scarcity makes it hard to assess contemporary observations accurately. A robust historical database is needed. Our ability to affect decisions with data may take years to accomplish due to historic data scarcity. Building a robust historical database is crucial to understand long term trends in the DOD acquisition system. Knee-jerk reactions to short term events may occur without a firm understanding of these trends. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasized the importance of promoting efficiency in the DOD. The success of promoting data use in decision-making at the Department of Defense depends on congressional support. Congress could allocate resources to build necessary systems and workforce, and pass legislation to influence decision-making processes, similar to the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Congress could support building systems and workforce for data gathering and analysis, similar to the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. To improve defense acquisitions, Congress may need to invest in IT systems and analytical capabilities. Congress may need to invest in IT systems and analytical capabilities to improve defense acquisitions. This includes considering building analytical capability within DOD offices and examining DOD's strategy for data needs and technology deployment. Congress may need to invest in IT systems and analytical capabilities to improve defense acquisitions, including building analytical capability within DOD offices. To effectively use data, DOD must have a clear strategy for data needs, technology deployment, in-house capability for data analysis, hiring qualified personnel, and potentially contracting out such capabilities. A culture that supports data utilization is also crucial. To effectively use data in decision-making, DOD needs a culture that values data-driven decisions and integrates data analysis into standard routines. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use and should assess DOD's culture for fostering data utilization. Congress could consider legislation to promote the use of data in decision-making within the Department of Defense (DOD). Key considerations include assessing DOD's culture for fostering data utilization, examining incentives that may promote or inhibit data use, incorporating data gathering into routine processes, and developing a clear strategy for using data analytics to improve acquisitions and business operations. A recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within the government. The RAND report found inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within the government, raising questions about DOD's strategy for using data analytics to improve operations. Congress may need to address how DOD balances data-sharing for efficiency with information security concerns."
