    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Conflicts from Political Fundraising Act of 2017\". Congress finds that public confidence in the Federal Government relies on officers and employees avoiding conflicts of interest. This includes nominees or appointees to Senate-confirmed positions who have ties to political entities. Since the 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision, corporate political spending has significantly increased, with some contributions made to entities organized under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code.

Financial disclosure requirements do not cover donations to political entities. The issue of political spending transparency is raised, as current financial disclosure requirements do not cover donations to political action committees or entities organized under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
