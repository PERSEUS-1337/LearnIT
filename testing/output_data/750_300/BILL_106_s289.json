RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term 'program participant' refers to a public or private entity that has received a direct award or subaward, regardless of whether they provide program services. This includes entities that only participate in a program to provide services. Private entities that have received designated direct awards or subawards, regardless of their role in providing program services, are considered program participants. This includes entities that solely provide program services through voucherized assistance. The purpose of allowing religious organizations to participate in programs is to ensure they are treated equally to other nonprofit providers without compromising their religious character or the religious freedom of program beneficiaries.

This includes nondiscrimination in employment based on religion, with exceptions for religious organizations. Religious organizations in social-welfare programs are not required to change their internal rules or symbols. They can still adhere to their religious beliefs and practices, including rules on drug and alcohol use for employees. This does not affect discrimination laws based on religion. The rights of program beneficiaries include the ability to object to receiving services from a religious organization. If the organization received a designated direct award, they must arrange for the individual to receive program services through an alternative provider.

If a religious organization received a designated direct award, they must arrange for the individual to receive program services through an alternative entity.

The organization must not discriminate in providing program services, except as allowed by law. \"A religious organization as a program participant must not discriminate against a program beneficiary based on religion, except as allowed by law.\" The program participant must allow a program beneficiary to actively participate in religious activities and follow religious rules of behavior. Religious organizations must adhere to fiscal accountability guidelines. Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations, including auditing principles for fund usage. Religious organizations receiving federal funds must comply with auditing regulations. If the organization keeps federal funds separate from non-federal funds, only the federal funds are subject to audit. Organizations can seek judicial review of agency actions for compliance with these regulations. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is redeemed. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of programs and treatment of funds. (a) Funds provided under a designated program are aid to the beneficiary, not the organization offering services. Program beneficiaries receiving services at an organization's facilities do not constitute federal financial assistance to the organization. (b) States cannot prohibit the use of federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in the program. Federal funds under a designated program can be spent in a religious facility or by a religious organization, even if State laws would prohibit the use of State or local public funds in such places. The State or local government must separate Federal funds from other public funds for the designated program. SEC. 585 outlines educational requirements for personnel in drug treatment programs. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may undermine effectiveness and hinder service provision. If a program participant imposes educational requirements, religious education must be considered. If a State or local government program participant imposes educational qualifications on providers of program services, including religious organizations, they must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel in delivering services. Religious education should be given equivalent credit to secular education in the qualifications for personnel in religious organizations. In applying educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations, State or local government must give credit for religious education equivalent to secular course work in drug treatment or similar subjects. Program participants can establish educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing program services, with restrictions on discrimination requirements. The State or local government can set educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing program services to reduce drug use among beneficiaries. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for religious organizations if deemed necessary. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for religious organizations if certain conditions are met, such as a successful drug treatment record for at least 3 years and a demonstrated need to waive the qualifications. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for religious organizations if they have a successful drug treatment record for at least 3 years, have applied for a waiver, and the government has not proven the necessity of the qualifications for the program's success."
