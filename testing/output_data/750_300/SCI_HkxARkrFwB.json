    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing all word embedding vectors in a dictionary requires a lot of space and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for storing word embedding matrices during training. Innovative methods word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices, reducing storage space by a hundred-fold or more without sacrificing accuracy in NLP tasks. Modern deep learning approaches for natural language processing rely on vector representation of words to convert human language into a continuous space for neural network processing. One-hot representation maps each word to a row in an identity matrix, but word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use vectors instead. Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use vectors of dimensionality much smaller than d to represent words, capturing semantic relationships and allowing downstream neural network layers to be of width proportional to p. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix needs to be explicitly stored. The embeddings are trained on large text corpora to capture semantic relationships between words. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix needs to be stored in GPU memory for efficient access during training and inference. Vocabulary sizes can reach d = 10^5 or 10^6, with embedding dimensionality ranging from p = 300 to p = 1024. The embedding matrix becomes a substantial part of the parameter space in a learning model. The dimensionality of embeddings in current systems ranges from p = 300 to p = 1024. The embedding matrix is a significant part of the parameter space in a learning model. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. In quantum computing, a qubit is represented by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. Entanglement allows qubits in a register to be interconnected, leading to an exponential dimensionality of the state space. This phenomenon is unique to quantum systems and distinguishes them from classical bits. Entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon where quantum bits are interconnected, unlike classical bits. Quantum registers can be approximated classically, but with a loss of representation power. This loss does not significantly impact NLP machine learning. The paper introduces two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, to efficiently store word embedding matrices for NLP machine learning algorithms. These methods operate independently on each word's embedding, allowing for more efficient processing. The paper introduces word2ket and word2ketXS methods for storing word embedding matrices efficiently in NLP tasks. These methods operate independently on word embeddings, offering high space saving rates with minimal impact on model accuracy. The new word2ket embeddings provide high space saving rates with minimal impact on model accuracy in NLP tasks. Tensor product spaces V \u2297 W are constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W, with defined addition and multiplication properties. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w, with ||v \u2297 w|| = ||v|| ||w|| for unit-norm vectors from V and W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The tensor product space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, where {cv} \u2297 w and v \u2297 {cw} are equivalent ways to write the same vector. A vector in a tensor product space is often called a tensor. Orthonormal basis sets {\u03c8 j } and {\u03c6 k } in V and W, respectively, lead to the Kronecker delta \u03b4 z, equal to one at z = 0 and null elsewhere. The tensor product space V \u2297 W consists of orthonormal basis sets {\u03c8 j } and {\u03c6 k }, forming an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k } in V \u2297 W. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W, and we can create tensor product spaces by multiple applications of tensor product. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is formed by adding pairs of vectors in new spaces by coefficients. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2n is written as |u and called a ket. The tensor product space H = V \u2297 W is of tensor order 3 of n. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, but it may not always be possible to express them as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 for some \u03c6 \u2208 V, \u03c8 \u2208 W. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, but it may not always be possible to express them as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 for some \u03c6 \u2208 V, \u03c8 \u2208 W. Tensors with rank greater than one are of order n and are not always expressible in the form \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. In tensor product spaces, tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is not generally known. A p-dimensional word embedding model maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space, trained to capture semantic information. A p-dimensional word embedding model involves mapping word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. The model represents embeddings of individual words as entangled tensors in word2ket. In word2ket, word embeddings are represented as entangled tensors with a tensor of rank r and order n. The resulting vector has dimension p = qn, taking up space O(rq log q log p) where q \u2265 4 to avoid loss of information. The calculation of inner product between two p-dimensional word embeddings, v and w, represented via word2ket takes O (rq log q log p) time and O (1) additional space. In most applications, a small number of embedding vectors do need to be made available for processing through subsequent neural network. In applications, a small number of embedding vectors are required for processing through neural network layers. For a batch of b words, the space requirement is O (bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single p-dimensional word embedding from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O (rn log 2 p) operations. The proposed word embedding representation involves efficient arithmetic operations, utilizing a tensor product tree for parallel processing. This approach reduces sequential processing time to O(log2n) for n=4, enhancing training efficiency with gradient descent.

This approach enhances training efficiency with gradient descent by performing multiplications in parallel along branches of the tree. The proposed word embedding representation uses a tensor product tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing time to O(log2n). To address potential issues with high Lipschitz constant of the gradient, LayerNorm is applied at each node in the tree. Linear operators A and B are defined, and a mapping A \u2297 B is introduced as a linear operator. Linear operators A and B are defined to map vectors from Hilbert spaces V and W into U and Y, respectively. The tensor product of A and B, denoted as A \u2297 B, maps vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. In the finite-dimensional case, A \u2297 B can be represented as an mn \u00d7 mn matrix composed of blocks a jk B. In the context of linear operators mapping vectors from different spaces, the tensor product of operators is bilinear. In the finite-dimensional case, the tensor product can be represented as a matrix composed of blocks. Word embeddings in a p-dimensional model can be seen as a linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to embedding vectors. This operator can be represented by a matrix storing the word embeddings. The word embedding linear operator in word2ketXS represents the d \u00d7 p word embedding matrix efficiently, taking up O(rq log qt log t log p log d) space. The word embedding matrix in word2ketXS is represented by a series of linear operators, achieving space efficiency through tensor product-based exponential compression. This method allows for efficient multiplication by weight matrices in neural NLP models.

These embeddings were tested in NLP tasks like text summarization, language translation, and question answering, showing comparable accuracy to regular embeddings. In text summarization experiments, the proposed space-efficient embeddings were compared with regular embeddings using a GIGAWORD dataset. An encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence architecture was utilized with bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder. Internal layers had a dimensionality of 256. The study utilized an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence architecture with bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder. Internal layers had a dimensionality of 256 and dropout rate of 0.2. Models were trained for 20 epochs and evaluated using Rouge 1, 2, and L scores. Different dimensionality values were explored, with results presented in Table 1. The study compared different dimensionality values for the model and found that word2ketXS achieved a significant reduction in trainable parameters while maintaining similar Rouge scores compared to word2ket. This led to a focus on word2ketXS for further evaluation in NLP tasks. In the evaluation of NLP tasks, word2ketXS showed a 34,000 fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight decrease in Rouge scores. The study also explored German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset, measuring performance with BLEU score. Different embedding dimensions were tested for the sequence-to-sequence model. The study explored different embedding dimensions for a sequence-to-sequence model using BLEU score for evaluation. Results showed a drop in BLEU score with parameter space reduction. Another task involved using DrQA's model for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset. The study used DrQA's model with a 3-layer bidirectional LSTMs for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset. Training for 40 epochs, they reported a test set F1 score with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and embedding dimensionality of 300. Results in Table 3 showed a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with a 1000-fold saving of parameter space. The study reported a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with a 1000-fold saving of parameter space for word2ketXS embeddings. For order-4 tensor word2ketXS, there was a 10^5-fold space saving rate with a less than 3% drop in F1 score. The training time for the word2ketXS-based model increased from 5.8 to 7.4 hours for tensors order 2. The study found that using word2ketXS embeddings led to a decrease in memory footprint for the model, with training times increasing to 7.4 hours for order-2 tensors and 9 hours for order-4 tensors. The model training dynamics remained largely unchanged despite the increased training time. The experiments showed significant reductions in memory usage for word embeddings in the model, particularly in the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. This reduction did not affect other parameters like weight matrices or word probabilities. During inference, memory usage is dominated by embedding and other layers. During inference, memory usage is dominated by embedding and other layers in transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers, which require hundreds of millions of parameters to work. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of parameters are for word embeddings. Training also requires additional memory for storing activations in all layers. During training, memory usage is dominated by storing activations in all layers for calculating gradients. Decreasing the memory required for word embeddings is crucial due to hardware limitations. Various approaches have been used to lower space requirements.

Pruning and quantization have been used to compress models for low-memory inference, while approaches for low-memory training include sparsity and low numerical precision methods. Fourier-based approximation methods have also been utilized. None of these approaches can match the space-saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. In matrix approximation, various approaches have been proposed, including Fourier-based methods. However, none of these methods can achieve the space-saving rates of word2ketXS. Other methods, such as bit encoding and parameter sharing, have limitations in terms of space saving rates. Tensor product spaces have also been explored in document analysis. Based on parameter sharing or PCA, higher saving rates are possible but limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have been used for document embeddings through sketching of n-grams in the document."
