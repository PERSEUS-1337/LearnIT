    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regional Comprehensive Emergency Preparedness, Coordination, and Recovery Act of 2002\". Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks required coordination and support from various jurisdictions, including local elected officials, neighboring jurisdictions, and regional, state, federal, and private sector entities due to the large number of agencies involved in emergency response. Regional planning and coordination of response efforts involving various jurisdictions, state, federal, and private sector entities are crucial for effective emergency response to minimize loss of life and property damage. Regional councils of governments, planning commissions, and development districts play a key role in coordinating comprehensive regional plans. Regional councils of governments, planning commissions, and development districts have the accountability and experience to coordinate comprehensive regional plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders for community security. They can ensure the development of coordinated emergency preparedness and recovery plans. Area-wide training and equipment acquisition are also emphasized. Regional councils of government play a crucial role in developing coordinated emergency preparedness and recovery plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and facilitate the implementation of regional emergency preparedness and coordination plans to enhance preparedness and mitigation efforts.

Environmental Protection Agency thresholds, major concentrations of munitions and explosives, potential targets like nuclear power plants, identification of debris disposal locations and health hazards for personnel involved in debris disposal. Planning activities related to these. Planning activities under this section involve analyzing the possibility of a disaster, assessing hazards using Geographic Information Systems, and evaluating potential consequences. The regional plan must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and the Governor. The regional plan for assessing hazards and evaluating consequences of emergencies must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving a planning grant.
