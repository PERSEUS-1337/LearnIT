    "content": "Services are a diverse group of economic activities that involve providing human value-added in various forms. They are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Rapid changes in technology are reducing these restrictions on services. Services are intangible and must be consumed at the point of production. Technology is reducing restrictions on services, such as computer software and online accounting. Examples of services include wholesale and retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, healthcare, and public administration. The service sector in the U.S. economy includes banking, insurance, professional services, education, arts, healthcare, food services, construction, communication, and public administration. In 2010, the service sector accounted for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP. Financial services play a crucial role in the economy by facilitating the flow of capital. Financial services, delivery services, and distribution services are crucial for the economy as they facilitate the flow of capital, ensure goods are available when needed, and make goods available to consumers. Inefficiencies in these industries could have adverse consequences for the whole economy. Distribution services (retail and wholesale services) are essential for making goods available to consumers. U.S. trade in services plays a significant role in overall U.S. trade, accounting for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports in 2010. Many service providers prefer to establish a presence in the country of the consumer due to the direct contact required for most services. U.S. trade in services accounts for 30% of total exports and 17% of total imports. Service providers often establish a presence in the consumer's country for direct contact. Legal, accounting, and construction services require proximity to clients and knowledge of local laws. Cross-border services trade data may not capture all service transactions. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, which is more than U.S. cross-border exports. Foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services. This does not capture the total value of trade in services, which also includes the temporary movement of consumers and providers. The Trade Act of 1974 instructed the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the Tokyo Round negotiations, which concluded in 1979 without a services agreement. Seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted over a quarter century ago. U.S. data on sales of services through temporary movement of consumers and providers are not readily available. During the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979, there was no agreement on trade in services. Industrialized countries, led by the United States, pushed for services to be included in later negotiations, while developing countries were hesitant due to less advanced service sectors. Services were eventually included in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, where new rules for services were agreed upon by GATT members. During the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, services were included as part of the agreement, leading to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the new rules. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identified three main challenges in constructing rules for international trade in services. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identified three main challenges in constructing rules for international trade in services: targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. The challenges in constructing rules for international trade in services include targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. Another challenge is the impact of technology advances, such as the internet, making once non-tradable services tradable and leading to the outsourcing of services across borders. These challenges call for flexible yet disciplined rules to govern WTO members' activities. The GATS recognizes that most services transactions occur within borders, with barriers inside customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider different modes of delivery to identify barriers foreign service providers face. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four categories. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four categories to identify barriers foreign service providers face when selling in a trade-partner's market. One of the modes is cross-border supply (mode 1), where the service is supplied from one country to another without the supplier and consumer crossing the border. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four categories to identify barriers foreign service providers face when selling in a trade-partner's market. One of the modes is cross-border supply (mode 1), where the service is supplied from one country to another without the supplier and consumer crossing the border. In consumption abroad (mode 2), the consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service. Commercial presence (mode 3) involves the supplier establishing a branch, agency, or wholly owned subsidiary in another country to supply services to the local market. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four categories to identify barriers foreign service providers face when selling in a trade-partner's market. Presence of natural persons (mode 4) involves individual suppliers traveling temporarily to the country of the consumer. The GATS is an agreement among the 153 WTO members representing many levels of economic development, providing a multilateral framework of principles. The GATS is a multilateral agreement among 153 WTO members that sets out principles and rules for government policies affecting trade in services. It aims to promote trade expansion, progressive liberalization, and the right of member governments to regulate services sectors. The GATS aims to promote trade expansion, progressive liberalization, and the right of member governments to regulate services sectors. It is divided into six parts, with Part I defining the scope and application of the agreement to all services and government barriers at all levels. The GATS applies to all services, excluding those under government authority, and all government trade barriers at national, regional, and local levels. It covers all modes of service delivery and includes principles and obligations for all service sectors, regardless of being listed in a member's commitments schedule. This includes unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, ensuring imported services are not discriminated against. The GATS includes key principles such as most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, impartial administration of rules, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. Exceptions are also outlined for members facing balance of payments difficulties. The GATS establishes regulations for the administration of government rules and regulations, including market access and national treatment obligations for members. Exceptions are outlined for balance of payments difficulties and national security purposes. The GATS (Articles XVI-XVIII) establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to their commitments. It prohibits less favorable treatment than committed to and limits on foreign service suppliers in various aspects. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring that service suppliers from other member countries receive national treatment and allowing for further negotiations to reduce barriers to trade in services. Unlike other principles, national treatment and market access obligations are restricted. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring service providers receive equal treatment. These obligations apply only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments, known as the positive list approach. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members in the services sector. Obligations do not apply to services sectors outside the schedule of commitments, known as the positive list approach. Parts IV-VI of the agreement require new negotiations to expand coverage and resolve conflicts between members. The GATS requires WTO members to start new negotiations to expand coverage of the agreement within five years of its implementation. Conflicts involving GATS implementation are resolved through the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The agreement also includes annexes on various services sectors and a schedule of commitments from each member. The GATS allows governments to take actions to protect investors and maintain the national financial system. It includes commitments from each WTO member and ongoing negotiations on financial, telecommunication, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. The GATS allowed for negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with limited results, while negotiations on maritime services concluded in June 1996 without resolution. Commitments made by WTO members on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of the agreements. In 1995, negotiations on maritime services ended without conclusion and were to resume in the current round. WTO members make commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors under the GATS. Each member must submit a schedule of commitments during negotiations, with new members required to do so upon accession to the WTO. The schedule of commitments (SC) is a requirement for WTO members during negotiations of the GATS. New members must submit a schedule upon accession to the WTO. The SC is part of the GATS and is more complex than tariff schedules, divided into four columns detailing sector commitments and market access restrictions. The schedule of commitments in the GATS is divided into four columns detailing sector commitments, market access restrictions, national treatment restrictions, and additional commitments made by the member country. It is also divided into two parts, with the first part focusing on horizontal commitments that apply to all services sectors and subsectors listed in the schedule. The GATS schedule of commitments is divided into two parts. The first part includes horizontal commitments that apply to all services sectors and subsectors, while the second part lists sector-specific commitments. The negotiations in the DDA on services have two main objectives. The negotiations in the DDA on services aim to reform GATS rules and expand commitments for trade liberalization. Members must identify exceptions for market access and national treatment in each sector and subsector. The goal is to increase coverage of service sectors and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. The evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations are discussed, along with U.S. and other major trading partners' objectives. The negotiations in the DDA on services aim to reform GATS rules and expand commitments for trade liberalization by increasing coverage of service sectors and reducing limitations on national treatment and market access. The evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations are discussed, along with U.S. and other major trading partners' objectives. Article XIX of the GATS mandates WTO members to start new negotiations on services within five years of the GATS coming into force. These negotiations aim to address issues like special treatment for least developed countries, government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and countervailing actions. The GATS mandates negotiations on government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The new services negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to the adverse political climate after the 1999 WTO Ministerial in Seattle. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the current set of negotiations. The WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines in March 2001 for the current set of negotiations on progressive liberalization of trade in services, recognizing members' sovereign right to regulate the sector. The main objective is the progressive liberalization of trade in services to promote economic growth while respecting members' right to regulate the sector. All service sectors and delivery modes are subject to negotiations, with safeguards measures to be completed by the end of the DDA. Negotiations are conducted in special sessions open to all WTO members, starting from scheduled commitments. Negotiations for the progressive liberalization of trade in services are conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services, open to all WTO members. The \"request-offer\" format is used for negotiating new commitments, with special attention given to the needs of developing countries. Modalities were adopted on September 3, 2003, including negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization. The WTO members negotiate commitments and modalities for trade liberalization, including negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization. DDA was successfully launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle. The Ministerial Declaration folded services negotiation into the DDA round agenda. The DDA round of WTO negotiations was launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle. The Ministerial Declaration included deadlines for market access and national treatment commitments, but the services negotiations floundered as deadlines passed. The DDA negotiations faced challenges with services negotiations missing deadlines. The round was at risk of collapse in September 2003, but a negotiating framework was agreed upon in July 2004 to put the round back on track. In July 2004, WTO members agreed on a negotiating framework to revive the DDA round. The framework aimed to ensure timely submission of high-quality offers, addressing concerns about missed deadlines and poor offer quality. Services were briefly mentioned in the framework. The DDA negotiators aimed to ensure timely submission of high-quality offers in response to complaints from WTO officials. Services were briefly mentioned in the July framework, placing them on par with negotiations on agriculture and market access for non-agricultural goods. Negotiations on rules are conducted by working groups, while national treatment and market access commitments are addressed by all members using the request-offer format. Negotiations on rules and market access for non-agricultural goods in the WTO involve working groups of representatives from interested members. Members use the request-offer format for national treatment and market access commitments. Each member submits a wish-list of commitments they want others to offer, followed by negotiations and revised offers until a consensus is reached. The negotiations in the WTO for services involve members responding with their commitment offers, which are negotiated through bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions until consensus is reached. All members must accept the final set of commitment offers to become part of the GATS. The WTO services negotiations, including \"request-offer\" negotiations, involve bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions among members. These negotiations have been ongoing for over five years but have faced delays and disappointing results, leading to the suspension of the DDA negotiations in 2006 due to disagreements on fundamental modalities in agriculture trade. In July 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations, including services negotiations, due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Negotiations resumed in 2007 but have not reached consensus on basic objectives. Major developed and developing countries continue to work on a draft text, facing challenges in reaching agreement. The United States and chief trading partners have not reached a consensus on negotiating objectives for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Round. The US presented its goals in 2002, aiming to secure market access commitments. Negotiations have faced challenges in reaching agreement. The main U.S. goal in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations is to secure market access commitments from trading partners. U.S. policymakers also aim to address concerns about the market openness levels agreed upon in previous rounds of negotiations. The Uruguay Round commitments were not as liberal as the existing market environment, with WTO members hesitant to bind market openness at current levels. The U.S. urges countries to raise bindings to prevent slippage. Government regulation is more prevalent in services trade than in goods trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to protect consumers. In services trade, government regulation is more prevalent than in goods trade. GATS rules acknowledge the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety, such as verifying qualifications for professions like lawyers and doctors. Service sectors are regulated by various government agencies at different administrative levels. The service sector is regulated by multiple government agencies at different levels. Service providers, whether domestic or foreign, must understand regulations to conduct business. Lack of transparency in regulations is a barrier to foreign trade, especially in developing countries. The United States urges WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for trade in services. The United States is pushing for WTO member countries to establish clear domestic procedures for application and renewal of licenses, inform the public of regulations before they take effect, and allow for public input on regulatory changes. The United States is advocating for WTO members to eliminate unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, such as limits on the forms of investment. U.S. negotiators are urging WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including limits on investment forms. They are seeking commitments to improve market access, transparency, and fairness in financial services regulations, with a focus on insurance. The United States is requesting trading partners to improve market access in financial services, transparency in regulations, and fairness in applying regulations. Specifically, they proposed commitments to expedite new-to-market initiatives in insurance and increase market access in telecommunications services. Additionally, they are seeking commitments made in the 1998 Telecommunications Agreement and privatization of telecommunications carriers. The US also requested market access commitments for owning and leasing cable facilities and increased access for road freight. The United States has requested market access commitments for owning and leasing cable facilities, increased access for road freight transport, order processing services, and inventory management services. They also asked WTO members to address the issue of cross-subsidization of express delivery services. The United States has requested increased market access to energy services markets, including energy exploration, transmission, distribution, marketing, trading, conservation, and anti-pollution services. They also seek commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities. The United States has requested increased market access to energy services, including exploration, transmission, distribution, marketing, trading, conservation, and anti-pollution services. They also seek commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities and prioritize environmental protection in services negotiations. The United States has requested increased market access for various environmental services, including wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity protection. They also seek full market access for retail, wholesale, and franchising services, as well as education and training services. The United States has requested increased market access for various services, including education and training services such as job-related courses. They also seek market access for foreign lawyers, accountants, and other professional service providers by removing citizenship requirements and ownership restrictions. The United States is asking trading partners to increase market access for foreign professional services by removing citizenship requirements, ownership restrictions, and other barriers. They also seek improved market access for computer, audiovisual, and advertising services. The United States is requesting improved market access for computer and related services, including consulting, software development, data processing, and systems integration. They also seek better market access commitments for audiovisual and advertising services. The U.S. presented initial and revised offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The United States presented initial and revised offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers, meeting the deadline set in the July 2004 Framework. The offers would commit the U.S. to maintain current levels of trade liberalization in services markets, which are already quite open and competitive. The United States defends its offers by stating that its services markets are already open and competitive, expecting WTO members to meet U.S. standards. U.S. offers include horizontal commitments applying to all sectors listed in the schedule of commitments. The U.S. offers include horizontal commitments that apply to all sectors listed in the schedule of commitments, such as temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S. for no longer than 90 days. The United States allows temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S., including sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, and personnel establishing a business entity. Fashion models and service providers in specialty occupations are also permitted temporary entry. The United States allows temporary entry for specific groups working for foreign firms, including sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, and personnel establishing a business entity. Foreigners engaged in providing scheduled services are taxed the same as U.S. residents with a few exceptions. Additionally, personnel engaged in the acquisition of land in scheduled services sectors are permitted temporary entry. Federally owned land in the United States is restricted to U.S. citizens. Taxation measures for foreigners providing scheduled services are similar to those for U.S. residents, with some exceptions. The U.S. has made scheduled commitments in various sectors, including business services like professional services, accounting, taxation, and architectural and engineering services. WTO members must identify any national treatment and market access exceptions for each delivery mode in the scheduled sectors. Exceptions in business services mostly pertain to state regulations. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors, including business services, market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, and express delivery. Exceptions in business services mainly involve state restrictions on foreign service providers. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, express delivery, telecommunication services, wholesale and retail trade services, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, recreational and cultural services, transportation services, energy services, and construction. Developing countries have criticized the United States for not offering broader commitments in various services sectors, arguing that the sectors in which the US has offered commitments are not useful to them. The European Union has also criticized the US for not opening maritime and postal services to foreign competition. The United States has faced criticism for its limited commitments in services sectors, with developing countries and some developed countries focusing on the restricted nature of U.S. offers under the mode-4 category. India, for example, argues for access for software specialists and information technology engineers. India argues for access to software specialists, computer experts, and information technology engineers under mode-4, which has been a contentious issue in the DDA negotiations. Deadlines for procedural steps have been rescheduled due to the complexity of the negotiations. The DDA negotiations have faced delays in meeting deadlines for procedural steps, with the complexity of the negotiations being a major factor. Some suggest that the \"request-offer\" negotiating format is hindering progress. The US and EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" for targeted sectors to facilitate commitments. The United States and the EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" for targeted sectors in WTO negotiations, with the US advocating for commitments in six core sectors and the EU suggesting a smaller list. Developing countries opposed the \"benchmark\" proposals, arguing it was too late in the negotiation process. The EU argued for a smaller list of core sectors for members to choose commitments from, facing opposition from many developing countries who believed it was too late to change the negotiation format. Developing countries also expressed concerns that the proposed benchmarks would likely favor sectors preferred by developed countries. Some developing countries and the U.S. services business community expressed concerns about benchmarks potentially favoring sectors favored by developed countries. The United States proposed changes to the negotiating process to accelerate negotiations on services. Canada, supported by the United States and other developed countries, proposed changes to the negotiating process to boost services negotiations. The United States suggested countries clearly identify concessions before completing agriculture and non-agricultural talks. Developing countries rejected the proposal and insisted on maintaining the current sequencing. Developing countries have rejected proposed changes to the negotiating process that would prioritize services negotiations over agriculture and non-agricultural talks. The positive list approach for market access commitments has also faced criticism for potentially hindering market access liberalization. The primary criticism of the negotiating process is that it could hinder market access liberalization by not covering new sectors unless specifically identified. However, this approach is seen as a way to encourage reluctant members, especially developing countries, to participate. The United States prefers the \"negative list\" approach in free trade agreements. Mode-4 delivery, temporary entry of supply personnel, is a contentious issue in the current negotiations. The United States favors the \"negative list\" approach in free trade agreements, which has caused controversy over mode-4 delivery in services negotiations. This issue has divided developed and developing countries, leading to criticism of the U.S. despite mode-4 accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services. Tension has arisen between the U.S. government and business community as a result. Despite accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services, mode-4 delivery has sparked criticism from developing countries towards the United States. This controversy is linked to immigration policies and has caused tension between the U.S. government and business community. The issue of mode-4 delivery is closely tied to the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, as the U.S. has tightened restrictions in response. The United States has tightened restrictions post-9/11. Mode-4 in GATS involves service supply by natural persons. Developing countries criticize the US for visa restrictions on mode-4 commitments. India is particularly critical. Several developing countries, including India, have criticized the United States for visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the country under mode-4 commitments. India specifically calls for greater transparency in U.S. immigration regulations for temporary personnel. The mode-4 issue has also become a matter of congressional authority during the implementation of trade agreements. The mode-4 issue has become a matter of congressional authority during the implementation of trade agreements, with objections raised regarding changes in U.S. visa policies for temporary workers entering the country. Compromises were made to separate visa rule changes from trade legislation considered by Congress. The U.S. business community has pushed for changes in visa policies to increase worker quotas entering the United States, separate from trade legislation. Compromises were made to allow separate votes on the two bills, with bipartisan warnings against including visa policy changes in trade agreements. Business groups argue that flexibility in mode-4 offers is necessary for successful negotiations with developing countries. The U.S. business community emphasizes the need for flexibility in mode-4 offers in trade agreements to progress negotiations with developing countries. However, little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures in services, which are crucial for East Asian developing countries. Negotiators are struggling to define countervailable subsidies and their measurement. Negotiators are facing challenges in defining countervailable subsidies and measuring import surges for safeguard measures in services, especially for East Asian developing countries. Despite over 10 years of negotiations, little progress has been made in the services sector, with offers from WTO members, particularly developing countries, remaining largely unchanged from commitments made under the Uruguay agreement. After more than 10 years of negotiations, little progress has been made in services sector at WTO. Offers from many members, especially developing countries, have not changed much from commitments made under the Uruguay Round. A World Bank assessment found that current offers are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies, showing reluctance to bind trade in services and leaving room for more restrictions without violating WTO commitments. After more than a decade of negotiations, little progress has been made in the services sector at the WTO. Current offers are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies, indicating a reluctance to bind trade in services and leaving room for additional restrictions without violating WTO commitments. The DDA, including services negotiations, was suspended indefinitely in 2006 after the G-6 WTO members failed to agree on basic conditions for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Although negotiations resumed in 2007, progress has been slow. In 2006, the G-6 WTO members, including the United States, the European Union, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and India, failed to agree on conditions for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Progress in services negotiations has been slow due to the divide between developed and developing countries in the services sector. The lack of progress in services negotiations at the WTO is attributed to the division between developed and developing countries. Developed nations are more open to market competition, while developing countries are protective of their domestic services providers. The slow progress is also linked to the stalled agriculture and NAMA negotiations, with some developing countries demanding reductions in agriculture subsidies from the United States and the European Union. The lack of progress in services negotiations at the WTO is due to the division between developed and developing countries. Developing countries demand reductions in agriculture subsidies from the United States and the European Union before improving their offers. The complexity of the services negotiations and the number of players involved also contribute to the slow progress. The lack of progress in services negotiations at the WTO is attributed to the division between developed and developing countries, as well as the complexity of the agenda and the numerous participants involved. Services negotiations encompass a wide range of economic activities with varying trade barriers, posing a significant challenge in formulating trade rules. The involvement of regulatory agencies, many of whom do not prioritize trade liberalization, further complicates the prospects for the negotiations. The services negotiations at the WTO involve many participants, including trade ministers and regulatory agencies. The progress of the negotiations is difficult to assess as participants often wait until crucial deadlines to reveal their best negotiating positions. The completion of the negotiations depends on factors such as political will and willingness of participants to overcome obstacles. The completion of WTO services negotiations depends on factors like political will, willingness to compromise, and resolving issues in agriculture and market access. WTO trade ministers met in Hong Kong in December 2005 to work on modalities for the negotiations. In December 2005, WTO trade ministers met in Hong Kong to work on modalities for completing the services negotiations, aiming to conclude by the end of 2006. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration reaffirmed commitment to finish the negotiations with special consideration for developing countries. Annex C provided parameters for the negotiations, with the chairman of trade in services leading discussions in September 2007. In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations initiated the development of a draft agreement text, urging member-country negotiators to contribute. However, by the end of 2007, countries remained divided on key objectives. Developed nations, like the United States, pushed for commitments to bind current trade practices, while developing countries, such as Argentina, had differing views. At the end of 2007, countries were still divided on trade objectives. Developed nations, led by the United States, wanted binding commitments on trade in services. Developing countries, like Argentina, resisted without greater reductions in agriculture subsidies. WTO Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva in July 2008 to address these issues. In July 2008, WTO General Director Lamy organized a ministerial meeting in Geneva to discuss agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives, including the US and EU, to gauge offers and expectations. Despite some areas of possible commitment, negotiations did not progress. In 2009, WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings to generate momentum with limited results, especially in services. The WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings in 2009 to try to generate momentum in negotiations, but little progress was made. In 2010, the services negotiations were stagnant due to reluctance to go beyond current levels of liberalization. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the Doha services negotiations being bogged down. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the stalled Doha services negotiations, emphasizing the need for a strong services package to move forward."
