    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Net metering, encouraged by Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, promotes distributed generation by allowing electric energy generated on-site to offset energy provided by the utility. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar in the nation's electricity system. State net metering policies are important for congressional discussions on renewable energy sources like solar. Solar PV accounts for 97% of net metering capacity in 2018. Federal and state policies, such as tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards, can impact the deployment of distributed solar energy. Some states have modified their net metering policies. Some Members of Congress are interested in how states have modified net metering policies and their impact on stakeholders. Recent state policy changes may either expand or slow down solar energy development. Congress could potentially intervene by restricting, encouraging, or requiring state policy modifications based on their priorities. This report discusses current issues related to net metering policy, which determines how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they deliver to the grid. Congress could potentially take action on state net metering policies, such as restricting, encouraging, or requiring certain policy modifications, depending on their priorities. Net metering is a policy where electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid. It involves a one-to-one compensation for electricity purchased from the grid and electricity delivered to the grid. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, where a utility buys all electricity generated by the customer. Net metering allows customers with distributed generation to be compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid. Policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. The term net metering is used to refer to these policies as they are closely related. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer compensation for electricity delivered to the grid. Some states have alternatives to net energy metering, and some utilities voluntarily offer net metering service to customers. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of U.S. electricity customers. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. According to EIA, about 1% of U.S. electricity customers participated in net metering in 2018, with the number of customers increasing from 2013. Data before 2013 also showed growth in participation, but EIA changed its reporting method. Net metering participation can be measured in various ways, such as total capacity or electricity delivered to the grid. Levels of participation vary by state. According to EIA data, net metering participation varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies and renewable portfolio standards. The state's net metering programs have over 15% customer participation. Factors influencing participation rates include state policies, renewable portfolio standards, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. The process of setting electricity rates is explained to clarify debates on state net metering policies. The section provides an overview of how electricity rates are set, clarifying major areas of debate for state net metering policies. Ratemaking allocates total costs utilities incur in producing and delivering electricity, with complexities and local factors influencing the process. The discussion focuses on typical considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities that own and operate all parts of the electricity system in their service territory. This section discusses ratemaking considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities, where regulators approve rates for the utility to charge customers to recover costs of power plant operations, transmission, and compliance with regulations. Vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities recover costs through customers' bill payments, including power plant operations, grid maintenance, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. Rates are typically set based on volumetric rates. The setting of rates for utilities is based on meter data for billing, programmatic costs, and return on investments. Volumetric rates are commonly used, where all customers within a customer class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour. Customers' bills vary based on their electricity consumption, with regulators estimating rates to recover total costs. Customers' bills vary each month based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate rates to recover total costs, including generation, transmission, and distribution expenses. Customer charges for services like billing are separate from electricity rates and appear as fixed values on bills. Customer charges, such as billing services, are separate fixed values on bills and are additional to electricity rates. Some customer classes, like large industrial facilities, may have special system modifications and may incur demand charges for high electricity consumption. Large industrial facilities or institutions consume a lot of electricity, leading utilities to make special system modifications. Utilities may recover costs through demand charges paid only by high-consuming customers, in addition to volumetric charges. States with net metering have different compensation approaches, impacting DG markets. States with net metering have varied approaches in compensating customers, which can impact DG markets. Recent revisions in compensation mechanisms have been observed to influence the value proposition of DG investments for individual customers. One common approach is to compensate net metering customers at the utility's approved retail rate of electricity. The section discusses states' approaches to implementing net metering, where customers are compensated at the utility's retail rate of electricity. Initially, policymakers viewed this as a simple approach, acceptable when solar PV markets were uneconomic. Initially, policymakers viewed net metering as a simple approach using the retail rate as a proxy for rate setting, assuming it was acceptable when solar PV markets were uneconomic. The small number of participating customers and energy quantities credited at retail price meant any errors in estimating the true value would be minimal. The small number of participating customers and energy quantities credited at retail price meant any errors in estimating the true value would be minimal. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation as they reflect the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. Retail rates may encourage net metering participation more than other compensation methods. The retail rate for electric utility customers includes all costs for delivering electricity, encouraging net metering participation by allowing customers to recover DG system costs quickly. However, compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy in the ratemaking process. Compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may result in increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy in the ratemaking process. This arises from the fact that net metering customers generate their own electricity, reducing the utility's costs for providing electricity but not necessarily for other services like maintaining the grid. Self-generation, like solar net metering, may not reduce a customer's use of utility-provided services or the utility's costs for maintaining the grid. Rates for non-net metering customers could rise to cover grid maintenance costs not recovered from net metering customers. There are concerns about equity, as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes than non-net metering customers. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers, leading to cross-subsidy worries. Studies vary in their findings on the extent of cross-subsidies, with differences in methodologies used to estimate costs and benefits over different timeframes contributing to the lack of consensus on the issue. Some studies have shown disparities in cross-subsidies between residential net metering customers and non-net metering customers due to differences in methodologies used to estimate costs and benefits over varying timeframes. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. Estimates conducted around 2015 found net metering cost shifts ranging from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer annually. One synthesis of estimates conducted in or around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer per year. Observers may disagree on how much of a cross-subsidy is large enough to warrant policy action. Net metering, and any associated cross-subsidies, is only one factor affecting electricity rates. The 2017 study assessed rate effects of various factors on electricity prices, including net metering, energy efficiency, and state renewable portfolio standards. It found that DG would likely cause rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers, depending on participation rates and regulatory decisions. The possible presence of a cost shift in net metering does not imply a direct transfer of money from non-net metering customers. The extent of any shift would depend on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing cost shifts through ratemaking processes may be delayed due to inherent time lags. Cost shifts are not unique to distributed generation (DG) and are a common challenge in rate design. Some states are working to mitigate these effects within the larger context of rate design principles. Some states are exploring options to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies in net metering, such as adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for customers. States are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies. This allows utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance while maintaining some benefits for customers. Metering customers' bills allows utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance. This approach may benefit net metering customers by simplifying administration and promoting fairness. Proponents include utilities and advocates for low-income customers, while opponents include the solar industry and environmental advocates who argue that net metering fosters competition in the electricity industry. Opponents of net metering, such as the solar industry and environmental advocates, argue that fixed charges or other revisions that discourage distributed generation (DG) ignore the societal benefits that DG, especially solar energy, can provide. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial in practice. Some states have adopted alternative compensation rates to represent the energy costs utilities avoid. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate to represent the energy costs utilities avoid when net metering customers supply their own energy. The avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects the costs of producing energy. It may be estimated by a regulator or by referral to wholesale electricity markets and is usually lower than retail rates. This rate is used for net metering customers with installed solar PV. The cost rate for net metering customers with solar PV can be estimated using an independent methodology or by referral to wholesale electricity markets. Avoided cost rates are typically lower than retail rates. Another compensation rate, the value of solar (VOS) rate, considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. The value of solar (VOS) rate considers societal benefits such as reduced air emissions and is often higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates. Solar advocates advocate for including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. The VOS rate, higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, can be set by states based on perceived solar benefits. New York is one state implementing this approach for distributed energy resources. The rate can be applied in different net metering arrangements, sparking debates on alternative compensation approaches. The VOS rate, higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, can be set by states based on perceived solar benefits. It could be applied in various net metering arrangements, leading to debates on alternative compensation approaches. States vary in evaluating net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis conducted for the U.S. Department of Energy. \"Costs and benefits of net metering may change with DG penetration levels. A 2018 analysis for the U.S. DOE found that states differ in their evaluation methods, with varying assumptions impacting study results. State net metering policies also differ in compensation and other aspects.\" State net metering policies vary in compensation and other aspects, such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can impact the deployment of Distributed Generation (DG). Program caps set limits on the number of participants or generation capacity, expressed in units like megawatts or a percentage of electricity demand. Program caps, expressed in units like megawatts or a percentage of electricity demand, can affect the promotion of Distributed Generation (DG) under state net metering policies. They are established to reduce risks to the electricity system, prevent cross-subsidies, and minimize negative financial impacts for utilities. Program caps are set to reduce risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies. They can also impact achieving renewable energy goals. States specify which generation sources can participate in net metering, with solar energy being dominant but other types allowed as well. Net metering allows various generation sources to participate based on capacity limits and technology type. Solar energy is the primary source, but other energy types can also take part. Factors like cost, customer type, and location influence participation, with projects like combined heat and power facilities appealing to large commercial and industrial customers, and distributed wind projects being attractive to farms or customers with large acreage. Net metering customers, including those with combined heat and power facilities or distributed wind projects, can deliver surplus generation to the grid. State policies vary in compensating for total electricity generation or just surplus generation. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation for it. States have different policies for crediting surplus generation, which can help reduce total electricity costs for customers. Credit retention policies vary by state and can determine how much customers can reduce their electricity costs. Net metering can apply to single customers with a single generator or multiple customers with shared generation capacity. Shared net metering, including virtual net metering for onsite projects like multi-family dwellings, allows multiple customers to benefit from the same net metering generation capacity. Third party participation, such as solar leasing and power purchase agreements, involves ownership of the solar system by an entity other than the electricity consumer. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation addressing states' net metering policies, including limiting state regulators' ability to change compensation rates or add fixed charges to net metering customers' bills. Some legislation introduced in Congress aims to regulate state net metering policies, such as limiting state regulators' ability to adjust compensation rates or add fixed charges to customers' bills. Other bills propose requiring states to consider adopting net billing policies for community solar and conducting studies on the costs and benefits of net metering. In the 116th Congress, legislation such as S. 346 and H.R. 1009 would require studies on various aspects of net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed generation, planning techniques, and consumer incentives."
