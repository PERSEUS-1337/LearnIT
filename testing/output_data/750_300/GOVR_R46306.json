    "content": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications or licensure. Demand for such programs is expected to continue. There is a growing demand for non-degree programs like apprenticeships and certificate courses that lead to professional certifications. Jobs requiring postsecondary education but not a college degree are increasing, and the federal government provides over $100 billion in financial aid annually for individuals pursuing these programs. The federal government provides over $100 billion in financial aid annually for individuals pursuing postsecondary education, but most funds are not available for non-degree programs. Some traditional colleges are exploring creative approaches to increase enrollment, including targeting adults seeking short completion programs. Some traditional colleges are looking for new ways to boost enrollment by offering short completion programs for adults, aiming to increase workforce reentry and earnings. Congress may consider providing federal support for students pursuing postsecondary non-degree programs. Several proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students pursuing non-degree programs, including the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) which aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for short-term education programs. The House Committee on Education and Labor ordered reported the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) in October 2019, which would reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA) and expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers presented options to bring individuals back into the workforce with necessary skills, including providing unemployment benefits during training and developing a comprehensive retraining program. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs not currently eligible, supported by education and business organizations. Some stakeholders have concerns about promoting non-degree programs. Several education and business organizations support extending Pell Grants and Direct Loans to shorter programs, but some stakeholders are concerned about promoting non-degree programs. There are worries about the quality of these programs, their impact on employment and earnings, and the potential high federal costs associated with supporting them. Some concerns about extending Pell Grants and Direct Loans to non-degree programs include ensuring program quality, high federal costs, student supports, business coordination, and perpetuating income inequalities. Questions have been raised about diminishing labor market returns for some technical non-degree programs. Some non-degree educational programs may not be preferred by employers despite high quality. Employers are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring, making it harder for non-degree holders to secure employment long-term. Degree holders in non-degree required positions may also impact non-degree job opportunities. Non-degree credential holders may face challenges in securing long-term employment as employers increasingly prioritize degrees. Degree holders in positions not requiring a degree may also limit opportunities for non-degree holders. Federal programs support individuals in non-degree training and work-based learning programs. This report outlines federal programs supporting individuals in non-degree training and work-based learning programs, addressing employer demand for non-degree holders. The report discusses employer demand for individuals who have completed non-degree programs and outlines key characteristics of non-degree programs, including work-based learning. It also details six federal programs and three tax benefits that provide financial support to students in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs, highlighting potential gaps and limitations in support. The report discusses employer demand for individuals completing non-degree programs and federal programs providing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs, highlighting gaps and limitations in support. Key stimuli for promoting financial support include unfulfilled employer needs and economic growth. The report highlights the unfulfilled employer need for individuals with non-degree credentials, which is hindering economic growth. Data on employment proportions and wages by education requirements is provided, giving insight into the market for non-degree credentials. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy were in non-degree programs in May 2018. In May 2018, around 6.2% of national economy jobs required a non-degree postsecondary credential for entry-level positions. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns typical education requirements for occupations it tracks, along with mean annual wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns typical education requirements for occupations it tracks, along with mean annual wages. Mean annual wages for occupations that require a high school diploma, some college, or a non-degree credential are similar. However, there may be significant earnings differentials within these categories. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age. Research shows earnings premiums for various certificate programs, including long-term certificates, technical certificates, and those from community colleges. Wage differences within education categories are not fully captured by mean annual wages. Postsecondary non-degree programs provide training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age. These programs prepare individuals for specific occupations and can be classified as instructional or work-based learning. Postsecondary non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment, offering a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion. Non-degree instructional programs provide specialized job training and general employment preparation, awarding a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion. Individuals enroll in these programs to expand knowledge, skills, prepare for further education, employment, or promotion. These programs exclude postbaccalaureate pathways. Non-degree instructional programs are undertaken for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for employment, sustaining employment, or seeking promotion. These programs exclude postbaccalaureate certificates and transfer programs, which provide education for at least two academic years and are acceptable for full credit towards a bachelor's degree. Non-degree instructional programs should not be confused with certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials awarded by entities assessing individuals against established standards. Non-degree instructional programs are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials awarded by entities assessing individuals against established standards. Licenses are required for certain occupations, while certifications demonstrate competency. Various entities offer non-degree instructional programs, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions like colleges and universities. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities, including colleges, trade schools, businesses, and government organizations. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs. Other providers include professional organizations, museums, hospitals, and the military. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length and duration, with programs ranging from a few days to over two years. The length is determined by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and the skills the program aims to impart. Programs vary in length, ranging from a few days to over two years, depending on curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skill complexity. Program duration can be influenced by federal, state, and private entities, with some programs designed in stackable units for flexibility. Programs can be taken in classrooms or online. The overall program duration may be broken up if designed in stackable units, offered in various formats. Students must fund the program cost, which varies by length and provider. For heavily enrolled programs, the average cost for tuition and fees was over $9,000 in AY2018-2019. The cost of educational programs varies by length, resource requirements, and provider. In AY2018-2019, the average cost for tuition and fees was over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and approximately $15,000 at private less-than-two-year colleges. There is a distinction between credit and noncredit instructional programs, with courses in the same field offered for credit at one institution and noncredit at another. Credit courses and programs can be transferred for completion of other credit programs. Degree programs are all credit programs approved by accrediting entities with stringent requirements. Noncredit programs do not offer currency towards credit programs but may provide CEUs or vocational certificates. They are often cheaper and cover a wider range of topics. Noncredit programs are less expensive, cover a broader range of topics, and can be quickly modified to meet industry and student needs. They may satisfy career entry requirements, offer ABE and ESL instruction, provide personal enrichment, and offer customized training. About 38% of enrollments in one state community college system from 2007-2013 were in noncredit programs. Approximately 38% of enrollments in one state community college system from 2007-2013 were in noncredit courses, including vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED. National data on non-degree instructional programs are incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 not enrolled in high school had a postsecondary certificate. The 2016 nationwide survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 not enrolled in high school had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning includes a variety of training and educational activities. In AY2017-2018, Title IV Federal Student Aid awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and around 3 million undergraduate degrees. Work-based learning encompasses various training activities to develop workplace skills, occurring at different career stages and in different forms. Examples of work-based learning in the federal context include on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. These programs provide opportunities for career exploration and specialized technical training for workers at different stages of their careers. Earn and learn programs offer wages or remuneration, while RA programs have DOL oversight. RA programs are a form of work-based learning with DOL oversight, registered with DOL or a DOL-approved state agency. Registration requirements include a work process schedule outlining competencies and how OJT and/or related instruction will lead to proficiency. The application for work-based learning programs must include a work process schedule outlining competencies and training methods. Programs must be reviewed every five years to ensure compliance, and may be deregistered for persistent failure. Multiple entities can offer work-based learning experiences. Work-based learning encompasses a broad range of training activities and can be offered by various entities such as employers, labor unions, training providers, and educational institutions. These experiences are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee, with programs subject to review every five years and potential deregistration for persistent failure. Work-based learning is structured to meet the needs of employers, potential employers, or trainees. RA programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training, typically lasting four years. Some programs use a time-based approach for skill acquisition. RA programs typically last four years and require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training. They can take a time-based or competency-based approach, or a combination of both. Related instruction is also included in the program design. The costs of work-based learning programs are mainly covered by the provider, with the possibility of trainees having to contribute. Work-based learning programs are constructed as hybrid programs combining time-based and competency-based approaches. Program costs include lost work time, fees for trainers, and trainee wages. Trainees may need to cover living costs and related instruction expenses. Some costs may be offset by increased productivity. Trainees may also be required to pay for certain costs. Some work-based learning programs may require trainees to pay for related instruction or other costs. Trainees who do not receive remuneration must cover their own transportation, room, and board, potentially forgoing wages from other employment. Data on work-based training are limited and vary in methodology and purpose. Data on work-based or employer provided training are limited and vary in methodology. Surveys show that while most establishments offer some training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranges from 16% to 70%. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 had completed a work-based learning program. Most establishments offer training, with 16% to 70% of workers receiving it. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with 81,000 completing a program, mainly in the construction industry. In FY2019, the Department of Labor reported approximately 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. The federal government provides financial support for training and education to help individuals enter the workforce and reach their potential, but none of the programs focus solely on non-degree programs. The federal government provides support for training and education to help individuals enter the workforce and realize their potential. Federal programs do not exclusively focus on promoting training or education through non-degree programs. The design and implementation of these programs vary, including the choice and monitoring of non-degree programs. The primary benefit programs are aimed at supporting the pursuit of training or education. The federal government offers support for training and education through various programs such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, subsidizes training costs for individuals pursuing education and training. Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, encourages workforce development by subsidizing training costs. Title IV of the Higher Education Act provides grants and loans to students for postsecondary education. The Internal Revenue Code offers tax benefits for post-education financial support. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers educational assistance for veterans. The IRS administers tax benefits for post-education financial support. The VA offers educational assistance programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC. Other programs provide training and education assistance for needy families. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment & Training (E&T) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provide training and education opportunities for individuals at risk of educational failure and support needy families with education assistance. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), offers flexibility for states to use funds for workforce training and education to support students in non-degree programs. Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is a key federal workforce program highlighted in the report. Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the primary federal workforce development legislation aimed at increasing coordination among federal programs. WIOA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and funded through discretionary appropriations to improve employment outcomes and postsecondary credential attainment for participants. Title I of WIOA, administered by DOL, aims to increase employment, earnings, and postsecondary credential attainment. It also seeks to improve workforce quality, reduce welfare dependency, and meet employer skill needs through formula grants to states for Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities. The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program under WIOA Title I provides formula grants to states for workforce development. Funds are allocated to local Workforce Development Boards for establishing One-Stop delivery systems, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. Participants have consumer choice in accessing career services. The WIOA program offers consumer choice to participants, with career services categorized as basic and individualized. Basic services include labor market information and job postings, while individualized services include skills assessment and case management. Eligible participants can pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider of their choice listed on the state's ETPL. The WIOA program offers consumer choice to participants, with basic services like labor market information and job postings, and individualized services such as skills assessment and case management. Eligible participants can pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider listed on the state's ETPL. Entities eligible for HEA Title IV federal student aid programs must offer recognized postsecondary credential programs or provide RA. WIOA Title I funds can support non-degree and degree instructional programs, work-based learning like OJT and customized training for occupations in demand locally or regionally. Training must also have high potential for sustained demand or growth as determined by the local WDB. Training provided by entities eligible for HEA Title IV federal student aid programs must be for occupations in demand locally or regionally, or with high growth potential as determined by the local WDB. The training should lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, employment, or measurable skill gains. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows for various forms of training and education, including industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, employment, or measurable skill gains. Local areas can allocate funds for incumbent worker training. WIOA provides universal access to career services for adults age 18 and older, regardless of qualifying characteristics. Under WIOA, adults age 18 and older in the United States have universal access to career services without needing to meet specific criteria. Individualized career services are provided to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Training eligibility is based on the need to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency. To be eligible for training under WIOA, an individual must be in need of training services to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, have the necessary skills and qualifications, select a training service linked to a local occupation, and be unable to receive other grant assistance. These determinations are made by a One-Stop operator through an interview, evaluation, or assessment. To access training services under WIOA, individuals must demonstrate a need for training to secure or maintain employment for economic self-sufficiency. They must also lack other grant assistance and select a training service related to a local occupation. One-Stop operators assess and evaluate individuals to determine eligibility for training services. Priority for career and training services is given from funds allocated for adult employment and training activities. Under WIOA, One-Stop operators assess individuals for training services and prioritize recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies for career and training services. Local Workforce Development Boards, in consultation with the state's governor, determine fund allocation among these groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services. Under WIOA, local WDB, in consultation with the governor, allocate funds among priority groups for training services. ITAs or contracts can be used for training, with funds also available for supportive services and needs-related payments. Individuals eligible for training services can choose from the ETPL with the One-Stop operator, establishing an ITA for payment. Under WIOA, individuals eligible for training services can choose from the ETPL with the One-Stop operator to establish an ITA for payment to the ETP. Local WDBs have the authority to set limits on the type, duration, and amount of an ITA for training services. ITA funds can be used for non-degree instructional and degree programs, as well as the related instruction portion of an RA. Limits on ITA amounts can be based on individual circumstances or set across-the-board. WIOA participants can use ITA funds for non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction in RA. Local WDBs can also provide supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments for training participation. Training can be done through ITA or a contract for services with work-based learning. An individual can participate in training through the ITA model or a contract for services provided by local WDBs. The contract is an agreement between the WDB and an employer or RA sponsor for occupational training in exchange for reimbursement. This option is used when consumer choice requirements are met, and services include OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment. It is chosen when there are insufficient training providers in the local area to meet ITA requirements. The local WDB may contract training services for individuals in in-demand occupations or industry sectors, meeting specific requirements such as OJT, RA, customized training, or transitional employment. This option is chosen when there are not enough training providers in the area to meet ITA requirements or when a local training program is proven effective for individuals with barriers to employment. The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) can contract training services for individuals in in-demand occupations or industry sectors, such as On-the-Job Training (OJT) or Registered Apprenticeship (RA). Reimbursement rates for wages can be up to 50% for OJT and up to 75% for RA sponsors. States are responsible for developing the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), while local WDBs and One-Stop operators administer training programs and payments to providers. The sponsors can cover up to 75% of an apprentice's wages through a contract, not an ITA. States develop the ETPL, and local WDBs and One-Stop operators manage training programs and payments. Administrative structures vary by state, with quality assurance for training providers ensured through eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB establish criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce investment areas, with RA programs automatically eligible for the state ETPL. The governor and state WDB establish criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce investment areas. RA programs are automatically eligible for the state ETPL, while non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing providers must follow procedures to maintain eligibility under WIOA. The governor and state WDB set criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce investment areas. Existing providers must follow procedures to maintain eligibility under WIOA, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors like the duration of OJT contracts and determining employer eligibility for WIOA funding. The length of OJT contracts is determined by the local WDB based on training content and prior work experience. WIOA requires consideration of individual characteristics and training relevance for employer eligibility without setting quantifiable targets. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs are exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit to the governor for continued eligibility. WIOA mandates ETPs and states to report program participation and outcomes, with RA programs exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years to the governor for continued eligibility, including data on program participants' employment status and earnings post-training. The governor may require performance information on program participants' employment status, earnings, postsecondary credentials, cost of attendance, and completion rates for continued eligibility. The governor may require performance information on program participants' credentials, cost of attendance, and completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with detailed data on training services received by participants. The ETP performance reports must include data on the total number of participants, exits from training services, average cost per participant, and number of participants with barriers to employment served by WIOA Title I programs. The ETP performance reports for WIOA Title I programs must include data on participants with barriers to employment, disaggregated by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Recent data shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in work-based learning, with the majority being age 30 and over. In 2017, there were 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in WIOA-authorized work-based learning. The majority were over 30 years old, unemployed, and lacked postsecondary education. 22% of adults and 34% of dislocated workers had a degree. In 2018, fewer than 20% of WIOA Title I participants engaged in work-based learning under contract. In 2018, WIOA Title I participants showed low engagement in work-based learning. Over 66% pursued skills training through non-degree programs with ITAs. Popular occupations for adults included healthcare, transportation, and production, while dislocated workers focused on transportation, computer, office support, and management. The most popular occupations pursued by dislocated workers under WIOA Title I were transportation and material moving, computer and mathematical, office and administrative support, and management. The program primarily provides career services for adult entry or reentry into the workforce, but also offers short-term training and education. Increasing focus on non-degree training and education access, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs could enhance support for participants. Increasing focus on non-degree training and education access, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and eliminating restrictions on recipients obtaining other grant assistance could enhance support for participants pursuing career services. The curr_chunk discusses the potential elimination of restrictions on recipients obtaining other grant assistance to allow programs to supplement each other. It also mentions the varying quality of non-degree programs due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Additionally, it touches on Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which provides financial assistance to students for higher education at certain institutions. Title IV aid programs, administered by the Department of Education, offer grants and loans to financially needy students for higher education at certain institutions. The main types of aid include Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans through the Direct Loan program, designed to provide portable aid to eligible postsecondary education institutions. The Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs provide portable aid to eligible postsecondary education institutions. Direct Loan program loans are available to all eligible individuals regardless of congressional appropriations, as it is a mandatory entitlement program. Other smaller aid programs authorized by Title IV are not discussed in this report. The Direct Loan program is a mandatory entitlement program for budgetary purposes, allowing all eligible individuals to borrow according to program rules. Pell Grants are considered a quasi-entitlement, providing eligible students with their entitled award regardless of discretionary appropriations levels. Both Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions, including non-degree instructional and degree programs. Title IV-eligible programs must meet various criteria for quality assurance. Participating institutions are classified as public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational institutions. Non-degree programs have specific eligibility requirements. Title IV-participating institutions are classified as public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational institutions. Non-degree programs must meet eligibility requirements, such as leading to a recognized non-degree credential. Title IV aid is generally not available for noncredit programs or programs without a defined number of credit or clock hours. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized non-degree credential. Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs or programs without a defined number of credit or clock hours. OJT in work-based learning programs must be supervised by an IHE, with less than 50% offered by an entity under contract. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements in terms of instructional time and credit or clock hours. Public and private nonprofit institutions offer non-degree programs eligible for Pell Grants. Non-degree programs offered by public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Pell Grants and Direct Loan programs. This includes a minimum of 15 weeks of instructional time and a certain number of clock hours or semester/quarter hours. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Pell Grants and Direct Loan programs. This includes a minimum of 10 weeks of instructional time and a certain number of clock hours or semester/quarter hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Students must be enrolled in an eligible program on at least a half-time basis to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions that are at least one academic year in length and lead to a certificate are eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans. To receive Title IV funds for higher education, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program and meet other criteria, including being a U.S. citizen. To receive Title IV funds for higher education, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program and meet criteria such as being a U.S. citizen, having a high school diploma or equivalent, and meeting program-specific eligibility requirements for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans. To receive Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans for higher education, students must meet program-specific eligibility criteria, including being enrolled in an undergraduate program, not having completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrating financial need. Recipients are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters for Pell Grants. The Pell Grant program has a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters for recipients from low-income families. To receive Direct Loan program loans, students must meet specific criteria and be enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be required for specific loan types, including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need. Individuals borrowing on behalf of a dependent child may need to meet additional eligibility criteria for specific Direct Loan program loan types. The primary loans include Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for any student, and PLUS Loans for parents of dependent undergraduates and graduate/professional students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of their academic program length. Eligibility for Title IV aid is determined based on specific guidelines. The amount of Title IV aid a student is eligible for is determined by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the cost of attendance (COA), which includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and sometimes room and board. The COA may also cover transportation costs. The cost of attendance (COA) is a measure of a student's educational expenses, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation costs, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant awards are determined without considering other financial assistance, with a maximum amount set by annual appropriations acts and the Higher Education Act (HEA). For the 2020-2021 academic year, the maximum Pell Grant award is established. For the 2020-2021 academic year, the maximum Pell Grant award amount is $6,345 for full-time students enrolled in a 26-30 week academic year. The award may be adjusted based on the student's cost of attendance, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grants used for non-degree programs may be subject to income taxation, while those used for degree programs are taxable only if not used for tuition and fees. Pell Grant awards for non-degree programs may be subject to income taxation, while awards for degree programs are taxable only if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors can affect aid amount. Other financial assistance received must be considered when awarding Direct Loan program loans. When awarding Direct Loan program loans, other financial assistance received by the student must be considered. The amount awarded cannot exceed annual and aggregate limits based on dependency status and class level. For example, a dependent undergraduate student may borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while an independent undergraduate student may borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with FSA handling high-level functions. Dependent undergraduates can borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. Loan amounts are prorated for programs shorter than a full academic year. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with FSA handling high-level functions such as contracting for system operations and providing customer service. IHEs are responsible for day-to-day tasks like awarding and disbursing aid to students, with funds provided by ED. IHEs are responsible for day-to-day tasks associated with awarding and disbursing Title IV aid to students, including verifying eligibility, calculating aid amounts, and managing program funds. ED provides funds to IHEs for this purpose and also pays an administrative cost allowance under the Pell Grant program. Various provisions under the Higher Education Act aim to ensure the quality of Title IV-eligible programs and protect students and taxpayers. The Pell Grant program provides administrative cost allowance to participating IHEs. Provisions under the Higher Education Act aim to ensure program quality and protect students and taxpayers through the program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. State authorization offers consumer protection, accreditation ensures quality assurance, and ED certification provides oversight of Title IV program compliance. State authorization, accreditation, and ED certification are part of the program integrity triad to ensure quality and compliance in Title IV programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. IHEs must be authorized within their state to participate in Title IV programs. The gainful employment requirements for Title IV-eligible programs vary among states. Some states approve individual educational programs, while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. State evaluations of educational programs may differ in criteria such as program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, and student outcomes. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as a reliable authority on program quality. State evaluations of educational programs vary in criteria such as curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, and student outcomes. Some states also require programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency. States require programmatic accreditation or separate approval by another state agency. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as a reliable authority on education quality. Accrediting agencies are private associations that review educational institutions and programs. An IHE needs regional or national accreditation to participate in Title IV programs, meeting accrediting agency criteria. Accreditation by a regional or national accreditor is necessary for an IHE to participate in Title IV programs. The accreditor evaluates various areas such as faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Accrediting agencies have discretion in determining evaluation measures. Accrediting agencies evaluate an IHE's performance on various criteria such as faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought to meet employer and licensure requirements. Educational programs are evaluated based on established standards for the specific field. To gain programmatic accreditation, an educational program offered by an IHE is evaluated on established standards for the particular field of study. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which evaluates if the institution meets eligibility requirements for the programs. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which evaluates if the institution meets eligibility requirements for the programs. This includes reviewing each educational program to ensure it satisfies eligibility requirements such as durational requirements and completion rates. IHEs can self-certify new programs or submit applications for approval. The Higher Education Act (HEA) allows institutions to self-certify new programs for Title IV eligibility or submit applications for approval. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, with regulations defining this term. The 2014 gainful employment regulations, which established debt-to-earnings rates for program quality, were rescinded in 2019. The 2014 gainful employment regulations defined gainful employment in a recognized occupation and established debt-to-earnings rates for program quality. Programs failing to meet minimum standards may become ineligible for Title IV participation for three years. Under the gainful employment framework, programs must meet debt-to-earnings rates and third-party standards to maintain Title IV eligibility. No program has lost eligibility yet.

Some students may not be eligible, such as those without a high school diploma, students with a bachelor's degree for Pell Grants, and students enrolled less than half-time for Direct Loans. Quality of non-degree programs is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad. The quality of non-degree programs at Title IV-participating IHEs is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad. State authorizers and accreditors have flexibility in determining quality criteria, but variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessment. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements and their impact on program quality. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements and their impact on program quality. Variation among state authorization requirements is seen as an impediment in assessing institutional experiences. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements, such as oversight issues, input requirements hindering innovative education models, and elongated timeframes for state authorization. Some challenges in state authorization for institutions include input requirements hindering innovation, elongated timeframes for approval, conflicts across state laws, and limited use of student outcomes in renewal decisions. Many states require institutions to report on student outcomes, but few base authorization renewal decisions on those outcomes. A 2014 GAO report highlighted strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation system, such as tailored peer reviews by institutional accreditors and programmatic accreditation aligned with specific fields. Weaknesses include conflicting interests, lack of resources, and difficulty assessing innovative education methods. The GAO identified weaknesses in the accreditation system, including conflicting interests, lack of resources, and challenges in assessing innovative education methods. Education tax benefits offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, primarily benefiting upper middle-income individuals.

Survey data analyzed by GAO shows that few families have these accounts, with those who do having higher assets and income. Research on education tax benefits suggests they have little impact on increasing enrollment, which may apply to non-degree programs as well. Research on education tax benefits has shown limited impact on enrollment. Limitations include delayed assistance for upfront costs, confusion over eligibility, and benefits only for taxpayers with income tax liabilities. Veterans education programs (GI Bills) were originally intended to help former servicemembers adjust to civilian life by providing for the \"reintegration of the discharged soldier, sailor, and marine into the civilian economy in the most prompt and adequate manner.\" The benefits have been renewed and revised over the years to also compensate for compulsory service and encourage reintegration. The Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) and GI Bills provide financial assistance to veterans for training and employment, aiming to prevent veteran unemployment and promote military retention. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, while the GI Bills compensate for compulsory service and encourage reintegration into civilian life. Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) and its predecessor incentivize training providers for program completion and employment. VET TEC is not a GI Bill but provides financial assistance to students enrolled in approved education programs, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. VET TEC is funded separately from GI Bills. The GI Bills and VET TEC are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. GI Bills are funded with mandatory spending, while VET TEC is funded by a limited allocation from GI Bill appropriations. The Post-9/11 GI Bill represents the majority of GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013, supporting education and training programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill represents approximately 80% or more of total GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013.

SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits to low-income households for eligible foods at authorized retailers. The majority of federal funding for SNAP goes towards food benefits, with additional funding provided by the federal government for other purposes. The SNAP program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, offers benefits to low-income households for purchasing eligible foods at authorized retailers. In addition to food benefits, federal funding also supports SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) programs to provide employment and education services for participants. Established in 1987, SNAP E&T aims to help household members gain skills and training to enhance their employment opportunities. The SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) program, established in 1987, aims to assist SNAP participants in gaining skills and training to increase their employability. States have the option to make their SNAP E&T programs mandatory or voluntary. Nondisabled adults ages 18 to 59 are subject to SNAP E&T program requirements. States can choose to make their E&T programs mandatory or voluntary. Most states operate voluntary E&T programs, offering job search programs, training, workfare, and work experience. USDA Food and Nutrition Service data shows that the majority of state agencies operate voluntary SNAP E&T programs, which include job search programs, training, workfare, work experience, education, self-employment training, and WIOA services. SNAP E&T funding includes mandatory funding of nearly $124 million without a state match, as well as federal match for administrative expenses, dependent care, and transportation. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS, in partnership with Seattle Jobs Initiative (SJI), has been operating SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project aimed at improving job retention. The project provides technical assistance and resources to states for more effective SNAP E&T programs. Total E&T funding varies yearly based on states' use of matching funds. SNAP to Skills is a project by USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative to enhance SNAP E&T programs in states. It provides technical assistance, tools, and resources to build more effective programs. Integration with WIOA Title I program is required, and delivery must be through the statewide workforce development system. The SNAP E&T program must be integrated with the WIOA Title I program and delivered through the statewide workforce development system. SNAP E&T recipients can access services through WIOA One-Stop centers, but SNAP staff are better equipped to address their unique challenges. States offer varying services and programs, with SNAP E&T programs providing education activities to improve basic skills. The SNAP E&T program offers education activities to improve basic skills, such as high school programs, remedial education, and English as a second language instruction. Services and programs vary by state. The SNAP E&T program offers education activities like high school programs, remedial education, and English as a second language instruction to enhance employability. Some states fund non-degree programs for SNAP participants pursuing education and training. SNAP E&T education activities must have a direct link to employment and help participants move promptly into employment. Common activities include vocational training, basic education, work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships. States may target services to specific populations. Participants must meet income eligibility requirements to participate in SNAP. SNAP E&T allows for employment and unpaid internships. Participants must meet income eligibility requirements, including gross and net monthly income thresholds. Some states may set the threshold as high as 200% of the federal poverty level.

The SNAP program requires non-disabled adults to register for work and maintain at least 30 hours per week. States have the option to set income eligibility requirements at up to 200% of the federal poverty level. The process for assigning individuals to SNAP E&T programs varies, with USDA guidance recommending assessment tools to determine the most effective components for participants. States may choose to make E&T mandatory for the eligible population or a subset of it. The 2018 farm bill now requires all states to provide case management services for participants in E&T programs, including intake assessments, service plans, and progress monitoring. E&T funds cannot be used for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families recipients. Some individuals may be enrolled in E&T programs half-time or more. SNAP E&T funds cannot be used for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families recipients. Some individuals enrolled half-time or more in an IHE may be ineligible for SNAP but eligible if placed through specified programs like WIOA Title I or SNAP E&T. SNAP E&T covers educational program costs and associated expenses. SNAP E&T funds cover educational program costs, including dependent care and transportation. Funding is administered by state agencies and contracted programs, often through third-party partnerships recommended by USDA-FNS. USDA-FNS recommends third-party partnerships for SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. Partners contribute financially or in-kind, and states reimburse them with federal funds. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant as the primary source of college expenses. The federal funds for SNAP E&T programs may cover 100% or require a 50% match. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant first for college expenses. E&T funds can cover remaining expenses, but must be reasonable and necessary. Before using E&T funds for tuition, other funding sources like education grants should be explored. Workforce partnerships were added to the E&T program by the 2018 farm bill. The state must explore other funding sources before using E&T funds for tuition. Workforce partnerships, including private employers and nonprofit organizations, provide training and work experience in the SNAP E&T program. Each state designs its program within federal rules and regulations. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules and regulations, with components such as OJT and apprenticeships. Programs must be approved by USDA-FNS and implemented in consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. State programs vary in capacity and services offered. SNAP E&T participants are informed about available programs through the SNAP state agency or partner agencies. States monitor program quality, with USDA-FNS providing assistance. The 2014 farm bill mandated USDA to establish performance indicators reporting, with regulations now finalized. USDA-FNS has provided technical assistance and resources to help SNAP E&T participants. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish performance indicators reporting, with the first annual report due in January 2018. However, as of the date of this report, USDA has not published any information based on the reports. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after completion of participation in SNAP E&T. The majority of SNAP E&T participants received services other than education. In FY2016, 38 state agencies included an education component in their E&T program, serving almost 70,000 participants. National reporting measures for SNAP E&T include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after program completion. In FY2016, 38 out of 53 SNAP state agencies offered an education component in their E&T program, serving around 70,000 participants. However, less than 10% of SNAP E&T participants actually receive education, with most opting for job search or other non-education components. In FY2016, 38 out of 53 SNAP state agencies offered an education component in their E&T program, serving around 70,000 participants. However, less than 10% of participants receive education, with most opting for job search or other non-education components. Information on the quality of educational programs or work experience is lacking, and future guidance may come from an evaluation on the 2014 farm bill pilot projects. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially reducing eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially affecting eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant aims to support needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF is administered by HHS and provides monthly assistance to needy families, primarily headed by single mothers. TANF is a block grant that allows states to spend funds on various benefits and services, including monthly assistance for needy families with children. Funds can also support subsidized employment, training programs, and career pathways. TANF funds can be used for subsidized employment, OJT, training, and education programs, including career pathways that offer support services for students and workers to advance in their chosen careers. Some states use TANF funds to pay coordinators at community colleges to recruit students and provide support services. One state program uses TANF funds to pay coordinators at community colleges to recruit students and provide support services, including college work-study jobs. TANF funds can be used for various training and education programs for low-income families with children. TANF funds can be used for vocational educational training for low-income families with children, with eligibility determined by the state. Financial eligibility rules vary among states. In 2015, a significant portion of adult TANF recipients had low levels of education. According to HHS data, in 2015, a significant number of adult TANF recipients had low levels of education. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, with states determining eligibility rules and benefit amounts. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 created TANF, requiring funds to be spent as determined by state legislatures. States also decide what activities to require of adult recipients. The Reconciliation Act of 1996 created TANF, giving states control over eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and required activities for adult recipients. Benefits can be reduced or ended if recipients refuse to participate in required activities, such as training and education. States may waive sanctions for valid reasons. TANF also provides funding for various programs. TANF provides funding for benefits and support services, including advising, career planning, and employment services, which are delivered at the state and local level. States determine which participants receive these services. TANF funds support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services at the state and local level. States decide which participants receive these services, and some may refer assistance recipients to a WIOA One Stop Center for education or employment. States can choose to operate employment and training services for TANF recipients separately from the WIOA system. There are no federal rules on the quality of training and education programs, but states may establish their own. The minimum work participation rate (WPR) is TANF's main performance measure, with each state required to meet a performance standard. The TANF program requires states to meet a performance standard based on work participation rates. States can establish rules for training and education programs, with limitations on what counts as engagement, such as a 12-month limit on vocational education training. States may also refer assistance recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment services. States may use TANF funds to assist single mothers with young children in vocational education training, with a 12-month limit. Data on TANF participation in training and education outcomes is limited. Child care and educational preparation may hinder TANF recipients from succeeding in non-degree programs. The TANF cash assistance caseload is significantly disadvantaged in terms of education, limiting their access to non-degree programs due to child care and educational barriers. The 12-month lifetime limit on vocational educational training further restricts the types of training TANF recipients can pursue, potentially hindering their success. The 12-month lifetime limit on vocational educational training may restrict the types of training TANF recipients can pursue, potentially hindering their success. Individual in apprenticeship program may exceed income eligibility threshold for assistance. Quality of training and education programs is unknown."
