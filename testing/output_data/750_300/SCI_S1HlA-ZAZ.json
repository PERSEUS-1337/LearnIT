It features a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism and is analytically tractable for optimal online compression. Formulated as a hierarchical conditional generative model, the memory enhances generative models trained on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Our memory model combines top-down memory and bottom-up perception to produce a code representing an observation. It significantly improves generative models trained on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets, with greater capacity and ease of training compared to DNC and its variants. Recent work in machine learning explores novel ways to augment neural networks with memory, but the efficient use of memory remains an open question. Recent research in machine learning has focused on enhancing neural networks with fast memory stores. The challenge of efficiently utilizing memory remains unresolved. Models like Differentiable Neural Computers collapse reading and writing into single slots, limiting information sharing across memory slots. Matching Networks and Neural Episodic Controller store embeddings of data directly. The challenge of efficiently utilizing memory in neural networks remains unresolved. Different models like Matching Networks and Neural Episodic Controller store embeddings of data directly, leading to an increase in memory volume with the number of samples stored. In contrast, the Neural Statistician summarizes datasets by averaging their embeddings, resulting in small \"statistics\" but potentially dropping a large amount of information. Historically developed associative memory architectures offer insights into designing efficient memory structures that store data in overlapping representations. For example, the Hopfield Net pioneered storing patterns in low-energy states, while the Boltzmann Machine lifts this concept. The capacity of these models is limited by the number of recurrent connections and the dimensionality of input patterns. BID14 introduced storing patterns in low-energy states in a dynamic system, limited by recurrent connections and input pattern dimensionality. The Boltzmann Machine BID1 overcomes this with latent variables but requires slow reading and writing. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model BID15 resolves this issue with fast reads and writes and dissociates capacity from input dimensionality. In this paper, a conditional generative memory model inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory is presented. The model is enhanced with learnable addresses and reparametrised latent variables. A Bayesian memory update rule is derived to effectively balance preserving old content and learning new information. The hierarchical generative model presented in this paper utilizes reparametrised latent variables and a Bayesian memory update rule to balance preserving old content and storing new content effectively. The model adapts quickly to new data, providing top-down knowledge in addition to bottom-up perception, enriching priors in VAE-like models through an adaptive memory system. Our proposal introduces a memory system for VAE models, enhancing priors with adaptive memory and enabling effective compression and storage of complex data. The memory architecture extends the VAE by deriving the prior from an adaptive memory store, improving the model's ability to learn online distributed writing. The VAE model is extended with an adaptive memory store for improved learning and data compression. The model includes observable and latent variables, with parameterised distributions implemented as multivariate Gaussian distributions. The prior is derived from the adaptive memory store, enhancing the model's ability to learn online distributed writing. The VAE model's parameters are represented by \u03b8 and \u03c6, implemented as multivariate Gaussian distributions. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood by optimizing \u03b8 and \u03c6 for a variational lower-bound of the likelihood. The first term is the negative reconstruction loss for reconstructing x. The VAE model optimizes \u03b8 and \u03c6 for a variational lower-bound of the likelihood. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood by reconstructing x and encouraging the approximated posterior to be near the prior of z. The model uses the concept of an exchangeable episode for training. In our model, we use the concept of an exchangeable episode for training generative models. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood by reconstructing x and encouraging the approximated posterior to be near the prior of z. The joint distribution is factorized into the marginal distribution of X and the posterior of M given X. This allows for computing p(M |X) as writing X into memory, providing a principled way of formulating memory-based generative models. The proposed scenario involves formulating memory-based generative models by maximizing the mutual information between the memory and the episode to store. The latent variables corresponding to the observed episode are denoted as Y and Z. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized accordingly. The generative model involves maximizing mutual information between memory and the episode. Latent variables Y and Z represent the observed episode. The joint distribution is factorized, with memory M as a random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution. The generative model maximizes mutual information between memory and the episode. Memory M is a K \u00d7 C random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution BID11, where R is the mean of M, U provides covariance between rows, and V provides covariances between columns. Independence is assumed between columns, with V fixed as the identity matrix and full freedom for U. Covariance between rows is found useful for coordinating memory access. The memory matrix M is a K \u00d7 C random matrix with covariance between rows provided by U and between columns by V. Independence is assumed between columns, with V fixed as the identity matrix and full freedom for U. The addresses A are a K \u00d7 S real-value matrix optimized through back-propagation, with rows normalized to have L2-norms of 1. The addressing variable y t computes weights controlling memory access, following an isotropic Gaussian distribution N(0, 1) for the prior p \u03b8 (y t). To avoid degeneracy, rows of A are normalized to have L2-norms of 1. The addressing variable y t computes weights controlling memory access, with a prior distribution of N(0, 1). A learned projection transforms y t into a key vector, and weights across the rows of M are computed using a multi-layer perception (MLP) projection. The code z t generates samples of x t through a conditional distribution. The code z t is a learned representation that generates samples of x t through a conditional distribution. The prior for z t is memory-dependent, resulting in a richer marginal distribution due to its dependence on memory and the addressing variable. In a hierarchical model, the global latent variable M captures statistics of an entire episode, while local latent variables y t and z t capture local statistics for data x t within the episode. To generate an episode of length T, M is sampled once, followed by sequential sampling of y t, z t, and x t. The approximated posterior distribution is factorized in the reading inference model. The reading inference model approximates the posterior distribution by factorizing it using conditional independence. The posterior distribution refines the prior distribution with additional evidence from x t. The constant variance of the prior distribution is omitted. The parameterised posterior distribution q \u03c6 (z t |x t , y t , M ) refines the prior distribution with evidence from x t, balancing the trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information optimally through Bayes' rule. Memory writing is interpreted as inference in the generative model perspective. Memory writing involves balancing the trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information optimally through Bayes' rule. It is interpreted as inference in the generative model perspective, considering both batch and online inference methods. The approximated posterior distribution of memory is computed using one sample to approximate the intractable integral. The posterior of the addressing variable remains the same as in previous sections. The approximated posterior distribution of memory is computed using one sample to approximate the intractable integral. The posterior of the addressing variable and code is parameterized. Notation is abused by using matrices for observations and weights. The posterior of memory is determined based on the linear Gaussian model. The posterior distribution of memory is analytically tractable in the linear Gaussian model. Parameters R and U are updated using Bayes' rule, with matrices representing observations and weights. The update rule for the prior parameters of memory in the linear Gaussian model involves matrices \u03a3c, \u03a3\u03be, and \u03a3z. The prior parameters are trained through back-propagation to learn the general structure of the dataset, while the posterior adapts to features in the observed data. The main cost of the update rule is inverting \u03a3z with a complexity of O(T^3), which can be reduced for lower per-step cost. The update rule for the prior parameters in the linear Gaussian model involves inverting \u03a3z with a complexity of O(T^3). This cost can be reduced by performing online updating using one sample at a time. Updating using the entire episode at once is equivalent to performing the one-sample update iteratively for all observations in the episode. Additionally, intermediate updates can be done using mini-batches with a size between 1 and T. The update rule involves inverting \u03a3z with a complexity of O(T^3). Updating using the entire episode at once is equivalent to performing one-sample update iteratively. Intermediate updates can be done using mini-batches with a size between 1 and T. The storage and multiplication of the memory's row-covariance matrix U has a complexity of O(K^2), but reducing this to diagonal can lower the cost to O(K). To optimize the model, a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood is used. Sampling from q\u03c6(yt, zt|xt, M) approximates the inner expectation. Mean-field approximation is employed for memory efficiency. Future work includes investigating low-rank approximation of U for better cost-performance balance. To maximize the lower bound, sampling is done from q\u03c6(yt, zt|xt, M) to approximate the inner expectation. Mean-field approximation is used for memory efficiency, with the first term inside the bracket representing the VAE reconstruction error and the first KL-divergence penalizing complex addresses. The Gaussian distribution is used for distribution-based reading and writing operations in VAE. The memory learns useful representations without relying on complex addresses, and iterative sampling is employed for reading mechanisms. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory utilizes iterative reading to decrease errors and converge to stored memories. This iterative process improves denoising and sampling in the model. The iterative process in the model involves repeatedly feeding back the reconstruction, which improves denoising and sampling. Using knowledge about memory in reading suggests using a parameterised model with the whole matrix M as input, which can be costly. However, intractable posteriors can be efficiently approximated in non-tree graphs. Training a parameterised model with the whole matrix M as input can be costly, but intractable posteriors in non-tree graphs can be efficiently approximated using loopy belief-propagation. Iterative reading works in the model due to the local coupling between x t and y t, leading to convergence to the true posterior q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ). Future research will focus on understanding this process further. The model implements local coupling between x t and y t effectively, allowing iterative sampling to converge to the true posterior q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ). The model architecture remains consistent across experiments, with variations in filter numbers, memory size, and code size. The Adam optimizer is used for training. Further research will aim to enhance understanding of this process. The model architecture remains consistent across experiments, with variations in filter numbers, memory size, and code size. The Adam optimizer is used for training, with minimal tuning required for model BID16. Experiments report the variational lower bound divided by the length of episode for comparison with existing models. Omniglot dataset was initially used for testing, containing images of hand-written characters with 1623 different classes and 20 examples in each class. The Omniglot dataset was used to test the model, which has images of hand-written characters with 1623 classes and 20 examples each. A 64 \u00d7 100 memory M and a smaller 64 \u00d7 50 address matrix A were used. 32 images are randomly sampled to form an \"episode\" without class labels, representing a worst-case scenario for compression. For simplicity, 32 images are randomly sampled from the training set to create an \"episode\" without class labels. The model is optimized using Adam with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. The CIFAR dataset is also tested, using convolutional coders with 32 features to handle the increased complexity of the images.

The code size is 200, with a 128 \u00d7 200 memory and a 128 \u00d7 50 address matrix. Training process is compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder. The training process of the model is compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder on the Omniglot dataset. The Kanerva Machine has only a modest increase in parameters compared to the VAE. Learning curves show a dip in the KL-divergence, indicating that the model has learned to use memory. The Kanerva Machine model achieved better reconstruction and KL-divergence compared to the VAE model trained on the Omniglot dataset. The KL-divergence of the Kanerva Machine sharply decreases around the 2000th step, indicating that the model learned to utilize memory effectively. The Kanerva Machine model outperformed the VAE in terms of reconstruction and KL-divergence. The model learned to use memory effectively, resulting in a rich prior for the code. This comes at the cost of additional KL-divergence for y t, which is still lower than the VAE. Training curves for CIFAR show similar trends. The VAE achieved a negative log-likelihood of \u2264 112.7 at the end of training, showing a reduction in KL-divergence which improved sample quality. The VAE reached a negative log-likelihood of \u2264 112.7 at the end of training, showing improvement in sample quality. The results are not directly comparable to unconditional generative models due to the advantage of its memory contents. The Kanerva Machine achieved a conditional NLL of 68.3, showcasing the power of incorporating an adaptive memory into generative models. The weights were well distributed over the memory, demonstrating patterns written into the memory were superimposed on others. The weights in the memory were well distributed, showing patterns were superimposed. Reconstruction of inputs and weights used in reconstruction were widely distributed across memory slots. Denoising through iterative reading was demonstrated. The model can generate \"one-shot\" from a single image or a batch of images. The text discusses the generalization of \"one-shot\" generation from a single image or a few sample images to a batch of images with many classes and samples. It compares samples from a VAE and a Kanerva Machine, showing improvement in sample quality over iterations. The text compares samples from a VAE and a Kanerva Machine, showing improved sample quality over iterations with samples from 2, 4, or 12 classes. The iterative sampling converged after the 6th iteration, reflecting the conditioning patterns' statistics. This approach does not apply to VAEs due to their lack of structure discussed in section 3.5. The comparison of samples from CIFAR dataset shows that VAEs do not improve sample quality over iterations like the Kanerva Machine does. Samples from VAEs lack meaningful local structure, while Kanerva Machine samples have clear local structures. The 24 conditioning images from the CIFAR dataset show that samples from the VAE are blurred and lack local structure, while the Kanerva Machine samples have clear local structures. The model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, even though it was not trained for this task. Our model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, showing clear local structures. Despite some cases producing incorrect patterns due to high ambiguity, the model's structure allows for interpretability of internal representations in memory. The model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, showing clear local structures. Representations of data x are obtained from a linear combination of memory slots, allowing for interpretability of internal representations in memory. Interpolating between address weights produces meaningful and smoothly changing images. The training curves of DNC and Kanerva machine show differences in sensitivity to initialization, speed, and error plateauing. Test variational lower-bounds of DNC and Kanerva Machine are compared based on episode sizes and sample classes. The model is compared with DNC and a variant, LRUA, using the same testing methods. The comparison between our model, the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), and a variant called LRUA is conducted using the same episode storage and retrieval task with Omniglot data. The DNC reached a test loss close to 100 but was sensitive to hyperparameters and random initialization. The LRUA did not pass the loss level of 150. The DNC and Kanerva Machine were compared in training processes. The DNC was sensitive to hyperparameters and random initialization, with only 2 out of 6 instances reaching a test loss close to 100. The Kanerva Machine, on the other hand, was robust to hyperparameters and performed well with various batch sizes and learning rates. The Kanerva Machine showed robustness to hyperparameters, performing well with batch sizes between 8 and 64 and learning rates between 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124. It trained fastest with a batch size of 16 and learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124, converging below 70 test loss with all configurations. This ease of training is attributed to principled reading and writing operations independent of model parameters. The model's capacity was compared to the DNC by analyzing the likelihood when storing and retrieving patterns from large episodes.

The model's capacity was compared to the DNC by analyzing the likelihood when storing and retrieving patterns from large episodes. The models were tested on episodes with varying numbers of classes, showing that both models could exploit redundancy effectively. The Kanerva Machine generalized well to larger episodes and maintained a clear advantage. The Kanerva Machine, a novel memory model combining slow-learning neural networks and a fast-adapting linear Gaussian model, generalizes well to larger episodes and outperforms the DNC in terms of variational lower-bound. The model removes the assumption of a uniform data distribution by training a generative model to learn the observed data distribution efficiently. Our architecture, inspired by Kanerva's model, utilizes neural networks and a fast-adapting linear Gaussian model as memory. By training a generative model to learn the observed data distribution, we can retrieve unseen patterns through sampling, consistent with constructive memory neuroscience experiments. Previous works have developed probabilistic interpretations of Kanerva's model. Our model generalizes Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data while incorporating Bayesian inference and integration with deep neural networks. Kanerva's memory model is extended to handle continuous, non-uniform data with Bayesian inference and integration with deep neural networks. Unlike other models, it quickly adapts to new data for episode-based learning. Our model quickly adapts to new data for episode-based learning by storing information in a compressed form, unlike BID5's model which uses raw pixels to populate memory, leading to high storage costs for large datasets. Our model efficiently stores information in a compressed form by leveraging statistical regularity in images through the encoder, learned addresses, and Bayes' rule for memory updates. It employs an exact Bayes' update-rule for memory updating without compromising neural network flexibility and expressive power. Our model combines classical statistical models with neural networks to efficiently update memory using an exact Bayes' update-rule. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory is reviewed for comparison, highlighting its distributed reading approach. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model features distributed reading and writing operations with fixed addresses A pointing to modifiable memory M. Inputs are uniform random vectors y \u2208 {\u22121, 1} D, with addresses A i randomly sampled to reflect input statistics. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model involves fixed addresses A pointing to modifiable memory M. Inputs are compared to addresses through Hamming distance, with selection based on a threshold \u03c4. The selection process is summarized by a binary weight vector. The sparse distributed memory model by Kanerva involves fixed addresses A pointing to modifiable memory M. Inputs are compared to addresses through Hamming distance, with selection based on a threshold \u03c4. The selection process is summarized by a binary weight vector. During writing, a pattern x is stored into M by adding M k \u2190 M k + w k x. For reading, the memory contents pointed to by selected addresses are summed together to produce a readout. This reading process can be iterated by repeatedly feeding back the output as input. When both K and D are large enough, a small portion of the addresses will always be selected, making the operations sparse. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model involves fixed addresses pointing to modifiable memory. The reading process can be iterated by feeding back the output as input. When K and D are large enough, a small portion of addresses will always be selected, ensuring sparse operations. Stored vectors can be retrieved correctly even if an address' content is overwritten multiple times. Kanerva also showed that a significantly corrupted query can still be discovered through iterative reading. However, the model's application is limited by the assumption of a uniform and binary data distribution. The application of Kanerva's model is restricted by the assumption of a uniform and binary data distribution, which is rarely true in practice. Real-world data typically lie on low-dimensional manifolds, making binary representation less efficient in high-level neural network implementations optimized for floating-point numbers. Our model architecture, as shown in FIG4, includes a convolutional encoder for converting input images into 2C embedding vectors for all experiments. The model architecture includes a convolutional encoder for converting input images into 2C embedding vectors, with 3 consecutive blocks and convolutional layers with 4x4 filters. The output is flattened and linearly processed. The model architecture includes a convolutional encoder with 4x4 filters and 3 blocks, followed by a ResNet block without bottleneck. The convolutional layers have 16 or 32 filters, and the output is linearly projected to a 2C dimensional vector. The convolutional decoder mirrors this structure with transposed convolutional layers. Adding noise to the input helps stabilize training. Adding noise to the input into q \u03c6 (y t |x t) helps stabilize training, possibly by restricting information in the addresses. Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.2 is used for all experiments. Different likelihood functions are used for Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Uniform noise is added to CIFAR images during training to prevent likelihood collapsing. The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for fair comparison. To prevent likelihood collapsing, uniform noise U(0, 1/256) is added to CIFAR images during training. The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for fair comparison, receiving addressing variable y_t and z_t during writing. During writing, the DNC receives z_t sampled from q \u03c6 (z t |x t) as input by concatenating y_t and z_t together into the memory controller. In experiments, the reading and writing stages were separated to prevent interference with DNC's external memory. A 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity was used as the controller instead of LSTM to avoid recurrent state interference. To avoid interference with DNC's external memory, a 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity is used as the controller instead of LSTM. Controllers bypassing memory output is prevented to ensure DNC only reads from memory, focusing on memory performance. The controller in the DNC is a 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity, avoiding interference with external memory. To focus on memory performance, the DNC only reads from memory, and the covariance between memory rows is crucial for test loss optimization. Models using full covariance matrices were slightly slower per-iteration but showed decreased test loss. The 8 models trained on machines with similar setups showed different performance using diagonal covariance matrices. The models using full covariance matrices were slightly slower per-iteration but had a faster decrease in test loss. The bottom-up stream in the model compensates for memory by directly sampling z t from p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ) for the decoder p \u03b8 (x t |z t ). During CIFAR training, the negative variational lower bound, reconstruction loss, and total KL-divergence were observed. During CIFAR training, the model reconstructs using read-outs from memory, with a small difference in KL-divergence influencing sample quality. The advantage of the Kanerva Machine over the VAE is increasing, as shown by the linear Gaussian model defined in Eq. 6.

The advantage of the Kanerva Machine over the VAE is increasing, as shown by the linear Gaussian model defined in Eq. 6. The joint distribution and posterior distribution are derived using conditional formulas for the Gaussian, with update rules provided in equations 9 to 11. The posterior distribution p(vec (M ) |vec (Z)) = N (vec (M ) ; \u00b5 p , \u03a3 p ) is derived using the Kronecker product property. An alternative approach is described that fully exploits the analytic tractability of the Gaussian distribution, using parameters \u03c8 = {R, U, V } for memory."
