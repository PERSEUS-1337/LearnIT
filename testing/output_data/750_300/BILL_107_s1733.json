The \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" mandates the development of a unified electronic data system by key government agencies to access relevant information for visa issuance and alien admissibility. The \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" requires a unified electronic data system for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to determine visa issuance and alien admissibility. The system must have name search capacity, linguistic sensitivity, and user support. The unified electronic data system for law enforcement and intelligence agencies must be searchable on a linguistically sensitive basis, provide user support, consult with private sector firms, utilize commercially available platforms, and be continuously improved based on experience and technological advancements. The unified electronic database for law enforcement and intelligence agencies must be continuously improved based on experience and technological advancements, with linguistically sensitive searches using algorithms accounting for variations in name formats and transliterations. Algorithms must be linguistically sensitive, accounting for variations in name formats and transliterations in multiple languages. Advanced research methods are incorporated for this purpose. Algorithms must be linguistically sensitive for at least 4 high-priority languages. The unified electronic data system should provide authoritative information on names in different languages, including gender. The unified electronic data system will provide authoritative information on names in different languages, including gender details, and a means for communication with experts.

Consultation is required between key officials and agencies in this process. The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, Director of Central Intelligence, and other key officials must consult with relevant agencies for the development of a data system. The system must adhere to a technology standard established by the USA PATRIOT Act. Access to information in the system is subject to certain conditions. The America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 outlines access to information in a data system for Foreign Service officers issuing visas and Federal agents determining alien admissibility. Procedures are established to restrict access to intelligence information.
