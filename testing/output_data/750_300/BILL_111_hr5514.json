The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to the States annually, including funds for health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. States receive money through various means such as grants, loans, and direct appropriations. States receive money from the Federal Government through various means like grants, loans, and direct appropriations. Every State spends money on common activities such as health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Some States are more effective than others in utilizing these funds. Taxpayers, legislators, and agencies should have access to objective performance data for comparison. States should be able to objectively compare performance data to identify the most effective use of taxpayer dollars, leading to competition and accountability. The Act aims to enhance government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings using total accountability measures, promoting efficiency in tax dollar usage and fostering competition among States. The Act requires annual state fiscal accounting reports to enhance government accountability and promote efficiency in tax dollar usage. Each State receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of the fiscal year. The report includes a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary for each entity. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget requires each State receiving Federal financial assistance to submit a State fiscal accounting report. This report must include a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, as well as a unit-cost summary for each entity. The Director is responsible for publishing these reports on an Internet website within 30 days of receiving them. SEC. 4. STANDARDIZATION OF STATE FISCAL ACCOUNTING REPORTS. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison. States must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Act requires State governments to submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days of enactment. The Director will establish a classification system for these programs based on relevant data, including information from the most recent census. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities based on relevant data, including information from the most recent census. For each agency activity, conduct will be identified as an \"activity unit\" that constitutes a completed instance of the activity. Performance measures will also be identified for each agency activity, to the extent practicable. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities based on relevant data. Each agency activity will have performance measures identified and linked electronically in reports. The unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government must be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. The statement of funds available for a budget entity must identify each source of funds and the amount, including State appropriations and Federal financial assistance. The budget entity must include State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other appropriate sources in the funds available for expenditure. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. Line item listings for agency activities must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. Relevant details about the activity should also be described. The agency activity line item listings must include the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, unit cost, conduct constituting an activity unit, purposes of the activity, and intended beneficiaries. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for certain agency activities. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for agency activities where no method of measuring accomplishment exists, requiring consistent allocation to similar activities with measurable methods. Total funds expended must include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. The unit-cost of an agency activity is determined using a specific formula, as directed by the Director. Total funds expended must include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. The formula for determining the unit-cost (UC) of an agency activity involves the variables m and q, as defined in subsection (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) respectively. This formula is used for the reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures. The reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures involves identifying adjusted expenditures and explaining any differences with the sum of all funds available. Adjusted expenditures are determined by the formula AE = EXP + PT + REV. The formula for adjusted expenditures includes the sum of all expenditures, pass-throughs, and reversions identified by the budget entity. Pass-throughs and reversions can be identified based on criteria set by the Director. The Director has the authority to withhold 10 percent of Federal financial assistance from a State government if they fail to file a timely fiscal accounting report. The Director can also establish rules necessary for implementing the Act. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, such as \"State government,\" \"budget entity,\" \"agency activity,\" and \"Federal financial assistance.\""
