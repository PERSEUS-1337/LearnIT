    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. ATRA also temporarily extended provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 through 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. A number of provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 were temporarily extended through 2013 under ATRA. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended provisions that expired at the end of 2013 through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 either made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014, known as \"tax extenders.\" Many of these provisions, such as the research tax credit, had been extended multiple times before being made permanent. In the 114th Congress, there was significant debate on tax extenders. The tax provisions known as \"tax extenders\" were extended multiple times before being made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Ultimately, all expired tax provisions were either temporarily extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. The tax extenders were either temporarily extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, some provisions are still set to expire at the end of 2016, sparking debate in the 114th Congress on whether they should be extended. This report provides an overview of tax extenders. More detailed information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. The PATH Act in the Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent various tax provisions, including the enhanced child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. It also included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Division P of the same Act contained tax-related provisions, including changes to high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage. The PATH Act in the Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent various tax provisions, including the enhanced child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. It also included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Division P of the same Act contained tax-related provisions, including changes to high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage. Additionally, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, retroactively through 2014, and proposed other legislation in the 113th Congress. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, retroactively through 2014. Other legislation in the 113th Congress proposed various extensions and permanent provisions related to tax reform. In the 113th and 114th Congress, legislation was introduced to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent, including the research and experimentation tax credit and increased expensing allowances for businesses. This included bills like the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). In the 114th Congress, legislation was passed to extend certain expired tax provisions under IRC Section 179, including the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015, State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015, America Gives More Act of 2015, and American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 would have extended temporary provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, covering the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, covering the 2015 and 2016 tax years. This included all temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 and one provision from 2013, commonly referred to as the \"tax extender\" package. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress for short periods of time. The number of provisions considered \"tax extenders\" has grown as new temporary provisions are routinely added. Congress may choose temporary tax provisions for various reasons. The number of provisions considered \"tax extenders\" has grown as new temporary provisions are routinely added to the package. Congress may enact temporary tax provisions for reasons such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or natural disasters, and for budgetary reasons. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation of effectiveness before extension. However, if provisions are regularly extended without review, the rationale is undermined. In practice, temporary tax provisions are often extended without systematic review, undermining the rationale for enacting them temporarily. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted in 2012 that expiration dates should prompt policymakers to assess costs and benefits, but in reality, there is no real systematic review process. The special tax treatment lacks systematic review for cost-benefit analysis, leading to extensions without thorough evaluation. Some tax provisions have not been extended, like ethanol incentives ending in 2011. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits and lack of increased consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the cost in foregone tax revenue. Tax policy can address temporary economic circumstances. Tax policy can be used to address temporary economic circumstances through measures like economic stimulus or disaster relief. Examples include bonus depreciation, enhanced casualty loss deductions, and exclusion of mortgage forgiveness from taxable income during special economic circumstances. Tax policies can be enacted temporarily to address special economic circumstances, such as enhanced casualty loss deductions or net operating loss carrybacks. Examples include exclusion of mortgage forgiveness from taxable income during the housing crisis and payroll tax cuts. These provisions are argued to expire once the situation is resolved, or for budgetary reasons. Provisions enacted for temporary situations, like tax policies, may expire once resolved for budgetary reasons. It is easier to offset short-term extensions than long-term ones. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, not regularly extended. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline, potentially overstating projected revenues if extensions are routine. Temporary tax provisions have a smaller impact on the long-term fiscal outlook, acting as federal subsidies for eligible activities. Temporary tax provisions, known as extenders, influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity is crucial for policymakers. Extenders can be efficient but not equitable, or vice versa, requiring careful consideration in decision-making. Extenders provide subsidies to influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Policymakers must consider economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity when evaluating their impact. Market failures may justify tax distortions to improve economic efficiency. According to theory, tax extenders can improve economic welfare by addressing market failures. They are effective if they stimulate desired activity better than direct subsidies. Direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting specific goals. A tax extender can reduce economic efficiency if it does not address a specific market failure. It may be more effective than direct subsidies in stimulating desired activity. However, direct spending programs are often better at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxation contributes to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden, but tax benefits such as extenders can lead to differential treatment based on engagement in tax-subsidized activities. Tax extenders can result in unequal tax burdens for individuals with similar incomes, deviating from the principles of horizontal equity. They are considered inequitable as they benefit those with a greater ability to pay taxes, leading to unfair distribution among people with different financial capabilities. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens, deviating from principles of horizontal equity. They benefit those with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system and impacting vertical equity. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens, deviating from principles of horizontal equity. An example of the impact on vertical equity is illustrated by two teachers claiming a tax deduction for classroom expenses, with the higher-income teacher receiving a greater benefit than the lower-income teacher. The tax extenders contribute to the complexity of the tax code, increasing costs for both the government and individual taxpayers. Higher-income taxpayers benefit more from these deductions, leading to unequal tax burdens and deviating from principles of equity. The complexity of temporary tax provisions, not included in cost-benefit analysis, adds to tax code difficulty and costs for taxpayers. Numerous expired provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, categorized as individual, business, charitable, or. Most provisions extended in P.L. 114-113, including individual tax extenders like the above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses incurred by school teachers. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses incurred by school teachers is the longest-standing individual tax extender provision that expired at the end of 2014. Other individual provisions that have been extended more than once include the deduction for state and local sales taxes, the above-the-line deduction for tuition and related expenses, the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, and the parity for. Several individual provisions, such as the deduction for state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit benefits, were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Additionally, all business provisions that expired in 2014 had been extended multiple times. The business provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) allocation limitation, and active financing exception under Subpart F, were not extended. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances also expired. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances expired at the end of 2014. However, some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, including the research tax credit, enhanced expensing under Section 179, and the active financing exception under Subpart F. Other provisions, such as the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation, were given longer-term extensions through 2019. The business tax extenders, including the research tax credit, enhanced expensing under Section 179, and active financing exception under Subpart F, were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Other provisions like the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation were extended through 2019. Charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent in the same legislation. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019, with a phase-down starting in 2017, as part of P.L. 114-113. Several temporary energy-related tax provisions that expired in 2014 were first enacted in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The PTC was extended through 2016 by P.L. 114-113, with a phase-down for wind starting in 2017. Various energy-related tax provisions from EPACT05 were also extended, including credits for energy efficient homes and buildings, and incentives for alternative technology vehicles. The tax incentives for energy efficient commercial buildings and nonbusiness energy property were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The alternative motor vehicle credit for fuel cell vehicles expired in 2014. Other incentives for alternative motor vehicles, such as hybrids and advanced lean-burn technology, were also included in EPACT05. The tax credit for fuel cell vehicles expired at the end of 2014, along with other incentives for alternative motor vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 and was not extended until the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015. The tax credit for fuel cell vehicles and two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, with Congress regularly extending expired or expiring tax provisions. In P.L. 114-113, Congress extended expired or expiring tax provisions and made certain provisions permanent, increasing the cost of tax extenders. The total cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $202.1 billion attributed to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. The extensions of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. Nearly one-third of this cost is due to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017 and the two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The total cost of extending the tax extender provisions is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with 89% of the total cost associated with permanent provisions. The estimated cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of this cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $361.4 billion. Only a small portion, less than 3%, was for a two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016. The cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is $361.4 billion, with only $17.7 billion for a two-year extension of expired provisions. Legislation in the 114th Congress considered making certain tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired provisions through 2016. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The JCT estimated that this extension would cost $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window, excluding macroeconomic effects. The cost of extending expired provisions in S. 1946 was $86.6 billion over 10 years, excluding macroeconomic effects. Including macroeconomic effects, the cost was $96.9 billion. The JCT expects certain provisions to boost economic growth in the near term, resulting in a lower cost estimate when macroeconomic effects are considered. The cost estimate for extending expired provisions in S. 1946 is expected to increase economic growth in the near term. Including macroeconomic effects, the cost estimate is lower than without them. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides estimated costs of extending all tax provisions scheduled to expire before 2025. The JCT's macroeconomic analysis increased economic growth for S. 1946, leading to a lower cost estimate. The CBO estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. Extending expiring tax provisions would cost billions over the 2016-2025 budget window, with bonus depreciation at $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing at $60.8 billion, and other credits at $202.8 billion. Most of the provisions set to expire had already expired by 2014. The cost of extending expiring tax provisions from 2016-2025 is significant, with bonus depreciation at $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing at $60.8 billion, and other credits at $202.8 billion. CBO's revenue projections do not account for expected extensions, leading to smaller projected budget deficits compared to actual deficits likely to occur. The CBO's revenue projections in the current law baseline are higher than actual revenue levels, leading to smaller projected budget deficits. Providing a short-term extension for expiring tax provisions is less costly than extending them through the budget window. Some argue that CBO scores offer a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions. The CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions, such as extenders legislation. The 10-year revenue cost of temporarily extending expiring provisions may be less than in 2015 due to timing provisions like bonus depreciation. The 10-year revenue cost of extending expiring provisions may be lower than in 2015, as many are tax deferrals or timing provisions like bonus depreciation. For example, the one-year extension of bonus depreciation in 2014 cost $1.2 billion over 10 years, but $45.3 billion in 2015, with costs recovered later. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2019 at a cost of $11.3 billion over 10 years. The cost of extending bonus depreciation through 2019 was $11.3 billion over 10 years, with much of the estimated revenue cost in 2016, 2017, and 2018 recovered later in the budget window. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over the 10-year budget. Bonus depreciation shifts cost recovery forward, resulting in revenue losses in earlier years, with part of that revenue loss recovered in later years. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. Legislation passed in December 2015 made certain temporary tax provisions permanent and extended others temporarily. The House and Senate have considered legislation to make certain expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extend them. The Senate Finance Committee reported a bill to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016. Before P.L. 114-113 was signed into law, the Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to extend expired tax provisions through 2016. The House had passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent. The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 636) aimed to make enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 permanent and extend expired S corporation provisions. The Act of 2015 (H.R. 636) aimed to make permanent the enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and extend expired S corporation provisions. It also included provisions from bills such as the Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act of 2015 (H.R. 629) and the Permanent S Corporation Charitable Contribution Act of 2015 (H.R. 630). Additionally, the America Gives More Act of 2015 (H.R. 644) included three expired charitable provisions related to food inventory deductions, tax-free IRA distributions for charitable purposes, and special rules for contributions of capital gain real property for conservation purposes. The America Gives More Act of 2015 (H.R. 644) included provisions for enhanced deduction for food inventory, tax-free IRA distributions for charity, and special rules for capital gain property contributions for conservation. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 (H.R. 880) aimed to make the research tax credit permanent. Legislation was also passed to allow deductions for state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes (H.R. 622), totaling $317.5 billion over 10 years. During the 113th and 114th Congress, various bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions. Ultimately, a one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was passed. During the 114th Congress, legislation was considered to make permanent expired provisions. A one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was passed during the 113th Congress. The Senate Finance Committee proposed a two-year extenders package, the EXPIRE Act, to extend provisions through 2015. The House also considered legislation for expiring provisions. The Finance Committee reported the EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) to extend expiring provisions through 2015. The House passed legislation to make certain tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Permanently extending nine tax provisions, including six from the Jobs for America Act and three from the America Gives More Act of 2014, would reduce revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to make two additional international-related extender provisions permanent, but was not considered by the full House. Several provisions that expired in 2013 were not extended. The Ways and Means committee reported legislation during the 113th Congress to make two international-related extender provisions permanent, but it was not considered by the full House. Some provisions that expired in 2013 were not extended as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not included in the EXPIRE Act, but have since been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 without an expiration date, but a termination date was added in 2011. It was modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. The health coverage tax credit was modified and extended through December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended in recent legislation. Incentives for alternative technology vehicles have mostly expired, with some still available for plug-in electric vehicles. In recent years, incentives for alternative technology vehicles have mostly expired, with some still available for plug-in electric vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, while other energy-related provisions were not extended past their termination date in January 1, 2014. The EXPIRE Act did not propose extending these provisions. The EXPIRE Act did not extend certain provisions related to tax-exempt bond financing for facilities in the New York Liberty Zone and nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by the 2008 Midwestern storms."
