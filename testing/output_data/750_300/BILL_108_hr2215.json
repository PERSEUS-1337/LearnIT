    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. Between 1,800,000 and 3,500,000 Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. The economic impact of swimming-related illnesses is estimated at $28 billion per year in the United States. Many sewer systems do not regularly monitor for contamination. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, leading to economic losses of $2 billion annually in the United States. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. The term \"sanitary sewer overflow\" refers to wastewater overflows or releases from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by privately owned building laterals. This includes overflows reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require owners or operators of treatment works to implement a system to alert them of sanitary sewer overflows within a year of the enactment. Owners or operators of treatment works must implement a system to alert them of sanitary sewer overflows in a timely manner and notify the public within 24 hours to protect human health. Owners or operators of treatment works must notify the public within 24 hours of any sanitary sewer overflow to protect human health and must also inform public health authorities and other affected entities immediately. Additionally, they must provide a report to the Administrator or State within 24 hours. Owners or operators must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours orally or electronically, and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. Owners or operators must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours orally or electronically, and provide a written report within 5 days describing the magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce, eliminate, prevent recurrence, and mitigate the impact of the overflow. Additionally, all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States must be reported on a monthly basis. Owners or operators must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including the total number of overflows in a calendar year, and details of mitigation efforts. Owners or operators must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including the total number of overflows in a calendar year, details of mitigation efforts, amount of wastewater released per incident, overflow duration, location, potentially affected receiving waters, cleanup responses, and actions to prevent future overflows. The State must report annually to the EPA on the details of reported sanitary sewer overflows that occurred within the State. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows. SEC. 6 authorizes $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for these purposes."
