    "content": "Facing pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit, some in the 112th Congress saw international affairs spending, including foreign aid, as expendable. Others, including Members of Congress from both parties and Secretaries of Defense, believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered budget cuts to address these concerns.

The fall of governments in the Middle East and North Africa has led to scrutiny of using foreign assistance for democracy promotion. The role of the U.S. in political transitions in Egypt and Libya has raised policy questions for Congress regarding supporting uprisings against undemocratic regimes while ensuring accountability and avoiding unintended consequences. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. This fund would include $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East.

The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in FY2013, with $2.1 billion for Iraq, including $1.8 billion designated as OCO. This was a 22% increase from FY2012. The request for Iraq included $1 billion for the Police Development Program. The FY2013 request for Iraq sought $2.1 billion in foreign operations funds, with $1.8 billion designated as OCO. $1 billion was allocated for the Police Development Program, described as the cornerstone of U.S. security engagement in Iraq. The program came under scrutiny in 2012 amid reports of significant reductions. The Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, a vital part of U.S. security engagement, faced scrutiny in 2012 over potential reductions. Despite reassurances from the U.S. Embassy, doubts linger among foreign policy observers about its effectiveness due to security challenges and Iraqi indifference.

Contentious debates in Congress have surrounded family planning and reproductive health activities, with the Administration requesting $643 million for FY2013. The Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, sparking contentious debates in Congress for over three decades. Recent congressional debate focuses on the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by past administrations. The proposed FY2013 House legislation aimed to codify the Mexico City Policy, while the Senate bill did not include such language. Previous administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA. The Mexico City Policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. Past administrations have rescinded and reissued this policy. The proposed FY2013 House legislation aimed to codify the Mexico City Policy, while the Senate bill did not include such language. Previous administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009, and requested $39 million for UNFPA for FY2013.

The AEECA account, established by the SEED Act of 1989 and the Freedom Support Act of 1992, was proposed to be dissolved in FY2013. This would result in a shift of funding for programs currently under AEECA to ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts. The House legislation merged AEECA funds with other accounts, stating that this change does not indicate reduced support for the region or the Coordinator of U.S. The AEECA account was proposed to be dissolved in FY2013, with funding shifting to ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts. The House legislation merged AEECA funds with other accounts, emphasizing continued support for the region and the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia. The Senate proposal allowed ESF and other accounts to provide assistance to AEECA-eligible countries without specifying minimum funding levels. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests drive international affairs activities. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism and other U.S. policy interests. After the Cold War, policy objectives shifted to stopping nuclear weapons proliferation and other global issues. Since the early 1990s, U.S. foreign policy objectives have shifted towards promoting development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Following the 9/11 attacks, there has been a focus on national security objectives in foreign aid and diplomatic programs. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards emphasizing national security objectives in foreign aid and diplomatic programs. President Bush established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security in 2002, with subsequent strategies in 2006 and 2010 also highlighting development. Foreign assistance budget justifications began to prioritize the war on terrorism. Development was established as the third pillar of U.S. national security in 2002, alongside defense and diplomacy. The focus on using foreign aid as a tool of national security was exemplified by large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Foreign assistance budget justifications began to prioritize the war on terrorism, with an emphasis on assisting \"front-line\" states. State Department efforts concentrated on diplomatic security and enhancing national security measures. The Bush Administration increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally with the creation of PEPFAR and explored a new approach to development assistance with the MCC. State Department efforts focused on diplomatic security and presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy, especially in Muslim communities. The Bush Administration vastly increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally with the creation of PEPFAR and explored a new approach to development assistance with the MCC. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including robust assistance to frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Funding for these efforts has been requested through regular appropriations. The Obama Administration continued initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC, providing health funding and assistance to frontline states. Funding for these efforts has been requested through Overseas Contingency Operations in regular appropriations bills. The first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance and implementing reforms for the Department of State. In the fall of 2010, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review named USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State included establishing the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. The Department of State proposed changes in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in its FY2012 budget. In FY2012, the Department of State proposed using OCO funds for temporary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress expanded the OCO designation to include additional accounts and countries, increasing its significance in August 2011. The OCO designation was adopted by Congress in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, expanding to include funding for additional accounts and countries. This designation became more important with the Budget Control Act of 2011, allowing war-related funding to be separate from core international affairs activities in the budget allocation. The OCO designation, established by Congress in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, allows war-related funding to be separate from core international affairs activities in the budget allocation. However, OCO funds are not exempt from the BCA automatic across-the-board reductions set to occur on January 2, 2013. The OCO approach is similar to the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations in the past decade. Significant emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations were appropriated in FY2002-FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations. The Obama Administration criticized this practice, pledging to request funds through the regular budget process starting in FY2010. This led to a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010, with supplemental international affairs funds still requested and enacted for that year, mainly for the earthquake in Haiti. In FY2010, there was a sharp increase in base funding for international affairs, with supplemental funds requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan.
