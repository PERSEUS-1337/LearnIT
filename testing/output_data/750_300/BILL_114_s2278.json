    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" and \"Federal entity.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Commission\" as the Federal Communications Commission, \"Federal entity\" as defined in section 113(l) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act, \"Spectrum Relocation Fund\" as established under section 118 of the same Act, and \"unlicensed operations\" as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference. The term \"unlicensed operations\" refers to using spectrum on a nonexclusive basis without protection from interference under specific regulations. The Federal Communications Commission allocates and allots spectrum. The Commission will balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules will be established to achieve this balance in future radio frequency band assignments. Consideration will also be given to permitting unlicensed operations. The Commission will establish rules to balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations. Rules may permit unlicensed operations in spectrum assigned by auction until commercial service is initiated. These rules will be included in service rules for spectrum auctions and reflected in reports submitted to Congress. The Commission will establish rules for spectrum allocation through auctions and unlicensed operations. Reports to Congress will reflect the rulemaking required for spectrum auctions. The Commission will establish rules for spectrum allocation through auctions and unlicensed operations, with a focus on creating a national strategy for unlicensed spectrum. The United States aims to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission, with input from the Assistant Secretary, will develop a national strategy for expanding unlicensed radio frequency bands within a year of this Act's enactment. The Commission, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary, will develop a national strategy for making additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations within a year of this Act's enactment. The strategy will include identifying proposed bands for unlicensed use and ensuring access to low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies. The Commission will develop a national strategy to make more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including spectrum sharing and underlay operations. The Commission plans to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations by utilizing spectrum sharing models, allowing underlay operations in allocated spectrum, and exploring other sharing approaches to improve spectrum utilization. The Commission aims to expand unlicensed operations through spectrum sharing approaches that improve spectrum utilization. Additionally, they will explore ways to enhance the accuracy of databases and systems promoting spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, as well as consider harmonizing additional bands for unlicensed use. The Commission will submit a report to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, detailing the strategy developed for expanding unlicensed operations and any legislative recommendations. The Commission will submit a report to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, detailing the strategy developed for expanding unlicensed operations and any legislative recommendations. The report will be publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. The report will also address recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs incurred by Federal entities. The report required under subsection (a) will consider recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs incurred by Federal entities related to sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed radio technologies. It will also assess the solvency of the fund if used for these costs and explore the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities. The report will assess the Spectrum Relocation Fund's solvency if used to cover costs for sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed technologies. It will also explore the potential for permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference. Additionally, it will consider other spectrum sharing techniques to facilitate access for unlicensed operations to Federal spectrum. The report will explore spectrum sharing techniques for unlicensed operations in Federal spectrum, including the access system used for the 3550-3650 megahertz band."
