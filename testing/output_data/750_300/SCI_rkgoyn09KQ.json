    "content": "In this work, the authors address challenges in probabilistic topic modeling by incorporating language structure through a neural autoregressive topic model combined with a LSTM-based language model. This approach aims to better estimate the probability of a word in a given context by considering word order and local collocation patterns. The authors introduce a unified probabilistic framework, ctx-DocNADE, which combines a LSTM-based language model and a topic model to learn word meanings and thematic structures in documents. This approach considers word order, local collocation patterns, syntax, and semantics to improve language modeling and topic discovery. Incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modelling approach improves word-topic mapping on smaller text corpora. This extension, named ctx-DocNADEe, addresses challenges in settings with limited context or small training document corpora. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models and embeddings priors outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants are commonly used to extract topics from text collections and predict word probabilities in documents. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order, representing context as a bag of words. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants are used for NLP tasks such as information retrieval, document classification, and summarization. However, these models ignore word order and semantic information, representing context as a bag of words. To address this limitation, there is a need to extend probabilistic topic models to incorporate word order and language structure. Traditional topic models like LDA and RSM do not consider language structure or word order within the context, relying solely on \"bag-of-words\" representation. In a specific scenario, two sentences with the same unigram statistics can be about different topics. The words preceding \"bear\" in the second sentence, such as \"market falls,\" suggest it was generated by a topic related to stock market trading. This highlights the importance of incorporating language structure in topic modeling. The curr_chunk discusses how topic models like LSTM-LM can capture different language concepts effectively, regardless of language structure and functional words. Recent studies have integrated the merits of latent topic and neural language models to capture semantics at a document level, unlike LSTM-LMs which only model word occurrences at a fine granularity. Recent studies have focused on integrating latent topic and neural language models to capture document-level semantics, unlike LSTM-LMs which only model word occurrences at a fine granularity. In contrast to n-gram based models, DocNADE variants capture word occurrences across documents but ignore language structure. Recurrent neural networks have shown a reduction in perplexity over n-gram models in language modeling. The introduction of language structure into neural autoregressive topic models is achieved through a LSTM-LM. The introduction of language structure into neural autoregressive topic models is achieved through a LSTM-LM, resulting in accurate word prediction. The proposed model, named ctx-DocNADE, combines DocNADE and LSTM-LM to account for global and local contexts in language modeling. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, combines DocNADE and LSTM-LM to incorporate global and local contexts in language modeling. It offers learning complementary semantics by integrating joint word and latent topic learning in a unified neural autoregressive framework. For example, the model captures the usage of words like \"fall\" in specific contexts, such as stock market trading. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of learning from contextual information in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences, significant word non-overlap, and a small training corpus. Distributional word representations, such as word embeddings, have shown to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, despite challenges in settings with short texts and few documents. Traditional topic models struggle to infer relatedness between word pairs like \"falls\" and \"drops\" in short text fragments. Traditional topic models struggle with short texts and few documents in NLP tasks. Distributed word embeddings capture semantic relatedness between word pairs like \"falls\" and \"drops\". Related work has integrated word embeddings into topic models to improve information in short texts. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance topic learning. This approach considers language structure like word ordering and syntax, improving performance compared to traditional topic models. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to supplement the multinomial topic model. This approach combines complementary learning and external knowledge to improve topic and textual representations on smaller corpora or short texts. By integrating distributed space and LSTM-LM for topic representation, the ctx-DocNADEe model combines complementary learning and external knowledge to improve textual representations. This approach enhances generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in modeling short and long text documents. The ctx-DocNADEe model enhances generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in modeling short and long text documents. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models across various datasets, showing improvements in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and text classification. Our proposed modeling approaches, named textTOvec, show improvements in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and text classification for short and long text documents. The code is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. The generative models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) BID9 and its variants, are based on estimating complex dependencies in multidimensional data. Generative models like RBM and its variants model complex dependencies in multidimensional data. RBM's generalization, RSM, is used for word count modeling. NADE decomposes binary observations' joint distribution into autoregressive conditional distributions using feed-forward networks, allowing for tractable gradients. NADE BID13 decomposes the joint distribution of binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions using feed-forward networks, allowing for tractable gradients of the data negative log-likelihood. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as orderless bags of words, focusing on learning word representations reflecting the underlying topics of the documents only. DocNADE BID15 disregards language structure and focuses on learning word representations based on document topics. It uses autoregressive conditional distributions in a neural network to compute word observations. Neural network with activation function, weight matrix, bias vectors, and word representation matrix. Log-likelihood of document v is calculated. Input: training document v, word embedding matrix E. Output: log p(v). The text discusses the DocNADE model for analyzing documents, introducing extensions like ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe to incorporate language structure and external knowledge. The model accounts for word ordering in training documents using word embeddings and LSTM-LM. The proposed extensions of the DocNADE model, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, incorporate language structure and external knowledge to model short and long texts. These extensions account for word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge, overcoming the limitations of BoW-based representations. Each document is modeled as a sequence of multinomial observations, represented by embedding vectors. The ctx-DocNADE models each document as a sequence of words with context information, using LSTM-based components to calculate conditional probabilities. Unlike DocNADE, it incorporates language structure and external knowledge to overcome BoW-based limitations. The probability of word v i in ctx-DocNADE is determined by two hidden vectors: LSTM-based components of ctx-DocNADE. The weight matrix W of DocNADE encodes topic information for hidden features. The embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized in this unified network realization. The embedding layer in the LSTM component represents column vectors and is randomly initialized in this unified network realization. The second version extends ctx-DocNADE with distributional priors, initializing the LSTM component with a pre-trained embedding matrix E and weight matrix W. The second version extends ctx-DocNADE with distributional priors by initializing the LSTM component with a pre-trained embedding matrix E and weight matrix W. Algorithm 1 and Table 1 compare log p(v) for a document v in three settings: Doc-NADE, ctx-DocNADE, and ctx-DocNADEe. The weights in matrix W are tied in the DocNADE component, reducing computational complexity to O(HD) where H is the size of each hidden layer. The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. Trained models can extract a textTOvec representation using LSTM in a deep, multiple hidden layer architecture. The trained LSTM models can be used to extract a textTOvec representation in a deep, multiple hidden layer architecture. Additional hidden layers can be added for improved performance, with the first hidden layer computed similarly to DocNADE variants. Subsequent hidden layers are computed based on the total number of hidden layers in the network. The hidden layers in deep feed-forward and LSTM networks are computed using equations. The conditional probability is calculated using the last layer. State-of-the-art comparison is done for IR and classification F1 on short texts.
