    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit private entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The National Environmental Policy Institute may receive the grant if they apply. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a private entity in the District of Columbia to design a pilot program for telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. Participating employers are those who engage in telecommuting voluntarily. Proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program defines participating employers as those who engage in telecommuting voluntarily, using telecommunications to reduce or eliminate the need to commute. Regulated entities are those under the Clean Air Act. The term \"regulated entities\" refers to entities regulated under the Clean Air Act for emissions of ozone precursors, which are air pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone. VMTs stands for vehicle-miles-traveled in the context of a proposed pilot program. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors resulting from reduced VMTs by telecommuting employees. The pilot program evaluates reductions in ozone precursor emissions from telecommuting employees, allowing employers to transfer emission credits based on the reductions achieved. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission credits based on reductions achieved by telecommuting employees. Employers would be issued certificates indicating the amount of reductions, and a trading forum would be available for regulated entities to obtain emission credits. Through a trading forum or direct exchanges, regulated entities can obtain emission credits. These credits can be presented to the Federal Government or State for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The pilot program aims to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between employers and entities to assist in achieving compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Secretary will recommend sites for the operation of the program. The Secretary will recommend sites in specific geographic areas for the pilot program to facilitate emission credit transfers for Clean Air Act compliance. The Secretary will recommend specific geographic areas for a pilot program to facilitate emission credit transfers for Clean Air Act compliance. The program will include the District of Columbia, the greater metropolitan region of Los Angeles, and three additional areas chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the grantee. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the selected geographic areas. The Secretary will also require a study and report on the program. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the geographic area for paragraph (1) implementation. The Secretary will require a study and report on the potential significance of the proposed pilot program for expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs in the designated areas. Authorization of $250,000 for fiscal year 2000 is provided for a grant aimed at expanding telecommuting and reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) in designated areas. The grant program aims to have positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life at national, state, and local levels."
