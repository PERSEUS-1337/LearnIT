    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has led to a large outbreak in Guinea, West Africa since March 2014. The World Health Organization states there is minimal risk of contracting EVD on a plane. Most airlines have suspended flights to and from the affected countries due to the largest Ebola outbreak in West Africa, with nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths reported as of late October. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher than reported. Nearly 10,000 people have contracted EVD, with almost 5,000 deaths reported as of late October. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher than reported, and some neighboring countries may miss EVD cases. Mali reported its first EVD case, and WHO is sending a team to assist with management and tracing. No proven drugs to prevent or treat EVD currently exist. WHO is sending a team to Mali to assist with clinical management, contact tracing, and social mobilization for the country's first EVD case. Efforts are being made to develop drugs to prevent or treat EVD, with plans to test two Ebola vaccines on health workers and volunteers. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms, potentially reducing the fatality rate. The organization is working on developing treatments for Ebola, with plans to test vaccines on health workers and volunteers in Liberia by early November. Health practitioners currently use supportive care to treat EVD symptoms, which can lower the fatality rate. Disease surveillance and containment measures can help limit the spread of Ebola. WHO has released manuals outlining patient care, management of contaminated objects, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols to contain the disease. The Ebola virus in West Africa is not new, and health experts are familiar with methods to treat and contain it, although the disease is spreading rapidly. The Ebola virus circulating in West Africa is not new, and health experts are familiar with methods to treat and contain it. However, the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is spreading quickly due to ill-equipped health systems in these countries. This outbreak is distinguished by its emergence in West Africa, whereas previous outbreaks were concentrated in other countries. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is unique due to its emergence in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as opposed to previous outbreaks in other countries. The disease has spread rapidly across borders, leading to simultaneous multi-country outbreaks. Efforts in contact tracing and containment have successfully halted the spread in Senegal and Nigeria. Efforts to detect Ebola at borders have led to imported cases in other countries. Outbreaks in Senegal and Nigeria were contained by contact tracing. In Nigeria, an imported case caused an outbreak infecting 20 people and killing eight. A case in Senegal was contained. WHO is investigating a new case in Mali. Health workers in the US and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients in October. No additional cases reported from the health workers. In October, health workers in the United States and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients. No additional cases reported from the health workers. The current outbreak is spreading in rural and urban settings alike, with responders struggling to isolate cases in densely populated urban areas lacking access to clean water and sanitation. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in both rural and urban areas, particularly in densely populated urban areas with limited access to clean water and sanitation. Cases are doubling every 15-20 days in Liberia and every 30-40 days in Sierra Leone. Weak health systems are contributing to the unabated spread of the virus in the affected countries. Additionally, a separate Ebola outbreak unrelated to the West Africa outbreak was detected in the DRC in August. In Sierra Leone, reported Ebola cases are doubling every 30-40 days. A separate outbreak in the DRC began in late July or early August, with 66 cases and 49 deaths as of October 20. This is the seventh Ebola outbreak in the DRC since 1976. As of October 20, there have been 66 cases and 49 deaths in the DRC, including eight deaths among health workers. Congressional actions to address the outbreak have been accelerating, with legislation providing $88 million for the response. In 2014, U.S. Representative Karen Bass and Senator Christopher Coons introduced legislation recognizing the severe impacts and threats of the Ebola outbreak. Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 113-164) providing $88 million for the Ebola response, including funds for CDC activities in West Africa and research for treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was allowed to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia and supporting U.S. efforts in the region. The Department of Defense reprogrammed $750 million from FY2014 Overseas Humanitarian Disaster and Civic Aid funds to build 17 Ebola treatment units in Liberia and support U.S. efforts in the region. The health systems in affected countries were weak before the outbreak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, leadership, and financing. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have become overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, leadership, financing, commodities and supply chain networks, service delivery, and information. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in each of these areas, exacerbating the challenges posed by the outbreak. Constraints in these components enable the virus to continue spreading. The Ebola outbreak in affected countries has worsened due to constraints in their health systems, leading to government ineptitude and public mistrust. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting armed forces to enforce disease control measures, deepening public resentment. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist in Ebola-affected countries. Governments have used armed forces to enforce disease control measures, leading to public resentment. Some have criticized quarantines citing human rights concerns, food scarcity, and possible unrest. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods following protests. Despite concerns, some quarantine zones remain. Sierra Leonean officials implemented a three-day \"Stay Home House to House\" sensitization. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Health workers face delays in compensation, contributing to absenteeism and worker shortages. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped some quarantines, but some zones remain. Sierra Leone's three-day sensitization campaign detected 56 Ebola cases and recovered 92 bodies. Sierra Leone's health facilities suffer from poor conditions due to low funding, leading to delays in compensation for health workers. The Ebola outbreak caused some workers to leave their posts due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, have started providing financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries in Liberia. Several local staff at Ebola treatment units in Liberia have not been paid for three months. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources and need support. The United Nations estimates it will cost Guinea $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the outbreak. To address the health and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak, donors have pledged support to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The United Nations estimates the cost to be $194 million for Guinea, $473 million for Liberia, and $220 million for Sierra Leone. Shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia are leaving many infected individuals without medical care, while Sierra Leone and Guinea also face challenges with access to healthcare facilities and personnel. Many Ebola patients in Liberia lack access to medical care, leading to people caring for the sick on their own and spreading the virus. The shortage of healthcare workers and facilities also affects those needing care for non-Ebola related issues. Clinic closures are impacting maternal and child health, exacerbating existing health challenges in the region. Before the Ebola outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were already high. In 2012, thousands of women died from pregnancy-related complications, and nearly 1 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday in the affected countries. The closure of clinics is not only affecting access to Ebola care but also exacerbating broader health issues, particularly maternal and child health. In the four countries, over 46,000 women died from pregnancy-related complications in 2012, along with nearly 1 million children who died before their fifth birthday. Lack of access to vaccines, clean water, and nutrition contributed to these preventable deaths. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of Ebola, leading to closures and limited medical assistance during labor and delivery. Many pregnant women are avoiding health facilities out of fear of contracting Ebola, leading to clinic closures and limited medical assistance during labor and delivery. The lack of health workers in affected countries contributes to high maternal and child mortality rates. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. The dearth of health workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia is linked to high mortality rates. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the Ebola outbreak, with only about 50 remaining after. EVD deaths among health workers have further reduced staffing levels, with 443 health workers contracting EVD and 244 dying. The Ebola outbreak has led to a shortage of healthcare workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, with high mortality rates among health workers. WHO reported that 443 health workers contracted EVD, with 244 deaths. Ebola control requires a large number of healthcare workers, with at least 250 needed to treat 70 patients. WHO estimated that over 13,000 health workers are needed to stop the spread of EVD in the affected countries. The Ebola outbreak has caused a shortage of healthcare workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, with high mortality rates among them. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. To stop the spread of EVD, over 13,000 health workers are needed in the affected countries, with 5% coming from foreign countries and the rest being national staff. Countries are deploying medics to the region due to the lack of health personnel. The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia has led to a shortage of healthcare workers, with many health facilities closed. Access to clinics was already limited before the outbreak, and now large portions of the population lack access to general healthcare and Ebola-specific treatment. Patients often have to travel long distances to seek medical help. Treatment centers are concentrated in high prevalence areas, leaving large populations without access to healthcare. Patients travel long distances for medical help, leading to delayed treatment and reduced survival rates for Ebola patients. The affected countries lack essential health services like Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. The outbreak requires various health services like Ebola treatment centers, labs, contact tracing, and safe burial services. There are severe deficiencies in these areas in all affected countries. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often infect more people as they return to their communities. Access to treatment and healthcare could halve fatality rates, with Liberia facing the most severe treatment shortage. WHO estimated the situation as of October 22. Liberia faces severe treatment shortage with only 23% of needed beds for EVD patients. U.S. plans to build 27 ETUs, with 12 by DOD. Some Ebola care beds in Liberia are vacant, and safe disposal of dead bodies is improving. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care in Liberia, with some beds left vacant. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with roughly 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt traditional funeral practices that can facilitate EVD transmission. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to EVD cases among health workers. Leaders are working to adapt traditional funeral practices that can spread Ebola, such as kissing and touching corpses. Poor healthcare quality and inconsistent infection control protocols are contributing to Ebola cases among health workers. CDC identified multiple transmission opportunities among healthcare workers in Liberia. CDC Director Tom Frieden highlighted challenges faced by healthcare workers (HCWs) in Liberia, including exposure to undetected Ebola patients, inadequate use of protective equipment, and potential transmission among HCWs. During a tour, Dr. Frieden observed poor sanitation due to water supply interruptions in health clinics, with only one out of 29 centers having running water. These conditions, along with power outages, discourage attendance at health facilities. Shortages of protective gear and ambulance services hamper efforts to ensure necessary sanitation in health facilities. Dr. Frieden noted that only one out of 29 health centers surveyed had running water in the affected region. Power outages, water delivery interruptions, and limited ambulance services contribute to poor conditions in healthcare settings, leading to overcrowded ambulances and potential spread of Ebola within facilities. The affected region with a population of 465,000 people has only four overcrowded ambulances, leading to shortages of protective gear for health workers. Limited supplies of protective equipment put health workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola within health facilities and the general population. Due to resource constraints, protective equipment is primarily provided to healthcare workers in Ebola treatment centers, leaving health workers operating among the general population at risk of contracting and spreading the disease. Shortages of PPE and supplies of antibiotics and safe blood to treat Ebola have been noted. The price of disinfectants and medicine has doubled, complicating the transportation of aid workers and commodities within the affected countries. The price of disinfectants and medicine has reportedly doubled as people try to protect themselves from Ebola. Transporting aid workers and commodities in the affected countries is complicated by poor road conditions and limited air service. Efforts to develop alternative transportation routes have helped, but limited air service remains a problem. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but many people lack means to avoid it due to poverty and infrastructural deficiencies. Efforts to inform the public about the risks of consuming wild animals, including fruit bats, have increased due to the prevalence of food insecurity in the affected countries. Despite improvements in awareness about preventing EVD infection, poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints continue to hinder people's ability to avoid infection. Before the Ebola outbreak, hunger was already a problem, particularly in rural areas where consumption of wild animals is common practice. Limited air service remains a challenge in transporting aid workers and commodities to the affected regions. Health officials are expanding efforts to inform the public about the risks of eating wild animals, including fruit bats, in areas with high food insecurity. Weak laboratory and surveillance systems are hindering containment efforts of the Ebola outbreak, particularly in Liberia where only 20% of cases have been confirmed through laboratory diagnosis. Limited laboratory capacity has led to extensive diagnosis backlogs. Experts are uncertain about the number and location of Ebola cases, especially in Liberia where only 20% of cases have been confirmed through lab tests. Limited lab capacity has led to diagnosis backlogs, hindering containment efforts. International responses are increasing, but the cost and timeline for containing the outbreak remain uncertain. The international response to the Ebola outbreak is accelerating, with rising financial requirements. WHO estimated $4.8 million to contain the outbreak in March, but revised it to $490 million in August. Over 200 cases were found in Guinea, a few in Liberia, and none in Sierra Leone by April. In August, the Ebola outbreak had spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, causing 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths. The United Nations established UNMEER to coordinate the international response, with over 10,000 people infected. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate the international response to the outbreak, which has infected more than 10,000 people. The U.N. Security Council urged member states to support affected countries and contribute to a $988 million plan addressing health and social impacts, including health programs and addressing food insecurity and economic disruptions. As of October 29, 2014, donors have contributed $493 million towards the UN plan for addressing the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $279 million pledged. Roughly half of the funds would be spent on health programs, while the rest would address issues like food insecurity, economic disruptions, and supply chain networks. In total, $894 million has been committed for addressing the outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates that $894 million has been committed for addressing the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak spreads, with half of the U.N. funds aimed at direct health impacts. The World Health Organization is leading efforts to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization is leading the international effort to contain the Ebola outbreak by January 2014. They have requested roughly $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. pledges have been made to send health workers since September. Several countries have pledged medical support to the region, including Cuba's commitment to deploy 165 health professionals, the U.S. commitment to deploy 65 U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers, Britain's provision of 750 troops, and China's assistance. Human resource constraints continue to hinder containment efforts despite increased pledges to send health workers to the region. Several countries, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, and China, have pledged medical support to the region. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and other partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households in Liberia. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners created the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households in Liberia. Community care centers will be established and managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. The Community Care Campaign in Liberia involves setting up Community Care Centers (CCCs) managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. The United States is the primary funder of the international Ebola response, with humanitarian funding totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The U.S. is the leading funder of the international Ebola response, with humanitarian funding totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The Department of Defense plans to spend over $1 billion on containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses, with a strategy focused on controlling the outbreak and mitigating impacts. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate U.S. responses to the outbreak, with a focus on controlling the outbreak in Liberia. Nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel are stationed in the region, including 700 military personnel. The U.S. global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and advance global health security. As of October 25, nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel, including 700 military personnel, are stationed in the region to respond to the Ebola outbreak. U.S. efforts are focused on building capacity in affected countries and are primarily implemented through USAID and CDC, with contributions from other departments like Agriculture, Defense, and State. These efforts have been ongoing since the 2005 avian flu outbreak. Since 2005, USAID has invested $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including responding to outbreaks like Ebola. In FY2014, $72.5 million was spent through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focusing on viral detection and risk determination. Activities in 18 countries in East and Central Africa and South and Southeast Asia focus on viral detection, risk determination, institutionalization of a \"one health\" approach, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction. USAID is implementing a multi-sector approach to public health, including animal health and environment, to support sustainable response to outbreaks like Ebola in West Africa. A Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) has been deployed to coordinate the U.S. Government's response, committing over $300 million between March and October 2014 for combating Ebola in the region. The U.S. Government, through USAID, has committed over $300 million between March and October 2014 to combat Ebola in West Africa. Resources provided include 1,000 treatment beds, 130,000 sets of protective equipment, and 50,000 hygiene kits to prevent the spread of the disease. USAID is also working with the IFRC to raise public awareness and teach disease prevention practices. USAID is supporting the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to raise public awareness of Ebola's transmission, teach prevention practices, train volunteers, and provide supplies like soap, bleach, gloves, masks. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including the Global Disease Detection program. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including the Global Disease Detection program. USAID has reprogrammed funds to support burial and body management activities in response to global disease outbreaks, including Ebola. CDC has requested additional support in FY2015 for activities related to Global Health Security. CDC has requested additional support in FY2015 ($45 million) to fund activities for the Global Health Security Agenda, accelerating efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries through various partnerships and agreements. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO country offices or foreign health ministries and forming cooperative agreements with partners. In March 2014, CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia to help characterize and control the outbreak, manage EVD cases, conduct contact tracing, and improve data management. CDC resumed technical assistance efforts after new cases flared up in the region. Additionally, CDC is training airport personnel. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for its Ebola responses, focusing on training airport personnel and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages at airports in affected countries. DOD responses have been researching treatments and vaccines, providing laboratory diagnostic assistance to Sierra Leone. The CDC has committed $16.7 million for Ebola responses, while the DOD focused on researching treatments and vaccines. The DOD announced $22 million to set up a field hospital in Liberia for EVD cases among healthcare workers. The HHS U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to manage and staff the hospital in Liberia. Military personnel will establish and supply the facility, but not provide direct medical care. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to Liberia to manage and staff the hospital. President Barack Obama announced the launch of \"Operation United Assistance\" with the deployment of roughly 4,000 U.S. military forces to support relief efforts and train health workers. The deployment of 4,000 U.S. military forces overseen by the DOD U.S. Africa Command will support relief efforts in Liberia, including training health workers and establishing treatment centers. Operation-related efforts are underway, with the first 22-bed ETC expected to be completed by the end of October. More than 700 U.S. military personnel, including personnel from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are in the region operating three mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved DOD reprogramming requests to fund Operation United Assistance and related activities, with total DOD funding for the global Ebola response expected to exceed $1 billion. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed the governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia has led to overwhelmed governments and weakened health systems. Congress has approved funding exceeding $1 billion for the global Ebola response, including equipment, technical advisors, and U.S. military personnel operating mobile medical labs. Additional funds may be requested to contain the outbreak. Congress has held hearings and enacted legislation to expand U.S. and international responses to the Ebola outbreak. Additional funds may be requested to contain the spread. WHO estimated 13,000 health workers are needed, but there is a shortage, especially in Liberia. The Ebola outbreak requires more health workers, especially in Liberia. The United States is partnering with various organizations to develop a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign's potential risks. Doctors Without Borders has raised concerns about the WHO Community Care Campaign, warning that without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, and supervision, the CCCs could become \"contamination centers.\" WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the CCCs if implementation quality is lacking, citing factors like inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols. The Community Care Campaign faces risks of virus transmission due to inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols among health workers and concerns about lay personnel like family members providing Ebola care in the CCCs. The concern arises from the potential lack of adherence to infection control protocols by non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members providing Ebola care in Community Care Centers (CCCs). WHO recommends only one family member to care for each patient in CCCs to prevent the spread of Ebola to the community. However, collective familial care and close community interaction in Liberia pose challenges to this recommendation. The duration of stay in CCCs is a concern as WHO recommends only one family member to provide care to prevent the spread of Ebola. However, collective familial care and community interaction in Liberia may hinder compliance with this guideline. Other factors like loss of income and emotional stress may also impact adherence to WHO guidelines. The need for strict adherence to IPC protocol in CCCs, including proper waste management and safe burial practices, is crucial to prevent the spread of EVD. Deficiencies in waste management in affected countries pose a challenge to containing the disease. In CCCs, caretakers must follow strict protocol in using PPE and managing waste. The affected countries face deficiencies in waste management, with less than 20% having access to improved sanitation facilities in 2012. Ensuring adherence to IPC protocol among lay caretakers without medical training may be a challenge, especially if they lack access to sanitation. Monitoring and supervision are critical for success according to WHO. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE in CCCs. Supply chain management issues may impact the availability of necessary resources for sanitation workers. The lack of protective equipment in health clinics and ETUs has been linked to EVD infections among health workers. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies, including gloves, masks, and gowns. Compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE by care takers, launderers, burial teams, and sanitation workers remains a concern. The lack of protective equipment in health clinics and ETUs has been linked to EVD infections among health workers. WHO advises incremental implementation of Community Care Campaign to ensure continuous supply of commodities to CCCs. USAID is already issuing grants to NGOs for U.S. implementation. The Community Care Campaign is being incrementally implemented in affected countries, with USAID issuing grants to NGOs for oversight. The United States Government has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. Questions remain about U.S. oversight and implementation of the campaign. The USAID has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia for home use. NGOs have autonomy over the implementation of USAID grants, with oversight to ensure program targets are met. Concerns exist about U.S. government oversight of grantees managing CCCs and standardization of quality control and IPC protocol. Critics have questioned WHO leadership in the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced effectiveness and capacity to contain outbreaks. Some critics argue that budget cuts have hampered WHO's ability to effectively respond to the global Ebola outbreak, leading to reduced outbreak and crisis response activities. The agency has also faced challenges due to staff reductions, closure of critical units, and bureaucratic issues. Some critics argue that WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by budget cuts, staff reductions, and bureaucratic issues, leading to the closure of critical units and undermining operational capacity. There are debates about whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity, with suggestions for the establishment of a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO. International responses to the Ebola outbreak have sparked debates on WHO's role as an advisory body or with operational capacity. Some suggest a WHO-administered \"Health Systems Fund\" to build long-term health system capacity and address crises like Ebola. The weak health systems in West Africa have contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola. Donors struggle with how to respond effectively. The rapid spread of Ebola in West Africa is due to weak health systems. Donors have debated on how to address health emergencies, with some proposing a WHO-administered \"Health Systems Fund\" to build capacity. Critics argue disease-specific programs worsen human resource shortages and weaken public health systems. Supporters argue that disease-specific funding strengthens oversight and monitoring of investments, while opponents believe it exacerbates human resource shortages and weakens health systems by bypassing government authorities. This debate intensified with the introduction of PEPFAR, which provided funding to non-governmental organizations and local partners for HIV/AIDS care and treatment. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was introduced to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic by funding non-governmental organizations and local partners to establish care facilities. This effort saved millions of lives and prevented millions of HIV infections, but reliance on U.S. funding put many at risk if support was discontinued. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were used to strengthen health systems for better country capacity. In the third phase of PEPFAR, debate has resumed on the use of funds for building health systems. A 2013 GAO report highlighted that 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Deborah Birx aims to allocate 50% of all PEPFAR resources for this purpose. PEPFAR funds, including those from the \"other\" budget category, are planned to allocate 50% for care and treatment activities under Deborah Birx's leadership. Concerns arise that adhering to budgetary reforms may hinder health system strengthening efforts. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the Ebola outbreak, needing focused support for containment. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, needing focused support for containment and end the outbreak. Donors must support the development of strong health systems to detect, prevent, and respond to potential disease outbreaks in the future. Ken Isaacs highlighted this challenge at a congressional hearing in August 2014. Ken Isaacs, VP of International Programs at Samaritan's Purse, emphasized the need for a focus on containment during health crises like Ebola. USAID has formed a group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak. The Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group aims to support health care delivery and bolster health systems post-outbreak. Despite efforts by PEPFAR and other U.S.-funded programs, there is a lack of specific appropriations for health system strengthening. The majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader health system activities. The affected countries' inability to respond to unforeseen health events may prompt Congress to review global health fund appropriations. The ongoing Ebola outbreak has prompted various U.S. agencies to respond, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements, USAID coordinating responses, CDC heading public health activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows them to address this unforeseen event effectively. The CDC is leading public health and medical response activities, while DOD is providing support for foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows them to respond effectively to the Ebola outbreak. The Department of State's coordination of diplomatic engagements does not require additional funding. Outbreak responses by the CDC can be financed through various accounts. The CDC and DOD can respond to outbreaks effectively through existing channels without needing additional funding. USAID and DOD budgets support various health activities without detailed congressional direction. Congress provides specific directives to USAID on fund usage. USAID often receives specific direction from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak without reprogramming funds from ongoing health efforts. Currently, USAID is reallocating funds from preventing future outbreaks and addressing ongoing outbreaks to respond to the Ebola outbreak, as well as other health crises such as H7N9 avian influenza in China and MERS-CoV in the Middle East. According to USAID, funds are being reprogrammed from ongoing health efforts to address the current Ebola outbreak, as well as other health crises like H7N9 avian influenza in China and MERS-CoV in the Middle East. Supporters believe the appropriation structure ensures congressional priorities are met, while opponents argue it limits the agility needed in the field and hinders the impact and sustainability of health and development efforts during disease outbreaks. USAID pandemic preparedness efforts focus on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, but with Ebola now in West Africa, another outbreak may occur. Congressional directives are seen as hindering agility in the field and limiting the impact of health and development efforts during disease outbreaks. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is lower than the previous year, hindering efforts to contain outbreaks in regions like West Africa. Even if funding is increased, it may not be enough to meet current demands. Experts predict the outbreak could be contained by the end of January, but high death tolls are causing social disruptions. Despite preparedness programs at the FY2014 funding level, experts predict the Ebola outbreak could be contained by the end of January. However, high death tolls are disrupting social structures and leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns also arise about the growing number of orphaned children from Ebola. The Ebola outbreak is leaving vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, without resources for agriculture and food. There is a growing number of orphaned children who are particularly vulnerable to marginalization due to fear of the virus. Countries in West and Central Africa already had large orphan populations due to armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. The outbreak is hindering governments' capacity to address health issues like obstetrical complications. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to a significant increase in orphaned children, with over 4 million losing a parent to AIDS in 2012. This has further strained the region's healthcare system, impacting child and maternal mortality rates. Experts fear that the outbreak's full health effects may not be realized until it is contained. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to an increase in orphaned children and strained the healthcare system. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, leading to potential debates over global health assistance funds allocation. Congress may face arguments for various health and development issues worsened by Ebola, including maternal and child mortality, poverty, and water-borne infections. Several Ebola outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa since 1976, with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to determine their effectiveness in treating Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) symptoms and increasing the chances of survival. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to treat Ebola Virus Disease symptoms and increase survival chances. There is no post-exposure prophylaxis for health workers facing regular exposure to Ebola. The debate surrounds the ethical use of experimental drugs, with concerns about equity in distribution. The debate over the ethical use of experimental drugs for Ebola treatment raises concerns about equity in distribution and potential mistrust in healthcare workers.
