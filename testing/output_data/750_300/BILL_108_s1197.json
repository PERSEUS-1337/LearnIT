    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of ensuring radiologic excellence. Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health, safety, and interstate commerce is significant, making it crucial to prioritize public health and safety. The impact of radiation therapy treatments on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is substantial. It is important to minimize unnecessary exposure to radiation by ensuring that personnel have appropriate education and credentials. Additionally, there is a need for a continuous supply of well-educated individuals and proper accreditation and certification programs administered by State governments. The importance of having well-educated individuals with proper credentials in medical imaging and radiation therapy is crucial for public health and safety. It is necessary for personnel to demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience to protect against unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy must demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience to ensure public health and safety. Both State and Federal Governments are responsible for protecting against unnecessary procedures and ensuring efficacy. These facilities impact interstate commerce as patients often travel across state lines for these services. In 1981, Congress passed the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, setting federal standards for education programs in medical imaging and radiation therapy. This legislation aimed to ensure competence in facilities providing these services, which impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for treatment. The Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 established federal standards for education programs in medical imaging and radiation therapy, as well as certification and licensing requirements for individuals in these fields. Despite this, 13 states do not mandate licensure for those performing medical imaging procedures. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, 13 states do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy, while others have varying licensing requirements for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, and medical physicists. The Act aims to ensure accreditation and licensure for individuals involved in patient dose management for medical imaging and radiation therapy. 28 states license radiation therapists, 22 states license nuclear medicine technologists, 8 states license or require board certification for medical physicists, and no states regulate medical dosimetrists. The Act aims to ensure accreditation and licensure for individuals involved in patient dose management for medical imaging and radiation therapy to guarantee safety and accuracy in these procedures. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, accreditation, and other requirements. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The Secretary will ensure individuals meet these standards before undergoing procedures. The Secretary will establish standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy, including certification requirements for individuals performing these procedures. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards and requirements for certifying approved bodies for accrediting educational programs in medical imaging or radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for certifying approved bodies for accrediting educational programs in medical imaging or radiation therapy, including approval of curricula, instructors, reasonable fees, and other required standards. Approved bodies must provide assurances of compliance with these standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide necessary information. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet established standards. The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if it does not meet standards. If certification is withdrawn, accreditation or exam completion remains valid for a reasonable period. The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if it does not meet standards. Accreditation or exam completion remains valid for a reasonable period for individuals to obtain another accreditation or complete another examination. Existing State standards will be deemed compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate approved bodies periodically and include the results in a report to the Senate and House committees. The Secretary will periodically evaluate approved bodies and include the results in a report to the Senate and House committees, ensuring that all programs for medical imaging or radiation therapy meet established standards. Additionally, alternative standards for rural areas will be considered. The Secretary will ensure that all programs for medical imaging or radiation therapy meet established standards, including alternative standards for rural areas if deemed necessary. The Secretary may develop alternative standards for rural areas to ensure access to quality medical imaging. Regulations must be promulgated within 18 months to implement this section. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 18 months to implement the section, defining terms like 'approved body' and 'medical imaging'. The curr_chunk discusses the administration of examinations for individuals involved in medical imaging or radiation therapy, defining terms like 'medical imaging' and 'perform'. It specifies that medical imaging includes diagnostic X-rays, nuclear medicine, and magnetic resonance procedures. The curr_chunk defines terms related to medical imaging and radiation therapy, including 'perform' and 'plan'. It involves exposing patients to radiation or magnetic fields for imaging or therapy purposes and preparing for these procedures. The curr_chunk defines terms related to medical imaging and radiation therapy, including 'plan' and 'radiation therapy'. It involves preparing for procedures by evaluating site-specific information and customizing the procedure for the patient. The curr_chunk defines radiation therapy as a procedure intended for disease treatment through radiation emission."
