    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges the serious decline of crane populations in many countries, which threatens the long-term survival of the species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five species of Asian cranes are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Convention. The Crane Action Plan identifies five endangered crane species: Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane from Asia. Additionally, the wattled crane from Africa is considered seriously threatened. The Conservation of Nature considers 4 species of cranes from Africa and 1 from Asia to be seriously threatened: wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered species with populations at risk of extinction due to insufficient conservation resources. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane, both endangered species, are vulnerable to extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Crane conservation programs would benefit various plant and animal species, including endangered ones. The establishment of crane conservation programs would provide conservation benefits to various plant and animal species, including endangered ones. Other threats to cranes include egg collection, poisoning from insecticides, collisions with power lines, disturbance from warfare and human settlement, and trapping of live birds for sale. To effectively address threats to cranes in the wild, joint commitment and effort from countries in Africa, Asia, North America, and the private sector are required. Cranes serve as ambassadors promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservationists in the United States can learn from colleagues in other countries where government and private agencies cooperate to conserve cranes. Cranes are known to migrate across continents, making them excellent ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region can be applied to other regions where cranes face similar threats. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods necessary to ensure the population of a crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection and management. Scientific resource management activities include habitat protection, restoration, research, monitoring of populations, assistance in management plans, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement, and habitat protection through community participation. The curr_chunk discusses the development of management plans for managed crane ranges, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement and habitat protection through community participation, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The term \"Convention\" refers to the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The curr_chunk defines key terms such as \"Convention\" as the Endangered Species Act of 1973, \"Fund\" as the Crane Conservation Fund, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The curr_chunk focuses on crane conservation assistance. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants seeking assistance for crane conservation projects must submit proposals to the Secretary. Applicants seeking assistance for crane conservation projects must submit project proposals meeting the requirements of this section to the Secretary. Eligible applicants include relevant wildlife management authorities located within certain regions.
