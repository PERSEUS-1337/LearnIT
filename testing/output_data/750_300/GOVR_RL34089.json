    "content": "Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the FDA and expand the agency's authority. The bills are S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, representing the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs due to funding expiration. FDA used reserve funds to prevent layoffs. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs. FDA used reserve funds to prevent layoffs, causing a hiring freeze and morale issues among employees. 30% of employees are eligible for retirement. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs. 30% of employees are eligible for retirement, causing morale issues. The bills also reauthorize two other expiring authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. The FDA, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must undergo premarket approval before being sold, with postmarket surveillance conducted by the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of various products through premarket approval. Postmarket surveillance is also conducted by the FDA. Products may enter commerce with little oversight if regulated only for safety. FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding due to media coverage of safety issues with food, drugs, and medical devices. Issues related to the safety of food, drugs, and medical devices have raised concerns in Congress about the FDA's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the agency's role in expediting safe products to market while ensuring they are effective and addressing any safety issues promptly. Key issues include FDA's ability to ensure product safety and protect public health for products not requiring premarket approval. The FDA's role is to ensure the safety and effectiveness of products on the market. Congress has authorized the FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval. Some question the agency's reliance on these fees and call for increased appropriations instead. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to fund a significant portion of its budget. Efforts are underway to reauthorize the expiring user fee authorities PDUFA and MDUFMA, which together account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue. PDUFA and MDUFMA account for the largest proportion of FDA's user fee revenue, totaling $386,695,000 in FY2008. PDUFA was first enacted in 1992 and has been reauthorized twice. PDUFA and MDUFMA authorize FDA to collect fees from drug and medical device companies for product reviews. Performance goals are set to reduce review times. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and allowed third-parties to conduct reviews. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for FDA's review of medical device applications and incorporated performance goals. It also allowed third-parties to conduct establishment inspections and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. In 1997, Congress gave FDA the BPCA tool to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on pediatric populations. This was done to address the lack of information on appropriate dosage levels and potential side effects of \"adult\" medications in children, leaving clinicians with limited options for pediatric patients. In 1997, Congress passed the BPCA to incentivize pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity for trials on pediatric populations. FDA's efforts to require assessments of pediatric effects in new drug applications were initially halted by courts until codified in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on- and off-patent drugs. Developing medical devices for children is reported to be less profitable and more challenging. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of drugs. Developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more challenging due to various factors. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases in children. The need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases in children is addressed in both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. These bills offer incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and give the FDA authority to require postmarket studies to ensure their efficacy and safety. Adverse effects of medical products may not become apparent until a product is on the market, requiring years or decades to surface. The need for pediatric medical devices is addressed in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, which include provisions to ensure their efficacy and safety. Adverse effects of medical products may not be apparent until after a product is on the market, sometimes requiring years or a large population to recognize them. The FDA is focusing on collecting data on drug-related adverse effects and granting new authorities to take action. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, leading to a lack of negative study information. In 2004, Congress and others questioned the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products due to undisclosed negative trial results, such as antidepressants and cardiac stents. Manufacturers may be hesitant to disclose unsuccessful results to avoid alerting customers and competitors. In 2004, Congress and others raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA utilizes advisory committees for independent expert advice on drugs, devices, and food, with recommendations that FDA may or may not follow. FDA uses advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food. Committees make recommendations to FDA, which may not always be followed. Concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest among committee members, with reports of bias towards drug approval. In 2006 and 2007, media reports highlighted bias and conflicts of interest among FDA advisory committee members regarding drug approval. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aims to address these issues. The slowdown in new drug submissions globally since 2000 has puzzled regulators despite advancements in biomedical sciences. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval, noting the rising difficulty of medical product development. They called for modernizing scientific tools and harnessing bioinformation to evaluate candidate medical products. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose addressing bias and conflicts of interest among FDA advisory committee members. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed to support the FDA in using scientific tools and bioinformation to evaluate medical products. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, but importation is tightly regulated by the FDA. Some consumers seek medications from foreign sources due to high drug costs in the US. Current law tightly regulates drug importation by allowing only manufacturers to import prescription drugs. Lawmakers are exploring ways to enable access to lower priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety. Some lawmakers are looking into allowing access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes a title that regulates prescription drug importation, but an amendment requiring the Secretary of HHS to certify safety and cost-effectiveness may nullify this language. FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving its authority to address new challenges in food science. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving its authority to address new challenges in food science and recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. S. 1082 includes provisions to address concerns with both domestic and imported food products. Outbreaks of foodborne illness have impacted many individuals, prompting congressional focus on food safety. S. 1082 addresses some key issues in food safety reform, with FDA reauthorization bills covering similar topics in varying ways. The report details FDA programs, prescription drug user fees, and medical device regulations. The report details key FDA programs addressed in the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and food safety. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will expire soon. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) gives FDA the authority to collect user fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the approval process. The program, first enacted in 1992, is set to expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes it. The fees are used to supplement direct appropriations and shorten the time between application submission and approval decision. PDUFA restricted the use of collected funds to new product review and established performance goals for review times. Application review times decreased, and fee revenue raised the level of premarket review activities. Congress gave FDA limited authority to use some funds in reauthorizing PDUFA in 1997 and 2002. In 1997 and 2002, Congress reauthorized PDUFA, allowing FDA to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focused on postmarket drug safety. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing assessment, collection, and use of fees. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments, reauthorizing fees for application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills expand postmarket safety activities covered by the fees, including adverse event data collection systems and analytical tools. The bills aim to expand postmarket safety activities for nonprescription drugs by adding adverse event data collection systems and analytical tools. Both Senate and House bills would increase requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public, establishing fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation and workload. The bills would establish fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. They would also authorize fees for the advisory review of certain drug advertisements. The House bill would exempt orphan drugs marketed by small companies from certain fees. The bills propose new fees to fund advisory review of drug advertisements, with manufacturers voluntarily requesting pre-release reviews. Only those requesting reviews would be assessed fees, including an advisory review fee and operating reserve fee. The Senate bill would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program into the FFDCA.

The next PDUFA reauthorization would involve consulting with various stakeholders to develop recommendations for PDUFA V, setting performance goals, and including a public hearing and review process. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program into the FFDCA, including annual reports to Congress and consultation for future reauthorizations. The House bill would also require the Secretary to make publicly available on the FDA website the minutes of all agency negotiations with the regulated industry and representatives of patient and consumer advocacy groups. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for medical device reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new regulations on reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees was established by this act. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for premarket reviews of devices, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress in proposed bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers for device approval. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012 with lower fees for FY2008 and new fee types. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act through FY2012. Both bills include lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012 and the addition of three new types of fees. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the establishment fee in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. The Secretary could increase the establishment fee in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. Both bills would extend the requirement for a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012. Fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 would be handled differently than previously stated. The bills would amend provisions related to fees collected for medical devices, allowing for aggregation of fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011. A reduction in fees would only occur if the amount collected exceeded the authorized amount for the same period. H.R. 2900 would also authorize specific appropriations for postmarket safety information review on medical devices. H.R. 2900 would authorize specific appropriations for postmarket safety information review on medical devices and make adjustments to premarket notification fee amounts, including reducing fees for small businesses and allowing foreign firms to qualify as small. Both bills aim to reduce fees for small businesses, remove the requirement to consider assets of partners and parent firms for small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. They also outline a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before FDA action, with the Secretary having sole authority over refund decisions. Annual reports are required to be filed through FY2012, with H.R. 2900 specifying the inclusion of postmarket information. Both bills mandate annual reports through FY2012. H.R. 2900 requires postmarket safety info, while S. 1082 demands data on previous medical device applications cohorts. The Secretary would have sole authority over refund decisions, which are nonreviewable. S. 1082 also requires public reports and incorporates report requirements into the FFDCA.

S. 1082 includes a feasibility requirement for electronic information receipt. The bills aim to amend medical device regulations by reducing administrative requirements and expanding participation. S. 1082 includes a feasibility requirement for electronic information receipt, which could require additional rulemaking. Off-label prescribing of products approved for adult use can result in children receiving ineffective or incorrect doses of potentially useful drugs. Off-label prescribing of drugs approved for adults can lead to children receiving ineffective or incorrect doses. Some side effects in children are unique and can affect growth and development. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies on their patented products. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies on their patented products by providing market exclusivity extensions. For off-patent products, BPCA requires the Secretary to identify those needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness assessment. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) requires the Secretary to list off-patent drugs needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness assessment. It also authorizes NIH funding for these studies and allows FDA to refer on-patent drugs without pediatric studies to the Foundation for the NIH. The BPCA reauthorized exclusivity provisions for five more years, set to expire in 2007. FDA's Pediatric Rule in 1998 mandated manufacturers to submit pediatric testing. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) reauthorized exclusivity provisions for five more years, set to expire in 2007. In 1998, FDA mandated manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data. A federal court declared the Pediatric Rule invalid in 2002, but FDA gained authority with the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA). PREA covers drugs and biological products, including provisions for deferrals, waivers, and required pediatric assessments. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA the authority to require pediatric assessments for drugs and biological products. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, through FY2012, and strengthen requirements for labeling changes based on pediatric use studies.

Both bills would authorize $6 million for each of FY2008 through FY2012 and expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics and the Pediatric Advisory Committee to include pediatric medical devices. The Office of Pediatric Therapeutics (OPT) and the Pediatric Advisory Committee would expand to include pediatric medical devices under S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. Both bills would also amend the FFDCA to incorporate postmarket surveillance measures, allowing postmarket studies as a condition of approval for pediatric medical devices with safety controls. H.R. 2900 specifies that postmarket studies may be required for pediatric medical devices with safety controls, including devices indicated for pediatric populations and those expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. Studies can exceed the general 36-month limitation to assess the device's impact on pediatric populations' growth and development. The bill also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers to request a review, during which the device may not be deemed misbranded except as necessary to protect public health. H.R. 2900 requires postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices with safety controls, allowing for studies beyond 36 months to assess impact on pediatric growth and development. The bill also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. FDA approval for new drugs requires demonstrating safety and effectiveness since the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Harris-Kefauver Amendments in 1962 added product effectiveness to premarket requirements for FDA approval in the United States. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug but assesses if it is safe enough for specific individuals and conditions based on available information. The FDA evaluates if drugs are safe enough for specific individuals and conditions based on available information, remaining vigilant for new data as drugs are used more widely. Concerns have arisen about industry transparency regarding potential risks and the FDA's authority and resources for postmarket safety oversight. The FDA faced challenges with drug safety oversight, leading to questions about industry transparency and FDA's authority. In response, the Institute of Medicine conducted a 2006 report on FDA's organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Consumers, health experts, and Congress sought ways to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public. S. 1082 (Title II, Drug Safety) and H.R. 2900 (Title IX) were introduced for this purpose. The FDA faced challenges with drug safety oversight, leading to questions about industry transparency and FDA's authority. S. 1082 (Title II, Drug Safety) and H.R. 2900 (Title IX, Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs) would establish new authorities and expand others to address postmarket drug safety problems. Both bills require the Secretary to establish public-private partnerships for a postmarket risk identification and analysis system. The FDA is working to address postmarket drug safety issues by establishing public-private partnerships for risk identification and analysis. Current law allows for postmarket studies as a condition of initial approval, but there is a need for more studies. The Senate and House bills aim to improve postmarket safety measures. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Both bills would authorize the Secretary to require sponsors of drug applications to submit a proposed REMS, with differences in the criteria they would require. The House and Senate bills propose enhanced FDA authority for postmarket safety activities, including implementing a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). They differ on criteria for the Secretary to require a proposed REMS, with the House bill emphasizing pre-approval benefits outweighing risks and the Senate bill focusing on new safety information triggering REMS. The Senate bill proposes that the Secretary can require a REMS based on a signal of a serious risk with the drug, to assess or mitigate the risk. This authority covers new indications for approved products and generic product marketing applications. All REMS must include core elements and timeframes. The Senate bill proposes that the Secretary can require a REMS for new indications and generic product marketing. REMS must include core elements, timeframes, instructions, restrictions, and monitoring. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies are allowed. Access to drugs with REMS for off-label use may be ensured. Both Senate bill S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose waivers from REMS restrictions for medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. They introduce structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement mechanisms for drugs with REMS for off-label use. Reviews of approved REMS would be required at specified times. The Senate bill S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose authority for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement for drugs with REMS. They require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board for resolving disputes. The bills also mandate evaluations by the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
