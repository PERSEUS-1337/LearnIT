    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, testing a novel transformer variant that combines information from nearby characters using convolution. Extensive experiments on WMT and UN datasets show that our variant outperforms the standard transformer, converges faster, and learns more robust character-level alignments. Most existing NMT models operate on word or subword-level. Our transformer variant outperforms the standard transformer at the character-level, converges faster, and learns more robust character-level alignments. Character-level models work directly on raw characters, providing a more compact language representation and mitigating out-of-vocabulary problems. They are suitable for multilingual translation with the same character vocabulary. Character-level models provide a compact language representation, mitigate out-of-vocabulary problems, and are suitable for multilingual translation. Multilingual training improves overall performance without increasing model complexity and eliminates the need for separate models for each language pair. Models based on self-attention have excelled in tasks like machine translation and representation learning. In this work, an investigation is conducted on the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called convtransformer, which uses convolution for interactions among nearby characters. The study evaluates self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a novel convtransformer variant. The models are tested on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Translation performance is compared for close and distant input languages, and character alignments are analyzed. The findings show that self-attention models perform well for character-level translation. The study compares self-attention models for character-level translation, specifically the convtransformer and standard transformer models. Results show that self-attention models perform well for character-level translation, with the convtransformer outperforming the standard transformer in terms of convergence speed and alignment quality. The convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer in character-level translation, converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) introduced a model combining convolutional layers, max pooling, and highway layers for character-level translation, showing promising results in multilingual translation. The decoder network generates output translations character by character with attention on encoded representations. Lee et al. (2017) demonstrated successful multilingual translation results without architectural changes, improving performance through training on multiple source languages. Multilingual training of character-level models is feasible for languages with similar character vocabularies and even for distant languages by mapping to a common character-level representation. Character-level models can be effective for multilingual translation, even for distant languages like Russian or Chinese. Recent studies show that with enough computational resources, character-level models can outperform subword-level models due to their flexibility in processing input and output sequences. The transformer model is an attention-driven encoder-decoder model that has shown promising results in translation tasks. Character-level models, with sufficient computational time and model capacity, can outperform subword-level models due to their flexibility in processing input and output sequences. The transformer model, based on self-attention instead of recurrence, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. The transformer model, based on self-attention, consists of encoder and decoder layers for processing input and generating output sequences. Recent work has shown that attention can effectively model characters, prompting investigation into character-level bilingual and multilingual translation with the transformer architecture. The paper investigates character-level bilingual and multilingual translation using a modified transformer architecture called convtransformer. The architecture includes an additional subblock in each encoder block, consisting of three parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes. The convtransformer architecture includes an additional subblock in each encoder block with three parallel 1D convolutional layers of different context window sizes. The sub-block is inspired by Lee et al. (2017) and fuses representations using an additional convolutional layer, maintaining the input dimensionality. This differs from Lee et al. (2017) who use max pooling to compress input character sequences. In contrast to Lee et al. (2017), the convtransformer model maintains input dimensionality by using an additional convolutional layer instead of max pooling. A residual connection is added for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on the WMT15 DE\u2192EN dataset to compare results with previous work on character-level translation. We conduct experiments on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). The UN dataset allows for multilingual experiments and all sentences are from the same domain. Training corpora are constructed by randomly sampling one million sentence pairs. The UN dataset is used for multilingual experiments due to its parallel sentences from six languages and sentences from the same domain. Training corpora are created by sampling one million sentence pairs from FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset for translation to English. The study evaluated different input training languages on three test sets (t-FR, t-ES, t-ZH) with English as the target language. Bilingual datasets were combined and shuffled for training, and the Chinese dataset was latinized using the Wubi encoding method. The experiments included bilingual and multilingual scenarios for training models with single or multiple input languages. The study compared BLEU performance of different character-level architectures trained on bilingual and multilingual scenarios using the Wubi encoding method. In a study comparing BLEU performance, different character-level architectures were trained on the WMT dataset, including recurrent models and transformers with subword-level training. Character-level training was found to be 3 to 5 times slower than subword-level training due to longer sequence lengths. Character-level transformers trained on a vocabulary of 50k BPE tokens outperform models from previous studies. Training at the character-level is slower but achieves strong performance and requires fewer parameters. The convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer. Multilingual experiments show promising BLEU results on the UN dataset. Our convtransformer variant performs competitively with the standard transformer on the UN dataset, outperforming it by up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation. Training multilingual models on similar input languages leads to improved performance. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer by up to 2.3 BLEU on bilingual translation and up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. Distant-language training is effective when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer in bilingual and multilingual translation by up to 2.3 BLEU and 2.6 BLEU respectively. Distant-language training is effective when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is 30% slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup compared to the transformer. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer in bilingual and multilingual translation by up to 2.3 BLEU and 2.6 BLEU respectively. Analyzing character alignments in multilingual models through attention probabilities reveals differences in alignment quality compared to bilingual models. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer in bilingual and multilingual translation. Bilingual models have greater flexibility in learning alignments compared to multilingual models. Alignment quality differences are observed in multilingual models through attention probabilities. Canonical correlation analysis is used to quantify alignments in UN testing datasets. In the study, alternative alignment strategies for all languages were explored using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Alignment matrices were generated from encoder-decoder attention in transformer and convtransformer models. Strong positive correlation was observed in bilingual models for similar source and target languages. When analyzing transformer and convtransformer models separately, strong positive correlation was observed in bilingual models for similar source and target languages. However, introducing a distant source language resulted in a drop in correlation, with convtransformer being more robust than transformer. The convtransformer is more robust to distant languages compared to the transformer, as shown by BLEU results. Self-attention models perform well for character-level translation, competing with subword-level models. The convtransformer, a variant of the transformer architecture augmented with convolution in the encoder, performs well for character-level translation. Training on multiple input languages is effective, especially for similar languages. Future work will include analyzing additional languages from different language families. In future work, the analysis will be extended to include more source and target languages from different language families, such as Asian languages, to improve training efficiency of character-level models. Example model outputs and alignments from bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets are provided in Tables 3, 4, 5 and Figures 4, 5, 6, 7. The Tables and Figures show example translations and alignments from bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets, highlighting differences in weight distribution between transformer and convtransformer models for bilingual translation and multilingual translation of close languages. The convtransformer model shows sharper weight distribution on matching characters and words for bilingual translation compared to the transformer model. For multilingual translation of close languages, both models preserve word alignments, but the convtransformer produces slightly less noisy alignments. In contrast, for multilingual translation of distant languages, the transformer's character alignments become visually noisier and concentrated on a few characters, while the convtransformer's character alignments remain stable. The convtransformer model is more robust for multilingual translation of distant languages, with better preserved word alignments compared to the transformer model. The convtransformer model is effective for multilingual translation with close languages, preserving word alignments better than the transformer model.
