    "title": "AB 1366",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540 by mandating the establishment of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. The California Dream Act of 2011 and DACA aim to make college graduation more attainable for undocumented students. However, many college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, aiming to empower and support this population to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. These centers offer workshops, legal clinics, information on programs for undocumented immigrants, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness of resources and increase employment opportunities. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging California Community Colleges to designate Dream Resource Liaisons on campuses to assist students eligible under Section 68130.5 with access to financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus of the California Community Colleges and California State University is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting Section 68130.5 requirements, including undocumented students. The liaison should be placed in the campus' extended opportunity programs and services or financial aid office. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to have a designated Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid, services, and academic opportunities for students meeting Section 68130.5 requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is also encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each of its campuses. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus to offer support services such as financial aid assistance, academic counseling, peer support, psychological counseling, referral services, and legal services. Dream Resource Centers may be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus to offer support services. Dream Resource Centers may be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space for the Dream Resource Liaison can be deemed a Dream Resource Center. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus to offer support services. Dream Resource Centers may be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California may seek and accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers for their respective systems. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
