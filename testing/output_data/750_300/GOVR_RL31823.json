    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322 by President George Bush. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the conference agreement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (H.R. 2673). The Appropriations Bill, 2004, provided a 4.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. H.R. 2673, signed into law as P.L. 108-199, included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. Executive Order 13332 issued by President Bush on March 3, 2004, provided the additional pay adjustment. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 into law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated the pay adjustment as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net annual pay increases for federal white-collar employees. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under FEPCA. The adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures and were not implemented as originally enacted in some years. More details are available at http://www.opm.gov. The annual pay adjustments for federal white-collar employees under FEPCA are not based on cost-of-living measures. The adjustments were not fully implemented in some years, with reduced amounts provided. In January 2003, employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1%, significantly lower than the 18.56% increase that would have been granted if specified by FEPCA. In January 2003, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment, lower than the 18.56% increase specified by FEPCA. In January 2004, they also received a 4.1% adjustment, with a potential 15.15% increase if granted as specified by FEPCA. This report focuses on the 2004 pay adjustments and does not include salary changes for federal officials, judges, or Members of Congress. The report discusses the 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. It excludes salary adjustments for federal officials, judges, and Members of Congress. The President may adjust salaries for administrative law judges, while SL and ST positions may receive the adjustment at agency heads' discretion. Contract appeals board members' adjustments depend on specific criteria. The President may annually adjust salaries for administrative law judges, while SL and ST positions may receive the adjustment at agency heads' discretion. Contract appeals board members' adjustments depend on specific criteria and are based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI determines annual pay adjustments for various positions, with basic pay rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI difference. The pay adjustment is effective at the start of the first pay period after January 1 each year, with the President authorized to issue alternative plans. The President can issue an alternative plan for annual pay adjustments based on the ECI, with a different percentage in case of national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued a plan for a 1.5% pay adjustment in January 2004. President Bush issued an alternative plan for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, with the Pay Agent extending these payments to employees in various positions. These employees will receive a locality pay adjustment in 2004 determined by the Pay Agent. In 2004, employees in various positions will receive a locality pay adjustment determined by the Pay Agent. OPM clarified regulations in December 2001 regarding pay caps for non-General Schedule employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System have a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In 2004, their pay adjustment will be no less than the increase received by GS employees in their location. Special rate employees receive the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive special rates. Federal employees in certain areas receive pay adjustments based on GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees get the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The locality-based comparability payments procedure was established by FEPCA to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality. The locality-based comparability payments procedure, established by FEPCA, aims to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality for GS employees. The President has the authority to adjust the level of payments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. FEPCA allows the President to adjust locality-based comparability payments in case of national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued a plan for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide under the National Compensation Survey program. Survey results are submitted to OPM, which documents federal rates of pay. In January 2004, a phase-in of NCS survey data was approved for locality payments. OPM compares federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area to reduce the disparity to 5% as required by law. The overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to 5% each year by OPM, as required by law. FEPCA mandates closing a certain percentage of the gap between GS and non-federal salaries annually, starting with 20% in 1994 and increasing by 10% each year thereafter. Salaries in each pay area are to be closed annually, with 20% of the gap closed in 1994 as authorized by FEPCA. An additional 10% of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter. However, the locality pay increase has been implemented at a lower percentage each year, resulting in a slow reduction of the gap. The pay gap has been slowly closing over the years, with percentages of closure ranging from 23.5% in 1995 to 44% in 2003. FEPCA mandated that pay amounts could not be less than what is necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. This percentage is used to determine locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President. The locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President are determined based on the percentage applied to the target pay gap in each pay area. The gaps used for locality payments are 22 months old by the adjustment date, with March 2002 gaps influencing January 2004 payments. NCS surveys were not used for locality payments in January 2000-2003, and are being phased in for January 2004 payments. The March 2002 gaps were determined using OCSP survey data and NCS survey. The gaps for locality payments in January 2000-2003 were determined using outdated OCSP survey data, with some data being at least seven years old. NCS surveys are being phased in for January 2004 payments. The data for the largest pay areas, including New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles, were at least seven years old. Other pay areas had data ranging from January 1996 to November 1996. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined for the 2004 locality payments by aging BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2002. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps for 2004 locality payments were determined by aging BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2002. The overall gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%, with an average of 25.73% needed to reduce the disparity to 5% as mandated by FEPCA. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises to close the pay gap, ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The new locality rates replace existing ones, derived by comparing 2003 payments. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The comparison of 2003 payments resulted in recommended increases in locality rates from 11.90% to 25.23% in the San Francisco pay area, and 17.31% in the Washington, DC pay area. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% in 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The comparison of 2003 payments resulted in recommended increases in locality rates from 11.90% to 25.23% in the San Francisco pay area, and 17.31% in the Washington, DC pay area. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% in 2004. The council recommended adjustments for areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in RUS. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in different areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed pay areas. The council recommended including certain pay areas with RUS in 2004, and not dropping locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at this time. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in different areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The council recommended not dropping locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at this time. Basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged. The Council plans to consider dropping some areas to increase sample size in other locations or add new locality pay surveys. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in different areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The council plans to consider dropping some areas to increase sample size in other locations or add new locality pay surveys. Basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged, including that a county be contiguous to a pay area, contain at least 2,000 GS employees, and demonstrate economic linkage with the pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in different areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The council suggested an exception for Barnstable County, MA, which is not in a separate locality pay area and meets all criteria except for being cut off by the Boston locality pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address the county's unique situation of not being in a separate locality pay area on the eastern seaboard. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address the county's unique situation. Additionally, St. Mary's County, MD was recommended to be included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD pay area, Santa Barbara County, CA in the Los Angeles pay area, and New London, CT in the Hartford, CT pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004. Additionally, St. Mary's County, MD was recommended to be included in the DC-Baltimore, MD pay area, Santa Barbara County, CA in the Los Angeles pay area, and New London, CT in the Hartford, CT pay area. New London and Santa Barbara have fallen below the employment threshold required for inclusion. The council recommended that once an area is approved, it should not be removed during the locality pay program phase-in. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004. Additionally, St. Mary's County, MD was recommended to be included in the DC-Baltimore, MD pay area, Santa Barbara County, CA in the Los Angeles pay area, and New London, CT in the Hartford, CT pay area. The council noted upcoming changes in locality pay area definitions due to new census data and revamping by OMB and the Census Bureau. A major review of the locality pay program is planned for 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended changes to locality pay areas in 2004 based on new census data and OMB/Census Bureau revamping. Monterey County, CA and Rhode Island were recommended for inclusion in pay areas. A major review of the locality pay program is planned for 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Rhode Island in the Boston pay area in 2004 due to its small county size. Rhode Island was unable to meet the criteria of having at least 2,000 GS employees in a county, so the council suggested adopting \"Full State\" criteria for this case. Rhode Island meets the criteria for inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004 under the \"Full State\" criteria. The state is considered as a single county due to its small size. Installation criteria require at least 1,000 GS employees within 10 miles of the prime-critical survey boundary area. An installation must have at least 1,000 GS employees within 10 miles of the prime-critical survey boundary area, with a significant number commuting from the pay area. Edwards Air Force Base was included in the Los Angeles pay area in 1994, despite no longer meeting employment criteria. The council recommended its continued inclusion in 2004. The council recommended that Edwards Air Force Base be included in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004, despite no longer meeting employment criteria. The council also recommended improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent. The council's memorandum to the Pay Agent on the 2004 locality payments provided a progress report on improvements and progress. OPM has developed a four-factor evaluation system for federal grade levels, and BLS will phase in the new approach in December 2003. BLS has also created an econometric model to estimate salaries for non-randomly selected jobs. BLS has successfully used a new approach in field tests and will begin phasing it into surveys in December 2003. They have developed an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in the surveys. OPM formed an interagency working group to improve job matching and provide subcategories for occupations. OPM formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used this crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data delivery. Additional improvements are expected in the crosswalk, with OPM providing updated GS employment information to BLS annually. Grade supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised, adjusting the grade level accordingly. BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed a new approach for grading based on the highest level of work supervised. BLS and Pay Agent staff have developed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised. They plan to conduct final tests of this approach in the fall and implement it in surveys by December 2003. Additionally, BLS has created criteria to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government, including methods for excluding non-Federal jobs above this classification. The BLS has developed methods to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government, excluding non-Federal jobs above this level. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments in 2004 due to concerns about its reliability. Further implementation of NCS data should be contingent on action by BLS. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments in 2004 due to concerns about its reliability. Additional resources should be committed by BLS to increase the sample size of its surveys, particularly in localities with significant pay gaps. The NCS data is recommended for locality payments, with caution due to reliability concerns. BLS should increase sample size in areas with significant pay gaps. Locality pay areas no longer change automatically with OMB definitions of metropolitan areas. OPM published final regulations on April 22, 2003, stating that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with OMB definitions of metropolitan areas. OPM recently modified GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions, allowing for review before making recommendations in 2003. Major changes considered included differences in new statistical area definitions from those used since the 1990s in the locality pay program. In 2003, the council and Pay Agent considered major changes to the locality pay program, including new statistical area definitions and the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluating outlying counties, and commuting threshold levels have been adjusted. The Federal Salary Council working group reviewed new OMB definitions and commuting patterns for the locality pay program in 2003. The group recommended using the new MSA definitions and asked for no decisions to be made until further discussion. The Federal Salary Council working group presented initial findings on September 3, 2003, recommending the use of new MSA definitions for the locality pay program. They requested further study before making any decisions, suggesting that 83 additional counties could be added to existing metropolitan locality pay areas. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended using new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, with 83 additional counties potentially being added. The Council adopted the new MSA definitions at a meeting on October 7, 2003, acknowledging changes in demographics and criteria for establishing MSAs. The working group recommended using new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, with changes in demographics and criteria. For the January 2005 pay adjustments, they suggested using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) and revising pay area definitions to include more communities. Additionally, they proposed folding three pay areas with gaps below RUS into RUS to survey other areas with resulting savings. The working group recommended revising area definitions for locality pay, including using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) and folding three pay areas with gaps below RUS into RUS to survey other areas. The council adopted these recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments, with OPM planning to publish proposed changes in the Federal Register for public comment. In 2004, OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989, offered by Representative Sam Farr, was agreed to by the House of Representatives. The amendment states that none of the funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill could be used to disestablish any pay locality. The amendment at Section 742 in the Transportation/Treasury bill prohibits the use of funds to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Sam Farr withdrew a similar amendment during the bill markup, but later testified about the impact on federal employees in Monterey County, California. Farr testified about the pay reduction for federal employees in Monterey County, California, if it was not included in the San Francisco locality pay area. Senator Jack Reed's amendment, similar to Farr's, was approved by the Senate during the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill consideration on October 23, 2003. The amendment ensured that no funds from the bill could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. The amendment under the Treasury appropriations bill on October 23, 2003, stated that no funds could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, H.R. 2673, included a provision in Section 644 that prohibited funds from being used to enforce regulations for locality pay areas in FY2004 that were inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations. This provision became Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its report on 2004 locality payments to the President on December 5, 2002. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report on 2004 locality payments to the President on December 5, 2002. The report recommended adjustments for January 2004 but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, the Pay Agent advised against implementing the locality pay increases in January 2004. They suggested considering alternative approaches to federal employee compensation. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004 locality payments but advised against implementing them due to the economic slowdown. They suggested considering alternative approaches to federal employee compensation. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004 locality payments to reduce pay disparity, costing $8.830 billion. They did not adopt the council's recommendation for Barnstable County, Massachusetts. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004 locality payments to reduce pay disparity, costing $8.830 billion. They did not adopt the council's recommendation for Barnstable County, Massachusetts to be included in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on issues with random job selection and GS grades. They look forward to reviewing new commuting patterns data and metropolitan area definitions based on the 2000 census. The Pay Agent recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on random job selection and GS grades. They anticipate reviewing NCS data next year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining improvements. Once annual and locality pay percentages are determined, pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS). President George W. Bush issued his administration's FY2004 budget on February 3, 2003, proposing a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment. The pay rates for 2004 are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) with the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with the 2003 pay rates to determine the net increase in pay. The FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, with the President required to submit alternative plans for annual and locality adjustments by September 1, 2003. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The cost of the adjustment would be about $2. President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay, costing about $2 billion. The plan aimed to reduce the cost of required pay adjustments under FEPCA, with Executive Order 13322 implementing the plan on December 30, 2003. Additionally, a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund was proposed to complement the pay adjustment. The President's alternative plan for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, costing about $2 billion, was implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. A $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund was proposed to complement the pay adjustment, authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, as reported to the House on July 30, 2003. No funds would be available until the OPM Director notifies the enactment of the legislation authorizing the fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in Bill 2004, passed by the House on September 9, 2003. Funding is contingent upon the creation of the fund within OPM and approval of a performance pay plan. OPM is directed to report annually on approved plans and obligated amounts to the Committees on Appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in the bill passed by the Senate in October 2003. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund, suggesting it be managed within individual agencies. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the fund, contingent on legislation establishing it within OPM. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, contingent on legislation establishing it within OPM. The OPM Director must approve an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for fund purposes. This provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The OPM Director must approve an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for fund purposes. The President's alternative plan suggested that any pay raise above 2 percent would likely be unfunded, leading to potential hiring freezes due to increased costs. Federal employee union representatives expressed disappointment with the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. Federal employee union representatives expressed discouragement about the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended replacing the General Schedule system with a broad-band system to simplify pay grades and allow managers to determine individual pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are already being implemented at various agencies. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended replacing the General Schedule system with a broad-band system to simplify pay grades and allow managers to determine individual pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are being implemented at several agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. Pay parity provisions allowing the SEC to raise salaries for certain employees to levels comparable to federal bank examiners are included in P.L. 107-123 enacted on January 16, 2002. New HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. Salaries for certain employees are adjusted to federal bank examiners' levels in P.L. 107-123 enacted on January 16, 2002. New HRM systems for civilian employees of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136. Changes to pay setting systems at both agencies will include broad pay bands, with Congress annually considering federal white-collar pay adjustments. Changes to pay setting systems at federal agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, with past adjustments set by Congress in January 1999 (3.6%), January 2000 (4.8%), January 2002 (4.6%), and January 2003 (4.1%). Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Steny Hoyer introduced concurrent resolutions regarding pay adjustments in 2003. In January 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Steny Hoyer introduced resolutions for parity between military and civilian pay increases. These resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. The resolutions for parity between military and civilian pay increases were introduced by Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Steny Hoyer in January 2003. Members of Congress from the Washington, DC, area wrote letters urging support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military in February 2003. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilians. The House Committee on the Budget was urged to support equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military in the FY2004 budget. The budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 was passed by the House of Representatives on March 21, 2003. The House Committee on the Budget report accompanying the bill included language stating that rates of compensation for civilian employees should be adjusted at the same time and in the same proportion as rates for members of the uniformed services. The Senate version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget also included this language as a Sense of the Senate provision. The Senate Committee on the Budget's report on the Concurrent Budget Resolution included the same language as the House regarding civilian federal pay adjustments. This resolution serves as a framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. Congressional recommendations on pay adjustments are typically included in the Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The Department of Transportation Appropriations bill has been combined with the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The 2004 Departments of Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill proposes a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, without specifying how it should be divided between annual and locality adjustments. The 2004 Departments of Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill proposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with no specified division between annual and locality pay adjustments. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and the House Committee on Appropriations. In 2003, H.R. 2989 was marked up by the House Committee on Appropriations, with an amendment for a 4.1% pay adjustment. The bill was reported to the House and passed on September 9, 2003, with a 381-39 vote. Section 740(a) includes pay adjustment language. The House passed the bill on September 9, 2003, with a 381-39 vote. The Bush Administration opposes the 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, proposing a 2.0% raise instead. The Administration opposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in H.R. 1588. They propose a 2.0% pay raise instead, citing concerns about funding additional civilian pay increases. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay raises for federal employees, costing DOD $660 million and Government-wide $2.1 billion. They are disappointed that H.R. 2989 does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment exceeds inflation, statutory base pay increase, and private-sector pay increase. However, the higher pay raise does not address Federal employee turnover issues. The 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security may limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. Federal employee turnover is low at 1.7% per year, below the private sector average. S. 1589, the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, does not address this issue. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 1589, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This pay adjustment may limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. The Senate approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill was passed on a 29-0 vote and reported to the Senate on September 8, 2003. Section 636 of the bill provides the pay adjustment, with Section 502 ensuring it is absorbed within appropriated levels. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment for the pay increase, which was agreed to by voice vote. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment to the appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, which included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The Senate passed the amended bill on October 23, 2003, with a 91 to 3 vote. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment be allocated as a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. The net pay adjustment in the Washington, DC area would be 4.42%. The net pay adjustment in the Washington, DC area under this allocation would be 4.42%. H.R. 2989 was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The conference agreement provides a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The Senate approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, effective from January 1, 2004. The pay raises must be funded within appropriated levels, and there is a recommendation to include certain counties in Massachusetts in the Hartford, CT pay area. President Bush signed the bill into law on January 23, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, with President Bush signing it into law on January 23, 2004. An additional 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality adjustment was allocated through Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, costing about $4.1 billion. President Bush issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, allocating an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, with 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality components. The cost of the 4.1% pay adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion. OPM released revised salary tables for 2004 the next day, available on their website. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. The recommended locality payments, authorized locality payments, and net annual pay increases are shown in Table 1. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. FEPCA aims to reduce the salary gap between non-federal and federal employees to 5%. However, the implementation has fallen short, with only a small percentage of the target pay gaps being closed each year. Congress could explore amending FEPCA to address this issue. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report that the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries is 25.73% for 2004, much higher than the intended 5% gap set by FEPCA in 1994. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment due to data inconsistencies and credibility issues. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments under FEPCA has been criticized for data inconsistencies and credibility issues. Despite concerns raised by the Pay Agent in 1993, no changes were made to FEPCA. Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys were not approved for use in determining locality payments for 2000-2003. Despite concerns raised about the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments under FEPCA, no changes were made. Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys were not approved for determining locality payments for 2000-2003. In P.L. 106-554, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to address methodological concerns. The President's Pay Agent was directed by Congress in 2001 to prepare a report on methodological concerns regarding federal pay adjustments. The report highlighted the need for improvements in survey methodology and the review of current policies for setting General Schedule pay. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper in April 2002 on compensation, highlighting the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared federal General Schedule employees' salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs, revealing that federal employees in certain occupations were paid less than their private sector counterparts. The comparison between federal employees in selected occupations and private sector counterparts showed that for about 85 percent of federal employees, their pay lagged behind private salaries by more than 20 percent. In contrast, about 30 percent of federal employees in other occupations had salaries above those paid by private firms. Technical and clerical occupations had smaller pay differences between federal and private workers, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these occupations having salaries within 10 percent of private sector pay. The comparison between federal employees and private sector counterparts showed that pay discrepancies varied by occupation. While 85% of federal employees had salaries lagging behind private sector pay by over 20%, about 30% in other occupations earned more than private firms. Technical and clerical roles had smaller differences, with three-quarters of federal employees in these positions earning salaries within 10% of private levels. The Congressional Budget Office noted concerns about the federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation, potentially leading to inadequate raises for professional and administrative employees. The federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation raises concerns about inadequate raises for professional and administrative employees. This could result in disparities where some employees receive pay raises higher than needed to match private sector salaries, while others may receive smaller raises. Even if fully implemented, the system would fail to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs. The current federal pay system, even if fully implemented as envisioned in FEPCA, would not provide salaries comparable to the private sector. Granting the same percentage raise to all workers would result in above-market salaries for some groups and below-market salaries for others. The increasing share of federal workers in professional and administrative occupations further complicates the issue. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is also a concern. Federal employment in professional and administrative occupations rose from 41% to 56% of total federal civilian employment from 1985 to 2000. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimated locality-based comparability payments of $8.830 billion in January 2004. The American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformed military. The American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union support pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military. They criticize the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. The unions question the methodology used to determine federal pay comparability with the private sector. The American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union criticize the President's proposal on federal pay, questioning the methodology used to determine federal pay comparability with the private sector. The methodological problems seem to have spread to the Employment Cost Index component. The American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union criticize the President's proposal on federal pay, questioning the methodology used to determine federal pay comparability with the private sector. This year, methodological problems have spread to the Employment Cost Index component. The President's Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented as planned. Executive Order 13322 by President Bush halted the pay adjustments. President Bush halted locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the economic slowdown. Executive Order 13322 provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. Another Executive Order, 13332, later gave an additional 2.1% pay adjustment, including a 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. The Executive Order 13332 provides a 2.1% pay adjustment, with 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 pay rates to determine the net increase in pay for 2004. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on http://www.opm.gov. The new basic GS rates are increased by the locality payment, resulting in pay rates for 2004. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on http://www.opm.gov. MSA and CMSA are defined as Metropolitan Statistical Area and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, respectively. Pay area components are described at 5 CFR 531.603(b)."
