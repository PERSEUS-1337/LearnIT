The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892) is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods and used in providing hydrographic services. Hydrographic data includes geodetic, geospatial, geomagnetic measurements, tide, water level, and current observations, used in providing hydrographic services such as managing, maintaining, interpreting, certifying, and disseminating bathymetric, shoreline, and nautical information. The curr_chunk discusses the production of nautical charts, databases, and other products derived from hydrographic data, as well as the development of nautical information systems and related activities under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act of 1947. The functions of the Administrator are outlined in Section 3. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892a) is amended to promote safe, efficient, and environmentally sound marine transportation by providing hydrographic services and fulfilling the duties of the Administration under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act. The Administrator is authorized to procure, lease, evaluate, test, develop, and operate vessels, equipment, and technologies to ensure safe navigation and maintain expertise in hydrographic data acquisition and services under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act. The Administrator is authorized to procure, lease, evaluate, test, develop, and operate vessels, equipment, and technologies necessary for safe navigation and expertise in hydrographic data acquisition and services. Additionally, they may design, install, maintain, and operate real-time hydrographic monitoring systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency. They may also acquire hydrographic data to support conservation and management of coastal and ocean resources. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support safe navigation, conservation of coastal resources, and emergency response efforts for saving lives and protecting property.

Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892d) is amended to authorize appropriations. The Administrator is authorized appropriations for nautical mapping and charting functions, excluding hydrographic surveys, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2012. Additionally, funds are designated for contracting hydrographic surveys, including vessel leasing or time chartering, with specified amounts for fiscal years 2009 to 2011. The Administrator is authorized appropriations for hydrographic surveys, vessel operations, and geodetic functions with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2012. The Administrator is authorized appropriations for hydrographic surveys, vessel operations, geodetic functions, and tide and current measurement functions with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2012. The Administrator is authorized appropriations for hydrographic surveys, vessel operations, geodetic functions, tide and current measurement functions with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2012, including $27,000,000 for 2009, $27,500,000 for 2010, $28,000,000 for 2011, $28,500,000 for 2012, and $75,000,000 for acquiring a replacement hydrographic survey vessel.
