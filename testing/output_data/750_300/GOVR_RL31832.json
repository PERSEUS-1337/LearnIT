    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced addressing penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls sensitive dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA is the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. The Export Administration Act (EAA) established regulations for controlling exports of dual-use items with military applications. Administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security, these regulations restrict exports based on item, country, and recipient entity. The EAA focuses on regulating civilian goods and technology that can be used for military purposes. The Export Administration Act (EAA) regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications, such as commodities, software, computers, and technology. Export controls are based on strategic relationships, threats to national security, and international business practices. Some stakeholders advocate for liberalizing export regulations to enhance American companies' competitiveness in the global market. The Export Administration Act regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. Some stakeholders advocate for liberalizing export regulations to enhance American companies' competitiveness in the global market. Discussions on the Act's evolution, major features, and types of controls authorized are ongoing. The Export Administration Act regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. Discussions on its evolution, major features, controls authorized, Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and maintenance under IEEPA are ongoing. Controlled commodities and competing perspectives on technology controllability are also highlighted. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with a shift towards peacetime regulations after WWII. The cold war era brought a focus on technology control, multilateral regimes, organization of the export control system, and the impact on the economy and business. The Export Control Act of 1949 was a response to the new security threat posed by the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls, including preventing the export of scarce goods that could harm U.S. industry and the economy. The 1949 Export Control Act established reasons for export controls: short-supply to protect U.S. industry, foreign policy to support U.S. interests, and national security to restrict sensitive goods and technology. The post-war U.S. export control regime established controls on stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. National security controls restricted the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries posing a threat to the U.S. A multilateral counterpart involving NATO allies was also established to regulate technology transfer. The establishment of a multilateral export control regime involving NATO allies was necessary due to the transfer of critical technology from the U.S. and the allies' own technological development. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was formed in 1949 to address this need, with controls reflecting a high level of restrictions. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times without significant changes from 1951 to 1962. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times from 1951 to 1962, reflecting a high level of restrictions. In the late 1960s, the U.S. export control system underwent a serious reexamination and revision due to the growing importance of trade to the economy. Congress passed the Export Administration Act of 1969 to replace the near-embargo characteristic of the previous controls. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the restrictive Export Control Act of 1949, reflecting a shift towards less restrictive export controls. The act was rewritten in 1979 and forms the basis of the current export control system. Amendments in 1985 and subsequent years further liberalized export regulations. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 also influenced export control policies. The Export Administration Act of 1969 was rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985, leading to further liberalization of export regulations. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a shift in the external threat faced by the United States. Despite some streamlining, the basic structure of the export control system remains intact. Calls for revamping the act have been made to enhance exports or address current national security threats. The H.W. Bush Administration streamlined the export control system, but calls for revamping the act persist to enhance exports or address national security threats. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 changed the export control environment, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export practices. The new multilateral export control arrangement, the Wassenaar Arrangement, replaced CoCom in 1997. It is less structured and members cannot block each other's transactions. Questions arise about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls on American industry. Congressional attempts to reform the Export Administration Act have been unsuccessful since the 101st Congress. Temporary extensions of the EAA have kept the export control process going from 1989 to 1994. Congress has struggled to reform the Export Administration Act since the 101st Congress. Temporary extensions and the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act have kept export controls in place. Operating under IEEPA is seen as limiting the administration of export controls and making it susceptible to legal challenges. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses, with the House passing the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 in the 104th Congress. In 1996, the Export Administration Act was passed by the House and referred to the Senate for further action. In 1999, Senator Michael P. Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 1999, which was unanimously voted to be reported to the Senate floor by the Senate Banking Committee. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns about national security. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported after hearings in February 2001. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported and passed by the Senate with amendments. The House International Relations Committee also held hearings on EAA and export controls in 2002. The Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) was passed by the Senate with three amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version of the bill, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman and passed with 35 amendments by the House International Relations Committee. The House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments, and it was further amended by the House Armed Services Committee. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence did not alter the legislation. The Administration supported S. 149 in the 108th Congress. In the 108th Congress, the House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with amendments, which was further amended by the House Armed Services Committee. The Administration supported S. 149 and opposed House attempts to revise it. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used periodically to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) containing export control-related provisions. The House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) included provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for technology and items on the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) compiled by the Department of Defense. The House version of NDAA 2005 included provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for technology and items on the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) compiled by the Department of Defense. One provision aimed to control technologies not covered by existing regulations, while another required exporters to obtain licenses for items previously exported to China. The House NDAA report expressed concern about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China, but these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in 2004. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced by Representative Henry Hyde in 2005. It focused on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes, with targeted changes that all sides could support. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years. In the 109th Congress, a bill was introduced to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years and provide authorization for export control activities. Legislation in the 110th Congress sought to amend enforcement and penalty structures of the Act. In the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced to amend the enforcement and penalty structure of the Export Administration Act. Bills aimed to integrate export control information into electronic filing, target countries of diversion concern, and require an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. In the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced to amend the Export Administration Act enforcement and penalty structure. Bills aimed to integrate export control information into electronic filing, target countries of diversion concern, and require an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. H.R. 6828 and S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 were among the bills considered, with H.R. 7112 being passed in the House under suspension of the rules on September 26, 2008. On July 31, 2009, Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The title on export enforcement does not amend the enforcement section of the expired EAA (Sec.12) like H.R. 6828 or renew the existing EAA like S. 2000, but provides additional enforcement measures. The Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) introduced by Representative Sherman focuses on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. It grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), allowing investigations both in the United States and internationally. The draft legislation under the Export Control Improvements Act would grant investigative authority to departments or agencies under the EAR for conducting investigations in the US and internationally. It allows for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce within the US and at ports of entry or exit with Homeland Security concurrence. The Secretary of Commerce would publish guidelines for export control compliance programs. The bill authorizes search, detention, and seizures at U.S. ports of entry or exit and overseas. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish best practices guidelines for export control compliance programs. The bill includes new language on undercover investigations, audit and reporting requirements, and integrating licensing requirements into the Automated Export System. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements, embargoes, and data collection rules for exporters and shippers into the Automated Export System. It focuses on integrating export control data into the AES to prevent improper shipments and address evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs. The 111th Congress is interested in preventing improper shipments by integrating export control data into the Automated Export System (AES). The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, first surfaced in 2006. The revelation that bomb detonators made their way from the UAE to Iran and then to Iraq led to licensing requirements on UAE-based Mayrow General Trading and other entities. The focus then shifted to the UAE as a transhipment hub and its export control regime. The BIS proposed creating a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, but no country was designated, and the rulemaking was never completed. H.R. 3515 proposes the 'Category C' concept for diversion to Iran, requiring the identification of countries of concern within 180 days. Countries could be designated as possible diversion concern or diversion concern, with stricter licensing requirements for the latter. The bill proposes designating countries as possible diversion concern or diversion concern regarding transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items subject to the EAR to Iran. If a country does not cooperate or improve its export control system within 12 months, it will be designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. If a country's government is directly involved in such activities, it will be listed immediately. The bill proposes designating countries as diversion concern if involved in transhipments, reexportations, or diversions. Countries failing to cooperate within 12 months will be labeled as Destination of Diversion Concern. Additional licensing requirements and end-user checks will apply. Annual report on transfers of U.S. technology to concerning countries will be mandated. President Obama announced the initiative on August 13, 2009. The legislation includes provisions for designating countries as diversion concerns, imposing additional licensing requirements, and mandating end-user checks. President Obama initiated a comprehensive review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, with Defense Secretary Gates outlining key reform elements in 2010. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced key elements of the administration's agenda for reform of the export control system in a speech on April 20, 2010. He proposed a 4-pronged approach to create a single export control licensing agency, adopt a unified control list, establish a single integrated information technology system, and create a single enforcement coordination agency. The administration's plan for export control reform includes creating a unified control list, integrating information technology systems, and establishing a single enforcement agency in three phases, with legislative action required for the final phase. The first phase of export control reform involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List (CCL) with the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and establishing a tiered control structure. This will allow items to \"cascade\" between tiers as technology evolves. Standardized licensing processes and an \"Enforcement Fusion Center\" will be created. Phase II will implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists. This will significantly reduce license requirements. Phase II of the export control reform involves implementing a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists. This will lead to a significant reduction in license requirements and involve moving certain items from the munitions list to the dual-use list. Congressional notification will be required for these changes, and consultations will take place with multilateral control regimes partners to adjust controls on certain items. The new export control system will debut in Phase III. The new export control system in Phase III will involve establishing a single licensing agency, merging harmonized control lists, consolidating enforcement activities, and implementing a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates predicts the 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year. The 3-phase plan for a new export control system includes consolidating enforcement activities and implementing a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates predicts the plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered, especially regarding legislative action needed for certain proposals. The creation of control lists is mandated by statute, but it is unclear if legislative consent is needed to change their structure in Phase II. Changes would require multilateral consultations as the lists are derived from international lists. The placement of the proposed licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity is undecided. The proposed licensing agency's placement within existing departments or as an independent entity is undecided and may require legislation. Common principles in export control legislation include types of controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. The provisions outline authorized export controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures under the 1949 Act. U.S. dual-use export controls restrict items based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact, forming the basis for items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) and Export Administration Regulations. The 1979 Act restricted the export of goods or technology that could contribute to the military capabilities of other countries, controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons. Items on the Commerce Control List are subject to different control standards for licensing policies. National security control items require National Security licensing. National security control items, listed under \"Country Group D-1,\" are subject to licensing requirements to prevent their contribution to the military capabilities of other countries. Licenses are approved on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the items are not destined for military use. The EAA controls goods and technology for national security purposes, with the Secretary of Defense maintaining the Military Critical Technology List. The list is periodically reviewed and revised to prevent items from contributing to the military potential of other countries. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) to control items for national security purposes. The list is periodically reviewed and revised to prevent items from contributing to the military potential of other countries. U.S. national security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes, or to countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Items controlled for national security purposes are subject to a foreign availability determination. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and other appropriate agencies, with determining on a continuing basis whether any item currently subject to export control for reasons of national security meets foreign availability status. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, along with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies, to determine if items under export control for national security reasons are available abroad. Requests for foreign availability determination can be made by a license applicant or the Secretary. If a determination is made, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President decides it would harm national security and enters negotiations. The 1979 Act requires the Secretary to determine the availability of items under export control for national security reasons. If the item is deemed available abroad, it must be decontrolled unless the President decides it would harm national security and enters negotiations with control partners. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, gathers data for these determinations and reports to Congress on improvements in assessing foreign availability. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, used to make determinations on foreign availability and report to Congress. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) was created to involve university experts in deciding which technologies should be controlled for national security reasons. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is looking to involve experts in determining technologies for the control list, especially for deemed exports. They aim to streamline the Commerce Control List (CCL) to protect only essential technologies for national security. BIS plans to review 1/3 of the CCL each year in a three-year cycle. In 2009, BIS lifted licensing requirements for uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries, decontrolling certain night vision cameras. In May 2009, BIS lifted licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. Low to mid-market night vision cameras used by firefighters were decontrolled if not incorporated into military commodities. Export controls were tightened on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. This supports the idea that current mechanisms can handle foreign transactions. Controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, unembedded camera cores, and thermal imaging cameras embedded in a military commodity require exporters to report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues, with industry sources noting delays in BIS engagement and interagency agreements. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress. Mass market status applies to items produced or made available in large volume or to multiple buyers. Legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress defines mass market status based on distribution, shipping, and intended purposes. The EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress defined mass market status for items produced in large volume or for multiple buyers. Criteria for determining mass market status included distribution, shipping, and intended purposes, which was a controversial aspect of the legislation. This feature was seen as a stumbling block in negotiations during the 107th Congress, with concerns raised about potential wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports to promote foreign policy. The EAA legislation in the 107th Congress faced challenges due to concerns about potential wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, compliance with international obligations, and deterring terrorism. Foreign policy controls are in place for various purposes including anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, unilateral embargoes, and non-proliferation agreements. The EAA legislation in the 107th Congress authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, compliance with international obligations, and deterring terrorism. It includes controls for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, unilateral embargoes, and non-proliferation agreements. The EAA attaches limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring renewal yearly and clear objectives reported to Congress. It also mandates negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items and imposes restrictions for foreign policy purposes. The EAA legislation in the 107th Congress authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, compliance with international obligations, and deterring terrorism. It includes controls for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, unilateral embargoes, and non-proliferation agreements. The legislation requires the President to clearly state objectives and criteria for controls to be reported to Congress annually. It also directs negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items and imposes restrictions for foreign policy purposes, including a license requirement for exporting certain items to countries supporting international terrorism. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (Title IX, P.L. 106-387). Catch-all controls, introduced under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991, are also administered as foreign policy controls. Catch-all controls, part of the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991, require a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list for entities needing licenses under EPCI. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to EPCI for items used in nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. Current regulations include a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel, as well as foreign terrorist organizations designated by the Secretary of State. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Few short-supply controls remain, including restrictions on crude oil and petroleum exports. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Few short-supply controls remain in force, including restrictions on exports of crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and horses by sea. The EAA legislation proposed in the 107th Congress did not include short-supply control authority. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing 21,213 applications worth $72.1 billion in FY2008, including $50.2 billion in crude oil licenses. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion, including $50.2 billion for crude oil exports. Dual-use technology licenses were valued at $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. Most applications are referred to other agencies, prolonging the review process. In FY2008, BIS approved 17,945 (84%) license applications, denied 177 (1.0%), and returned 3,171 (15%). Most applications are referred to other agencies, extending the review process. China received the largest number of approved licenses with a value of $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the highest number of approved license applications in FY2008. The Export Administration Regulations in FY2008 approved 17,945 license applications, with China receiving the largest value of $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the highest number of approved license applications, totaling 2,212 with a value of $294 million. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes, incorporating control lists of non-proliferation regimes. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It consists of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), divided into ten categories such as nuclear materials, electronics, computers, and propulsion systems. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into various groups such as organisms, microorganisms, electronics, computers, telecommunications, navigation, avionics, marine, and propulsion systems. Each item is assigned an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and a description of the item and reason for control. There are approximately 500 ECCN listings on the CCL. The Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) categorizes controlled items based on specific groups and functional groups. There are around 500 ECCN listings on the Commerce Control List (CCL). Items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) may be restricted based on end-use or end-user, with items on the CCL eligible for license exceptions. A commodity may be denied if destined for military end-use or proliferation. Items on the CCL may qualify for license exceptions, requiring due diligence. Some products may need a license even when shipped to friendly nations due to diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction determines if a product is dual-use. Some products may require a license even when shipped to friendly nations due to diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, dictating the regulatory regime. Exporters may seek a BIS commodity classification for less restrictive controls. Some exporters seek BIS commodity classification for products not listed on the CCL to determine if they fall under EAR jurisdiction. Requests are supposed to be referred to State and Defense, but this process has been criticized for its low efficiency. The BIS is required to refer commodity classification requests to State and Defense under certain criteria, but this process has been criticized for its inefficiency. In 2005, out of 5,370 requests processed, only 10 were referred, and renewed referral criteria had not been developed. In 2005, out of 5,370 commodity classification requests processed, only 10 were referred to State and Defense. The development of renewed referral criteria with State and Defense had not been undertaken. GAO highlighted jurisdictional disagreements and coordination problems between the two departments, leading to exporters determining outcomes until resolved. The two departments have not resolved jurisdictional disputes or improved coordination, leaving exporters to determine restrictions and review processes. The EAA and EAR establish policies for license application review and dispute resolution, with procedures set by Executive Order 12981. The EAR establishes policies for license application review and dispute resolution, with procedures set by Executive Order 12981. The Secretary of Commerce has the power to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies having the authority to review licenses as well. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies also able to review licenses. Agencies may waive their right to review certain license applications. Within nine days of registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, assure correct security classification, return unnecessary applications, grant or deny applications. Reviewing agencies must request additional information within 10 days and may request more after reviewing the file. After reviewing the file, the agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days, providing regulatory or statutory justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days means the agency has no objection to the Secretary's decision. The license application is subject to various actions. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism led by the Export Administration Review Board (EARB), chaired by the Secretary and including the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) was created by Executive Order in 1970 and consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and includes the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration as Chair. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP is the third level of the interagency dispute resolution mechanism. The Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration and includes relevant assistant Secretaries and officials from agencies in the EARB. The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP, made up of representatives from these departments, handles the dispute resolution process. The Chair, selected by the Secretary of Commerce, reviews recommendations and informs departments of decisions within 14 days. Departments can appeal the Chair's decision. The dispute resolution process in ACEP begins with the OC. The Chair reviews department recommendations and informs them of his decision within 14 days. Any department can appeal to ACEP within five days, and the ACEP members vote on the application within 11 days. A dissenting agency head can appeal to the Secretary within five days, and the EARB must decide within 11 days. The interagency appeal process in ACEP must be completed within 90 days of the application registration. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by statutory and regulatory basis. Presidential consideration of a license decision does not have a set time frame. The interagency appeal process in ACEP must be completed within 90 days of application registration. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by statutory and regulatory basis. Presidential consideration of a license decision does not have a set time frame. An explicit appeal procedure is specified in the EAR, allowing for reconsideration of an application based on specific considerations and modifications. One possible basis for appeal is an assessment of foreign availability, where a license denial may be reversed if the item is readily available from a non-U.S. source. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority from the IEEPA. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations using emergency authority from the IEEPA due to a national emergency declaration. Controls were later terminated during temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994, with President Clinton reimposing controls in 1994. President Clinton reimposed export controls under IEEPA after temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act in 2000, and President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies have been noted in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act in 2000, and President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies have been noted in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority, including lapses in enforcement power and limitations on judicial review. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not allow the President to limit federal court jurisdiction or extend the Export Administration Act's denial of judicial review. It also lacks a confidentiality provision for protecting export license information and does not explicitly authorize measures to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the US sends the wrong message by not enacting appropriate legislation. The IEEPA does not explicitly authorize measures to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. Critics argue that the US sends the wrong message by not enacting appropriate legislation, which diminishes its credibility in urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. Penalty authorities under IEEPA are lower than under the EAA, resulting in less of a deterrent effect. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96) raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and civil penalties to $250,000. This act addressed the issue of lower penalty authorities under IEEPA compared to the EAA, enhancing deterrence for violations involving national security controls. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96) increased criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals, and civil penalties to $250,000. The act also addressed the issue of lower penalty authorities under IEEPA compared to the EAA, enhancing deterrence for violations involving national security controls. The curr_chunk discusses technologically advanced goods and technologies such as telecommunications equipment, precision machine tools, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional attention has focused on high-performance computers capable of complex digital operations. High-performance computers (HPCs) are technologically advanced machines capable of complex digital operations. They include supercomputers, workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. HPC computing performance is measured in millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS), with actual performance varying based on the operations performed. The Wassenaar Arrangement approved a new standard for calculating computing power in December 2005, incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking on April 24, 2006. The new standard, called adjusted peak performance (APP), measures the peak rate at which digital computers perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions. The new standard for calculating computing power, adjusted peak performance (APP), was approved in December 2005 and incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking on April 24, 2006. It measures the peak rate at which digital computers perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications using a metric known as \"weighted teraflops\" (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous benchmark level of 190,000 MTOPS from January 2002. This level is designed to control high-end proprietary HPCs used for advanced research, development, and simulation by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. The control level for high-end proprietary HPCs used by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has been set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous benchmark level of 190,000 MTOPS from January 2002. Export restrictions on HPCs have been debated due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and the availability of comparable models from foreign sources. Some advocates argue that export restrictions on HPCs are not practical due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and the availability of comparable models from foreign sources. The Clinton and Bush Administrations raised HPC export thresholds, with the last change in January 2002 setting the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries at 190,000 MTOPS. This decontrol process has had a significant regulatory impact on BIS. The Bush Administration raised the threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS in January 2002, up from 2,000 MTOPS in 1995. This decontrol process significantly impacted BIS, with a decrease in license applications for computer assemblies and hardware from over 11,000 in 1993 to 14 in 2003. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the NDAA98. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Exports of these computers are subject to approval from multiple government departments. The Title requires prior notification for exports of high-performance computers above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries, with approval needed from multiple government departments. Encryption is essential for secure e-commerce, involving encoding messages with keys for decoding. The 107th Congress EAA versions aimed to repeal NDAA98 provisions related to encryption. Encryption is crucial for secure e-commerce by encoding messages with keys for decoding. Control authority over encryption technology shifted from State to Commerce in 1996. The importance of encryption technology led to the transfer of control authority from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. This resulted in the decontrol of retail encryption technology, allowing exports to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Encryption products and technology can be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users in other countries through a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology uses materials, shapes, and structures to protect against electronic detection, with certain materials deflecting radar signals and others absorbing them. Stealth technology involves materials that deflect or absorb radar signals to prevent detection. Export control concerns arise due to civil applications, leading to reclassification as munitions in the 1990s. Congress has debated the export of stealth-related technology. The Department of State reclassified certain stealth-related technology as munitions in the 1990s due to concerns over potential export. Congress has debated the control of exports of commercial communications satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information to China through improper transfers. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information and skills to China through improper transfers. Congress returned the authority to license exports of commercial communications satellites to the Department of State in March 1999, leading to licensing delays and lost sales in the satellite industry. The transfer of licensing authority for missile technology exports from the Department of State to Commerce has caused licensing delays and lost sales in the satellite industry. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 included a provision to grant this authority. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) allows the President to transfer commercial satellite technology from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. This category includes manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms, utilizing advanced computer software and circuitry. The manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms includes advanced computer software and circuitry. The industry claims its competitive position is affected by the lack of multilateral controls, especially regarding China. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation found foreign availability for certain products in China and Taiwan. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation found foreign availability for certain products in China and Taiwan, recommending their decontrol to these destinations. Technology related to \"hot section\" technology used in jet aircraft development is controlled by different U.S. agencies based on its military or commercial application. During debates on EAA legislation in the 106th Congress, concerns were raised about the decontrol of technology incorporated in commercial aircraft. Senators sought a \"carve-out\" for sensitive technologies to prevent their decontrol by the Department of Commerce. The civilian aviation industry has been worried about the control of defense goods by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The civilian aviation industry has long been concerned about the control of defense goods by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Section 17(c) of the EAA states that standard equipment certified by the FAA in civil aircraft and to be exported to a non-controlled country shall be subject to export controls exclusively under this act. In the aftermath of the QRS-11 case, commercial suppliers have complained about the need to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by Section 17(c) to avoid ITAR issues. Commercial suppliers have complained about the need to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by Section 17(c) to avoid ITAR issues. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations are only subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the EAA, with Commerce now having jurisdiction over a non-FAA component of a CSIS. The new rule clarifies that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and covered by a civil aircraft type certificate issued by the FAA. Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for a commodity jurisdiction determination. The Federal Aviation Administration has jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment. Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for a commodity jurisdiction determination. Technology transfers to foreign nationals within the United States are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. Deemed exports, regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, require a license for technology transfer to foreign nationals in the US. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, accounting for 5.4% of total licenses submitted. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule-making procedure in response to an IG report recommending changes to the standard governing foreign nationals subject to export controls based on country of birth. The IG recommended that BIS change the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls from country of citizenship or permanent residency to country of birth. This is because foreign nationals from controlled destinations could access technology without scrutiny by establishing permanent residency in a third country. However, Under Secretary of Commerce David McCormick announced that deemed export controls would still be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency. In December 2007, BIS released the report of the Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC), recommending a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline deemed export applications. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline deemed export applications. The program would evaluate an applicant's probable loyalties based on various factors and streamline certain terminology in the regulations. Additionally, an outside panel of experts would conduct an annual review. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended streamlining terminology in deemed export regulations and establishing an outside panel of experts for an annual technology review. Industry representatives and the research community criticized the proposals as unmanageable for the government and difficult for industry to comply with. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended simplifying deemed export regulations and forming an expert panel for annual technology reviews. Industry and research communities found the proposals unmanageable for the government and challenging for industry to comply with. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration legislation debates. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) is addressing the tension between commercial and national security concerns in export administration legislation debates. Many support reform of the current system to help U.S. businesses compete globally, while others prioritize national security. Many support export control reform to aid U.S. businesses in global competition, while others prioritize national security by focusing on effective controls for potential exports to security threats. Controversies arise regarding technology control and multilateral regimes. Controversies arise regarding the controllability of technology, multilateral regimes, bureaucratic structure of licensing process, and impact of export controls on the U.S. economy in relation to countries threatening U.S. security, terrorists, human rights violators, and weapons proliferators. The foreign availability and mass market provisions of EAA reauthorization legislation have sparked debate, with industry groups taking active positions on the legislation. The foreign availability and mass market provisions of EAA reauthorization legislation have sparked debate among industry groups, who see them as key benefits of potential EAA legislation. They argue that technology flow cannot be effectively controlled, and U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed. Unilateral controls are deemed ineffective in preventing other countries from accessing advanced technology. According to industry groups, unilateral export controls are seen as ineffective in preventing other countries from obtaining advanced technology. This viewpoint argues that current multilateral controls on dual-use articles are ineffectual, leading to American businesses suffering while foreign businesses gain new markets. Unilateral export controls are also becoming increasingly unworkable. According to industry groups, unilateral export controls are seen as ineffective in preventing other countries from obtaining advanced technology. The current export control system is becoming unworkable as the economy globalizes, with goods being manufactured worldwide. This has led to American businesses suffering while foreign businesses gain new markets. The export control system is seen as ineffective in preventing other countries from obtaining advanced technology. American businesses are suffering while foreign businesses gain new markets. Purchasing managers at Daimler Chrysler Aerospace are reducing dependence on American components due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics are concerned about the mass market standard potentially nullifying the U.S. control regime. Critics of the export control system are worried about the mass market and foreign availability arguments put forth by industry proponents. They argue that the mass market standard could undermine the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items meeting certain criteria, potentially including dual-use items used for proliferation. The foreign availability criterion could allow the sale of items to controlled countries that rogue buyers could purchase, according to a non-proliferation advocate. Industry claims that robust export is beneficial for national security. The advocate testified about EAA legislation in the 106th Congress, stating that the foreign availability criterion could allow the sale of items to controlled countries that rogue buyers could purchase. Industry argues that national security is enhanced by robust export industries due to changes in defense procurement and research. The military now relies more on commercial applications and purchases off-the-shelf items, reversing the previous trend of conducting technical research. Industry argues that export controls hinder competitiveness, allowing foreign firms to gain market share and potentially surpass American technological lead. This could impact the quality of available technology. The argument is that export controls hinder competitiveness, allowing foreign firms to gain market share and potentially surpass American technological lead, impacting the quality of available technology for national security purposes. Critics reject the industry's position, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states does not promote national security. The industry's national security position argues against selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states, citing the case of Iraq using U.S. weaponry against Kuwait. They attribute reliance on civilian R&D to declining defense budgets in the 1990s. The technology used against Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War was a result of declining defense budgets in the 1990s, leading to reliance on civilian R&D. Some argue that defense-related R&D should be funded within the Defense Department to control technology exports. Industry groups highlight the rapid advancement of computing power as a challenge for export control systems. The rapid rise in computing power poses a challenge for export control systems, with industry groups and analysts questioning the feasibility and effectiveness of controlling computing power. Increasing computing speeds and networking advances have blurred the distinction between super-computers and commodity computers, making it difficult to regulate. The rapid rise in computing power challenges export control systems as microprocessors can be linked to create servers with capabilities that breach export thresholds, eroding restrictions on high-performance computing access. The Defense Science Board highlighted the challenge of restricting access to high-performance computing due to the ability to cluster commodity computers. Some believe the US can control access by limiting exports, as American-made computers are seen as superior and offer better networking and service. Control advocates argue that these distinctions are significant. The purchase of American-made computer products is seen as superior due to better networking and service at a competitive price. Control advocates argue that qualitative differences are important, especially when networking a parallel processing system. Post-shipment verification is one policy attempted to monitor the end-use of controlled goods. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98 aims to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods, especially for computers destined for tier III destinations like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about exports of HPCs to China, as the GAO has reported restrictions on access to facilities containing U.S. HPC exports. The GAO has reported that China has restricted access to facilities containing U.S. HPC exports, and BIS has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export license terms. Difficulty in monitoring HPC exports in China is exacerbated by ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes. The difficulty in monitoring HPC exports in China is worsened by ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military. The United States is part of the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, created in 1996 as a successor to CoCom. The WA control list aligns with U.S. CCL items for national security. The U.S. also participates in four proliferation-related control regimes. The WA dual-use control list aligns with U.S. CCL items for national security. The United States participates in four proliferation-related control regimes, each characterized by national discretion, a common control list, and regular reporting requirements. Member nations control exports under their own national laws, unlike CoCom. The United States participates in four proliferation-related control regimes with national discretion, a common control list, and reporting requirements. Member nations control exports under their own laws, pledge disclosure of licensing decisions, and consult on sensitive licenses. Some groups have a \"no undercut\" provision, operate by consensus, and pledge not to license items denied by another state. The Wassenaar Arrangement is criticized for its reliance on consensus among member states, which limits effective control and consultation on export licensing decisions. Critics argue that the minimal reporting requirements hinder pre-export consultation and prevent meaningful oversight. The Wassenaar Arrangement's consensus-based decision-making process is criticized for limiting effective control and consultation on export licensing. Industry representatives emphasize the importance of multilateral controls for export policies, especially regarding exports to China. The machine tool industry criticizes unilateral export policies, particularly towards China, due to lack of consensus on technology transfer limits. Industry spokesmen argue that stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. The U.S. is faulted for strict licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Industry spokesmen criticize unilateral export policies towards China, arguing that stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. They fault the U.S. for its overly rigorous licensing policy towards China without actively persuading allies to adopt similar measures. Proponents of tighter export restrictions emphasize America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts, urging the U.S. to take the lead in convincing other nations to follow suit. Industry spokesmen and advocates of heightened export controls criticize the U.S. for its unilateral export policies towards China and emphasize the need for America to take the lead in strengthening export controls. They argue that a strategy based solely on the policies of other nations is ineffective and harmful to national security. Export control strategy based on other nations' policies is seen as ineffective and harmful to national security. Industry and advocates agree on the need to strengthen multilateral controls, but consensus is lacking on which goods and countries pose a threat. Western nations agree on restricting dual-use items to 'countries of concern,' but disagreement arises, especially with China. The export control dilemma is evident without consensus on target countries. The export control dilemma in Western nations revolves around consensus on restricting dual-use items to certain countries, with disagreement particularly concerning China. The question arises whether the United States should unilaterally impose controls, weighing non-proliferation goals against potential economic costs and national security risks. The debate often centers on China and the balancing act between economic benefits and security concerns. The dilemma of U.S. export control policy towards China involves balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and have hindered technology transfers to China in recent years. Some in the business community argue that U.S. export control policy towards China is too strict, leading to delays in technology transfers. Chinese companies avoid U.S. bids due to licensing process delays, causing U.S. firms to lose out on a crucial market. This imbalance serves neither commercial nor strategic interests. Some argue that U.S. export control policy towards China is too strict, causing delays in technology transfers. Concerns have been raised about China's acquisition of dual-use technology, evading export controls to obtain missile and satellite technology. Tightened controls and greater enforcement are seen as necessary. China evaded export controls to illegally obtain missile and satellite technology, leading to the need for tightened controls and greater enforcement. China has also been involved in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. BIS published a final rule on export controls for China, including a new licensing requirement for certain military end-use products. In 2007, BIS implemented new export controls for China, including a licensing requirement for military end-use products, a VEU program, and the need for an end-user statement for certain licensed products. Concerns were raised about the impact of exporting commercial technology to certain end-users in China, potentially undermining arms embargoes. Industry and others questioned the effectiveness of these new controls. The United States and others maintain an arms embargo against China, but concerns have been raised that the export of commercial technology to certain end-users is undermining this embargo. New controls have been established, including military end-use controls and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The focus has been on new military end-use controls on 20 product categories, previously controlled for anti-terrorism reasons, now requiring a license. The new rule establishes military end-use controls on 20 product categories for exports to China, requiring a license if the items are intended for military purposes in the PRC. The final rule establishes military end-use controls on certain items for exports to China, requiring a license if intended for military purposes in the PRC. It also revises licensing policies for National Security controlled items destined for the PRC, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to the PRC's military capabilities in key weapons systems. Additionally, the rule increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of. The Final Rule establishes military end-use controls on certain items for exports to China, requiring a license if intended for military purposes in the PRC. It also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of the PRC. The Final Rule establishes military end-use controls on certain items for exports to China, requiring a license if intended for military purposes in the PRC. It increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods to the PRC, but expands the requirement to cover all license applications reaching this threshold. The VEU component allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to be nominated for the program. The VEU component of the China Rule allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to be nominated for the program, enabling them to receive items eligible under the program without a license if approved by BIS. The rule sets up an applications process for end-users to be nominated for VEU status, with evaluation criteria including exclusive engagement in civilian end-use activities, compliance record with U.S. export controls, and capability to comply with recordkeeping requirements. In approving a candidate for VEU status, the ERC evaluates the entity's engagement in civilian end-use activities, compliance with U.S. export controls, recordkeeping capability, agreement to on-site reviews, and relationship with U.S. and foreign companies. China's MoFCom requires authorization for plant or records inspections for companies seeking VEU status. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program. The Minister of Foreign Commerce (MoFCom) announced that companies seeking VEU status must obtain authorization from MoFCom for plant or records inspections. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program, and items controlled for crime control or missile technology by the EAR do not qualify. The approved VEU application will include a list of items that can be exported to the end-user, which can be adjusted by the ERC. Once approved, the VEU can import approved items from any exporter. The VEU program allows approved companies to export items to validated end-users, with the list of exportable items being adjustable by the ERC. This streamlines licensing for certain companies, freeing up resources for more complex applications. The program was expanded to eligible companies in India in 2007, with General Electric India being the first participant. On October 2, 2007, BIS expanded the VEU program to eligible companies in India, with General Electric India being the first participant. On October 19, 2007, the first five VEU companies were announced, including Applied Materials China, National Semiconductor, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, SMIC, and HHNEC. These companies imported licensed goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. In 2006, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, SMIC, and HHNEC imported licensed goods valued at $54.3 million. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their affiliations with government-owned companies doing business with the Chinese military, potentially violating U.S. proliferation sanctions and export control laws. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso responded to these concerns. The Wisconsin Project raised concerns about companies doing business with the Chinese military, citing potential violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended these companies, stating they have a history of using U.S. technology. Controversy surrounding the Validated End-User (VEU) program continues, with a GAO study recommending its suspension in 2008. The Validated End-User (VEU) program continues to face controversy, with a GAO study recommending its suspension in 2008 due to issues with conducting on-site reviews of validated end-users in China. Commerce has conducted checks under the pre-existing 2004 end-use verification understanding (EUVU) to address concerns. The Validated End-User (VEU) program in China faces challenges with on-site reviews and selection criteria for candidates. Commerce has conducted checks under the 2004 end-use verification understanding (EUVU) but requires an end-use statement from MoFCom for inspections to take place. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China in 2009 with procedures for secure operation. The VEU program in China faces challenges with on-site reviews and selection criteria. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China in 2009 with procedures for secure operation. Representative Markey cited concerns about VEU approved entities sharing addresses with sanctioned firms. China, shared an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned by the State Department in 2006 for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input on licensing. The Defense Technology Security Agency conducts national security reviews for license applications, and the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear purposes. The Defense Technology Security Agency in the Department of Defense conducts national security reviews for license applications referred from Commerce and State. The Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses, and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have identified issues with the existing licensing system, including overlapping regulations. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department oversees the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have raised concerns about the existing licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments for dual-use products, lengthy approval times, and outdated technology considerations. The licensing system for U.S. suppliers is criticized for lengthy approval times, lack of reflection of technological advances, and economic impact. Judicial review of licensing decisions is also lacking. Export administration officials claim thorough and fair reviews are conducted. Export administration officials conduct thorough, fair, and expeditious license reviews, checking proposed export items against controlled lists and investigating issues on a case-by-case basis to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some analysts question whether national security should be the primary focus of the export control regime. Some analysts question if the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) belongs in the Department of Commerce due to concerns about potential bias towards granting export licenses over national security goals. Some analysts argue that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) being in the Department of Commerce may lead to bias in granting export licenses, potentially conflicting with national security goals. However, others believe that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense ensures a fair and balanced decision-making process."
