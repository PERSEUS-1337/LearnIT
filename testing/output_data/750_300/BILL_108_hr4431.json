    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"One Church, One Child Act of 2004\". It includes findings. The Congress finds that many States are experiencing shortages of qualified foster and adoptive parents. A 2002 report highlighted a 68% increase in children in foster care from 1984 to 1995, while the number of foster parents decreased by 4%. Additionally, in 2001, only 50,000 children were adopted from foster care, leaving 126,000 children awaiting adoption. The shortage of adoptive parents is dire, with 126,000 children awaiting adoption in 2001. The increase in adoptions from foster care since 1997 has created a need for post-adoption services and skilled providers. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 has led to a growing need for post-adoption services and skilled providers. One Church, One Child is a national ministry established in 1980 to support at-risk children and adoptive families. One Church, One Child was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1980 by Father George Clements to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive families. The organization has successfully placed over 140,000 children in adoptive families nationwide. Despite its success, programs based on its model have received limited federal funding. The One Church, One Child program has been successful in providing recruitment, training, and support services for foster and adoptive parents.
