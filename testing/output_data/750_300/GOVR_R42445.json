    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts authorize spending on federal highway and mass transit programs, surface transportation safety and research, and some rail programs. The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extension acts and continuing resolutions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund has been the primary source of funding for surface transportation. The financial resources for surface transportation authorization bills have become more constrained since SAFETEA in 2005. The highway trust fund, funded by highway taxes, has seen declining revenues due to the economy and fuel efficiency improvements. Passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit is a key challenge. The HTF has declined due to the economy and fuel efficiency improvements, posing a challenge in passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other debated issues include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved given current revenue forecasts. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved. See CRS Report R41512 for more details. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, is a five-year bill with a total authorization of roughly $260 billion. The Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act (H.R. 7) is a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion. It includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing funding for mass transit with Highway Trust Fund revenues. The bill differs significantly from MAP-21 in programmatic content and treatment of the Highway Trust Fund. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill includes provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), and environmental streamlining provisions from Title III of H.R. 7. The Senate agreed to an amendment on April 24, 2012, that replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations are expected to involve the substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica has stated that negotiations for the surface transportation reauthorization will include the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. This process involves multiple committees marking up portions of the reauthorization bills before consolidation under a single bill number in each house. The pending reauthorization bills were marked up in seven different committees before consolidation under a single bill number in each house. The highway trust fund is primarily financed through excise taxes on motor fuels, with the highway account receiving an allocation from gasoline tax revenue. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. The HTF has two separate accounts for highway and mass transit, with the highway account receiving 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax and the mass transit account receiving 2.86 cents. Fuel tax rates have not been raised since 1993, leading to reduced revenues due to economic factors and improved vehicle fuel efficiency. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with rates last raised in 1993. Due to economic factors and improved vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel tax revenues have decreased below optimistic projections. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) required transfers from the general fund to pay states for completed work. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a $4.6 billion shortfall in the Highway account by the end of FY2013. The Congressional Budget Office projected a $4.6 billion shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund by the end of FY2013, with a projected gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall to a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014. A gap of $8-9 billion per year is projected through FY2022 for the mass transit account. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending. Policymakers face challenges in moving reauthorization legislation. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the fuel-based trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending. Policymakers must find new revenue sources or accept a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is primarily state-run and has maintained consistent financial and administrative attributes over the years. The Highway Program, administered by FHWA, is primarily state-run with state DOTs determining spending and complying with federal guidelines. Federally funded projects require a local matching share, typically 10% for Interstate System projects. The state DOTs oversee project development and construction, awarding contracts for federally funded highway projects that require a local matching share. The state/local match is 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA manages the Highway Program, distributing funds through apportionment and allocation. States do not receive federal money upfront for highway project spending. The FHWA notifies states of federal funds availability for highway projects. Funds are distributed through apportionment and allocation, with reimbursement after project approval and costs incurred. Contract authority allows for budget obligation. The reimbursable nature of the highway program helps prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority allows for budget obligation without an appropriation. Obligation of contract authority legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share of a project, even before an appropriation. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual FHWA spending. Contract authority for a project legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share, even before an appropriation. The ObLim sets a limit on annual FHWA spending, similar to an appropriation. Formula program funds are apportioned annually among states based on specific factors. The ObLim is similar to an appropriation and sets a limit on FHWA spending. There are formula and discretionary programs for federal-aid highway money allocation, with formula programs being apportioned annually among states based on specific factors. Formula programs receive the majority of SAFETEA's contract authority and fund most federal-aid highway projects. Approximately 80% of federal-aid highway money is allocated to state DOTs through core formula-driven programs, including the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Highway Bridge Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, and Equity Bonus Program. These programs fund most federal-aid highway projects as authorized by the legislation. The Highway Bridge Program (HBP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and Equity Bonus Program (EB) receive funds allocated through formula-driven programs. Each state's portion is determined by running the program's formula. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP. Some Highway Program funding can also be used for transit. The formula program for highway funding factors in policy intent and allows flexibility for fund transfers between programs, except for HSIP. Some funds can be used for transit projects, reducing the importance of funding formulas. State DOTs may feel restricted by programmatic structures in using federal highway funds. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds regardless of formulas. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of federal highway funds, diluting the policy rationales of core program formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program. During SAFETEA, Congress earmarked most funding for smaller discretionary highway programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, controlled by FHWA. The term \"program\" is broadly used, with FHWA listing 59 allocated programs, some programmatic and others resembling specific project designations or temporary pilot programs. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) administers the federal transit program, which consists of individual programs with varying funding amounts, distribution mechanisms, and spending eligibility rules. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) oversees various federal transit programs with different funding amounts, distribution mechanisms, and spending rules. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, making up 85% of authorized transit funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, accounting for 41% of funding, provides support to urban areas with populations of 50,000 or more for various expenses like capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA provides funding to urban areas with populations of 50,000 or more for various expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. New Starts Program and Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program are discretionary programs. New Starts funding is available for transit projects. The New Starts Program, part of SAFETEA, provides competitive funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including busways, ferries, and vintage trolleys. A \"Small Starts\" program was also enacted to fund projects under $250 million with a federal share of $75 million. The Small Starts program, part of SAFETEA, funds transit projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. It allocates $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization for projects such as busways, ferries, and vintage trolleys. Additionally, 9% of authorized funding goes towards the Bus Program for purchasing buses and related equipment, as well as building facilities like maintenance and transfer stations. The Bus Program receives 9% of authorized funding for purchasing buses, bus-related equipment, and building facilities like administrative and maintenance facilities, transfer facilities, bus shelters, and park-and-ride stations. Other smaller funding programs account for the remaining 15% of transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States, with states primarily responsible for highway safety. Federal highway safety programs established by Congress assist states in improving highway safety, administered by three DOT agencies authorized in SAFETEA. The Department of Transportation (DOT) agencies, including NHTSA, FMCSA, and FHWA, administer federal highway safety programs to improve driver behavior, vehicle safety, commercial driver qualifications, and roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to states to support traffic safety efforts. NHTSA provides grants to states to support traffic safety efforts, regulate motor vehicle safety, and oversee federal grant funds for highway safety plans. States must have approved plans to receive federal traffic safety funds, which identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures for progress evaluation. The NHTSA approves state plans to receive federal traffic safety funds, which must identify primary safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. Grants are provided through various programs to support state efforts in improving traffic safety. The Safety Program, also known as the Section 402 program, and other incentive grant programs support state efforts to improve traffic safety by addressing issues such as speeding, seat belt use, drunk driving, and distracted driving. FMCSA focuses on promoting commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and technical assistance. FMCSA promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and technical assistance. It administers safety grant programs to assist states in ensuring truck and motor coach operations' safety. HSIP aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving roadways, with funding allocated to states based on road lane-miles and vehicle usage. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) is a federal-aid program aimed at reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries by improving roadways. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. HSIP includes set-asides for the Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program and high-risk rural road construction and operational improvements. The SAFETEA extended mechanisms to guarantee annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects, protecting funds from being used elsewhere. It also ensured funding for the Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program and high-risk rural road improvements. SAFETEA established budget protections for highway and mass transit funds, ensuring annual funding levels and preventing lower appropriations through budget firewalls and House rules. The House rules in 2002 honored budget guarantees for highway and mass transit funds under SAFETEA, but these protections were eliminated in the 112th Congress. The RABA mechanism allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway receipts, potentially leading to either increased funding or cuts. Congress has never allowed a negative RABA calculation to result in funding cuts. The RABA mechanism adjusts funding levels based on annual highway receipts, potentially leading to increased funding or cuts. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels, Congress has never allowed funding cuts based on RABA calculations. The issue has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the HTF, but aligning spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization. In recent years, the RABA issue has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the HTF. However, aligning spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization, especially in light of the Budget Control Act's sequestration requirements. The Budget Control \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement on spending reductions, triggering exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Budget Control \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement on spending reductions, leading to exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending authorized beyond FY2012 due to exemptions for certain programs and activities. Sequestration exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety Operations, Transit Formula and Bus Grants. $739 million of annual contract authority may be subject to sequester, along with the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. SAFETEA expired in 2009. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program, supported by general fund revenues, is subject to sequester. Surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation since SAFETEA expired in 2009. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for the Highway Trust Fund and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012, with new legislative provisions included. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for the Highway Trust Fund and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012, with new legislative provisions included. The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21, enabling the measure to go to conference for negotiation. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica will be involved in the negotiations. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for the Highway Trust Fund and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012, with new legislative provisions included. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica has publicly stated that negotiation will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must fall within the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Members may raise issues of what is within the allowable scope for conference on H.R. 4348. Members may raise issues of what is within the allowable scope for conference on H.R. 4348, as conference reports containing provisions that are out of scope may be subject to points of order in both the House and Senate. Waiving points of order on the content of conference reports requires majority approval in the House and support of 60 Senators in the Senate. The Senate rules allow for waiving points of order on conference reports with the support of 60 Senators. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. The North American Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548) transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline from the Department of State to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It requires the commission to issue a permit within 30 days of enactment and deems the final environmental impact statement from 2011 as satisfying all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. This act also includes provisions similar to the RESTORE Act for the Gulf Coast States. The bill, enacted on August 26, 2011, establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by 80% of Deepwater Horizon-related penalties under the Clean Water Act. The Secretary of the Treasury administers the fund, distributing revenues with 35% going to Gulf Coast states. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund funded by Deepwater Horizon-related penalties under the Clean Water Act. The fund is administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with 35% going to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. The House-passed H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike the Senate-passed version. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4348 includes language similar to S. 1400, requiring budgetary resources to equal receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for harbor maintenance programs. Title V adds the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273) to the bill, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI includes the text of Title III of H.R. 7. Title V of the bill authorizes states to adopt coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI incorporates Title III of H.R. 7. Both House and Senate bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization funding the Federal-Aid Highway Program at baseline levels. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. It funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program at baseline levels, with a total authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013. The bill also includes $400 million for research and education in each fiscal year and eliminates all formula factors under individual formula programs. MAP-21 authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each year. It eliminates formula factors under individual programs, apportioning funds to states based on their share of total apportionments from FY2005-FY2009. This change ensures a 95% return on each state's payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The MAP-21 legislation authorizes funding for transportation projects, with a focus on ensuring a 95% return on each state's payments to the Highway Trust Fund. This new approach replaces individual program formulas with a calculation based on SAFETEA share, reducing congressional influence on project selection. The shift towards broad eligibility across programs aims to align national interests with federal planning efforts. MAP-21 eliminates congressional influence on project selection by removing program formulas and earmarking. National interests will be driven by federal planning and project eligibility requirements. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. The number of programs will be reduced by two-thirds, mainly by shifting eligibility to core programs and eliminating discretionary grant programs under FHWA control. MAP-21 would reduce the number of programs by two-thirds, mainly by shifting program eligibility to core programs and eliminating discretionary grant programs under FHWA control. The Transportation Enhancements Program (TE) would be rolled into the CMAQ program, with some controversial TE uses eliminated. States could use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance for one and a half years. Some TE-type projects would also be eligible for funding in other proposed programs, including the National Freight Program (NFP) to increase funding for freight projects. The Senate bill allows states to spend TE funds on non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance for one and a half years. Some TE-type projects are eligible for funding in other proposed programs, including the National Freight Program (NFP). The bill increases TIFIA program funding nearly ten-fold but is silent on tolling of federally funded roads and bridges. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a five-year reauthorization with modest increases in federal-aid highways funding and $440 million annually for research and education. It includes folding the Interstate Maintenance and Highway Bridge programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs. The bill is silent on tolling of federally funded roads and bridges, which are important for revenue streams needed for projects like TIFIA. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a five-year reauthorization with modest increases in federal-aid highways funding, folding existing programs into new ones, retaining certain programs, reducing the number of distinct programs, and renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account. The Equity Bonus program in the House bill would guarantee a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The Mass Transit Account of the HTF would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing $2.267 billion annually for highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account, and provisions under the streamlining title would change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. The House bill would redirect fuel taxes from the Mass Transit Account to the Highway Account and change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold, while MAP-21 provisions would fund the Federal Transit Administration at the current level. MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2013 for transit programs, creation of the State of Good Repair program, and elimination of the Bus and Bus Facilities program. Funding would come from the Highway Trust Fund and the general fund. The Bus and Bus Facilities program would be eliminated, with funding redirected to competitive grants for bus upkeep. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account and modifying the New Starts process. Funding of $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2016 would be authorized. H.R. 7 authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. Provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account, redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account, and transferring $40 billion from the general fund to fund the ATA. Clean Fuels Grant Program, Transit in Parks Program, and Growing and High Density State Formula would be eliminated. New Freedom Program, Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Program, and Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program would be combined. Funding for Bus and Bus-related Facilities Program would be distributed differently. MAP-21 combines the New Freedom Program, Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Program, and Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program. It also includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control. Amendments are made to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program for freight rail. The bill includes provisions for the development of a rolling stock equipment pool for intercity passenger services and positive train control implementation. It also amends the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program for freight rail to accept state or local subsidies as collateral. Additionally, there are modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The House bill addresses Amtrak funding, RRIF program, and positive train control implementation. The House bill includes provisions for Amtrak funding, the RRIF program, and positive train control implementation. The finance title of the Senate bill extends highway-related taxes and trust fund expenditure authority. It aims to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, with $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years, including $9.279 billion to be transferred in FY2012-FY2013. The bill extends highway trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013, raising $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. Funds include transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, and Treasury levies. Over the next 10 years, funding sources for the Highway Trust Fund include $697 million from the Gas Guzzler Tax transfer, $743 million from passport revocations for tax delinquents, $841 million from Treasury levies on Medicare providers, $4.52 billion from future import tariffs on automotive products, $244 million from tax treatment changes for controlled corporations, and $25 million from IRS levies. Over 10 years, funding sources include $244 million from tax treatment changes for controlled corporations, $25 million from IRS levies, $363 million from pension asset transfers, and $9.467 billion from pension funding stabilization. The curr_chunk discusses various funding sources, including $9.467 billion from pension funding stabilization, $4.970 billion transfer from the Treasury general fund to the HTF, $459 million from phased retirement, $244 million from the sale of life insurance policies, and $99 million from federal agencies offering phased retirement. The curr_chunk outlines various revenue provisions, including funds from pension stabilization, Treasury fund transfers, phased retirement, sale of life insurance policies, cigarette taxes, interest expense delay, and measures against money laundering, totaling billions over 10 years. The curr_chunk discusses interest expense allocation, special measures against money laundering, and changes to the Small Issuer Exception, totaling billions over 10 years. These provisions have raised comments regarding deficit reduction or increased spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception and modifications to bonds issued before January 1, 2013, resulting in savings of millions over 10 years. The Finance Committee reported on provisions that saved money, including changes to bonds issued before January 1, 2013, and extending benefits for employer-provided vanpool and transit pass. The Senate bill also included a provision for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks. The Senate bill includes a provision for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks, as well as a modified version of the Transportation Access for All Americans Act. This modified version would change the depreciation period for long-term highway leases from 15 to 45 years, potentially making highway privatization less attractive to private-sector investors. The bill proposes changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases from 15 to 45 years, which may deter private-sector investors from highway privatization. It also ensures that the amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls is not less than the lease term or 15 years, whichever is greater. The Finance Committee is concerned that the current law's 15-year amortization period for toll collection rights is often shorter than the lease term. The Finance Committee proposes changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases from 15 to 45 years to deter private-sector investors. It also ensures that the amortization period for toll collection rights is not less than the lease term or 15 years, whichever is greater. The bill includes a provision for a \"solvency account\" to transfer excess amounts appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund before October 1, 2013, for future needs. The Secretary of the Treasury would transfer excess amounts appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund before October 1, 2013, to ensure each account maintains a financial cushion of $2.8 billion. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund, established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund, established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks, as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund. The LUST trust fund receives revenues from a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels to support environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. The LUST trust fund appropriations support environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. States use the funds to oversee corrective actions by responsible parties and conduct actions in emergencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities and allowed the use of trust fund money for federal UST leak prevention and detection. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities for UST leak prevention and detection. Over 85% of the 501,000 reported releases from leaking petroleum tanks have been addressed, leaving 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The LUST trust fund had a $3.392 billion unobligated balance at the beginning of FY2012. In FY2012, 85% of the 501,000 reported releases from leaking petroleum tanks have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion at the beginning of FY2012. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million from the trust fund for several fiscal years, with states receiving a minimum of 80% of the annual appropriation as grants. EPA uses the remainder to carry out its responsibilities, including implementing the program on Indian lands. Section 40301 of the Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Section 40302 suggests appropriating one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax to the highway trust fund. States' LUST programs have historically relied on nonfederal fund sources due to low appropriations. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. It also suggests appropriating one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax to the highway trust fund, with projected transfers totaling $3.685 billion over ten years. Additionally, the bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. The bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013. H.R. 7 includes provisions reauthorizing HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extending existing highway taxes through FY2018. H.R. 7 reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extends existing highway taxes through FY2018. The bill includes provisions to ensure that all future transfers from the general fund to the HTF are fully offset. It aims to fill gaps in revenue increases or offsets, including a $40 billion gap. H.R. 7 reconfigures the highway trust fund by filling two revenue gaps. One is the difference between highway revenues and authorized levels, and the other is $40 billion for an alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016, without allocating balances to the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 7 extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016, without allocating balances to the Highway Trust Fund. It directs federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions to be incorporated into H.R. 7, which extends the LUST trust fund without allocating balances to the Highway Trust Fund. Revenues from energy leasing and drilling activities will be directed into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, allowing the Department of the Interior to lease oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas for upfront payments, rentals, and royalties. The Department of the Interior leases rights for offshore oil and gas development in federal ocean areas for upfront payments, rentals, and royalties. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion in FY2011. Current law allocates receipts to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund receive annual allocations from federal receipts, with additional funds going to Gulf Coast states. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. It transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and includes Title XVI for offsetting revenues. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013. The bill eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA, with a 95 cent return on each dollar paid by highway users. Highway program earmarks are not included in MAP-21. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA, with a 95 cent return on each dollar paid by highway users. The bill does not include highway program earmarks and includes a provision called the \"ratchet mechanism\" to ensure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. The DOT and Department of the Treasury must estimate if the highway account balance will drop below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013 within 60 days of enactment. If so, adjustments will be made to prevent this, with withdrawn funds lapsing and contract authority rescinded. Similar calculations will be made for subsequent years, but only under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term resolutions. The provision requires the DOT and Department of the Treasury to estimate if the highway account balance will drop below certain thresholds in FY2012 and FY2013. If so, adjustments will be made to prevent this, with funds lapsing and contract authority rescinded. This is related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels, committing the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keep spending within HTF means and potentially increasing pressure to identify additional revenue options. The ratchet mechanism may be implemented if trigger HTF balances are reached. H.R. 7 proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion. Congress may face resistance in implementing the ratchet mechanism if trigger HTF balances are breached, as seen in the negative RABA calculation for FY2003. Despite the negative RABA calculation, Congress overrode reductions by drawing down the positive balance in the HTF. H.R. 7 proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years. The bill includes HTF obligation limitations for FY2013-FY2016, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account. Congress overrode reductions by drawing down the positive balance in the HTF despite a negative RABA calculation. H.R. 7 proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account. The bill includes obligation limitations for FY2013-FY2016 and a modified Equity Bonus Program with a guarantee for state highway grants. The House bill proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account. It includes an Equity Bonus Program guaranteeing each state's total highway grants to equal at least 94% of motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF, capped at $3.9 billion per year. The bill also funds various highway programs and allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system. The House bill proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with expanded tolling of the Interstate system. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and allows for projects to add lanes and convert highways to toll facilities. MAP-21 does not set core programs' authorization levels and funding runs through individual program formulas. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and proposes a federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years. Unlike previous authorization acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. The initial amount for each state is determined by multiplying the total available funds by each state's share of nationwide apportionments and allocations for FY2005-FY2009. Adjustments are made to ensure each state receives at least 95% of estimated tax payments from highway users. Adjustments may not be necessary due to federal highway spending exceeding revenues for FY2005-FY2009. The initial amount for each state is determined based on nationwide apportionments and allocations for FY2005-FY2009, with adjustments made to ensure states receive at least 95% of estimated tax payments from highway users. If MAP-21 is enacted and fully funded, adjustments may not be necessary due to federal highway spending exceeding revenues. Additionally, a portion of funds is set aside for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The initial amount for each state is determined based on nationwide apportionments and allocations for FY2005-FY2009, with adjustments made to ensure states receive at least 95% of estimated tax payments from highway users. A portion of funds is set aside for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The metropolitan planning amount is determined by multiplying the ratio of a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009 to its total apportionments for that year, times the adjusted initial amount calculated in the first two steps. The remaining amount of each state's \"initial amount\" is divided among the four core programs: 58% for the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), 29.3% for the Transportation Mobility Program (TMP), 7% for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and 5.7% for the National. The initial amount for each state is divided among core programs: 58% for NHPP, 29.3% for TMP, 7% for HSIP, and 5.7% for NFP. State apportionments may be adjusted based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. The provision applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized. State apportionments would be reduced based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways, with the reduced amounts then distributed among other states. FHWA estimates this would impact Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado. The provision applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized, impacting Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado. Apportionments for these states would be reduced based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled, with the reduced amounts then distributed among other states. This adjustment would decrease apportionments for Illinois by 0.087%, Indiana by 4.375%, and Colorado by 0.045%, while increasing apportionments for all other states by 0.115%. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program. Instead, it determines the initial amount for each state based on their share of total funding from FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue upfront. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program. Instead, it determines the initial amount for each state based on their share of total funding from FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue upfront. The adjustment mechanism ensures all states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF, with a nationwide rate of return for FY2005-FY2009 at $1.23 on the dollar. This base level would likely lift all donor states above the 95% level, but if Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary. The nationwide rate of return for FY2005-FY2009 was $1.23 on the dollar, which could lift all donor states above the 95% level. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary to guarantee a 95% return. Some states may prefer using the state return on payments to the HTF to determine the initial amount, rather than the state share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding, due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA included 6,372 earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of funding for highway earmarks. SAFETEA included 6,372 earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of funding for highway earmarks being \"below the line,\" reducing state Equity Bonus distributions. The remaining 33% of earmark funding was \"above the line,\" increasing funds to receiving states. Under MAP-21, project earmarks were eliminated, but states that previously received \"above the line\" earmarks benefited from higher base amounts. The apportionment calculation is based on state shares of funding from SAFETEA years, resulting in some states receiving more funding. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks, but states that received \"above the line\" earmarks under SAFETEA benefited from higher base amounts in the apportionment calculation. This could continue to favor states that did well during the SAFETEA earmarking process. MAP-21 reduced funding programs by two-thirds to around 30 programs, absorbing their eligibilities into new core programs. The core programs have overlapping eligibility areas and are authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The core programs under MAP-21 would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System. The NHPP program would receive $21 billion for FY2013 to support the improvement of the National Highway System, combining three core programs to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure condition, safety, and mobility. This includes projects for highway segments, bridges, tunnels, and ferry facilities. The NHPP program, funded with $21 billion for FY2013, focuses on improving the National Highway System through projects such as highway segments, bridges, tunnels, and ferry facilities. It also includes investments in bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States are limited to spending no more than 40% of their three-year NHPP apportionment on the program. The NHPP program focuses on improving the National Highway System through various projects, including highway segments, bridges, tunnels, and ferry facilities. States are limited to spending 40% of their three-year NHPP apportionment on new capacity. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds may be transferred from other programs if bridge conditions fall below the minimum set by the Secretary of Transportation. This program aims to assist states and localities in improving infrastructure conditions. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) aims to improve the conditions and performance of federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads by transferring funds from other programs if bridge conditions fall below the minimum set by the Secretary of Transportation. It replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, excluding the Transportation Enhancement set-aside. The TMP authorization is approximately $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) authorizes roughly $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects such as transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. It replaces SAFETEA programs and includes eligibility for state participation in transportation enhancements. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects including recreational trails, ferry facilities, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking facilities, safe routes to school projects, and natural habitat/wetlands mitigation efforts. Additionally, funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads within 10 miles of international borders. TMP funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads within 10 miles of international borders. States could face penalties if deficient bridges increase. Funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution. TMP funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution, with 50% allocated to specific areas and the remaining 50% available for any area in the state. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be replaced by TMP, giving states more flexibility in spending. CMAQ would be expanded under SAFETEA. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated under TMP, giving states more flexibility in spending. CMAQ would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects and receive roughly $3.3 billion annually under MAP-21. Under MAP-21, CMAQ funding would increase to $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with eligibility expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. HSIP funding would remain at $2.5 billion annually to support safety improvements on road infrastructure. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and the Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished under MAP-21, with their project eligibilities retained. A new program called the National Freight Program (NFP) would be introduced to improve the condition and performance of a designated national freight network, funded at roughly $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The National Freight Program (NFP) under MAP-21 aims to enhance the newly designated national freight network with approximately $2 billion in annual funding for FY2012 and FY2013. The program includes restrictions on transferring funds between apportioned programs, with a reduction from 50% to 20% in the maximum percentage allowed for transfers. Section 1507 of the bill prohibits the transfer of TMP funding suballocated by population. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining more of the existing core program structure but expanding the National Highway System Program (NHS) and the Surface Transportation Program (STP). The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the National Highway System. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 would consolidate and expand the National Highway System Program (NHS) and the Surface Transportation Program (STP) to include the Highway Bridge Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be integrated into the National Highway System, while the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The 10% set-aside for Transportation Enhancements would be eliminated, with many absorbed or eliminated programs still eligible under different programs. The obligation limitations for core highway programs under H.R. 7 total $150.7 billion for FY2013-FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the CMAQ program. H.R. 7 expands funding for the NHS program to help pay for highway improvements. H.R. 7, the largest formula program in the bill, would allocate $70.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016 to expand funding for the National Highway System (NHS) program. This funding would support maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Only projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, and states would need to align projects with national performance goals. H.R. 7 would allocate $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the Surface Transportation Program (STP), focusing on the construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels on the National Highway System (NHS). States must align projects with national performance goals and develop state asset management plans for the NHS. H.R. 7 authorizes $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the Surface Transportation Program (STP), broadening its purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill eliminates the 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement purposes and prohibits projects on local or rural minor collector roads unless they were on the federal-aid highway system in 1991. H.R. 7 eliminates the 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement purposes and prohibits projects on local or rural minor collector roads unless they were on the federal-aid highway system in 1991. It allows up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on minor collectors. The bill reduces the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local or rural planning organizations before obligating funds for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, requiring states to have their own highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds. Plans must be developed in consultation with stakeholders, set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress on the 100 most dangerous roads in the state. H.R. 7 would provide $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for safety plans to receive HSIP funds. Plans must be developed in consultation with stakeholders, set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress on the 100 most dangerous roads in the state. Federal cost share would remain at 90%. H.R. 7 proposes amendments to the CMAQ program, guaranteeing each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway taxes. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, limiting the amount for the guarantee to $3.9 billion annually. Under SAFETEA, the EB authorization was for \"such sums as necessary.\" The STP authorization under H.R. 7 guarantees each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway taxes, with $15.6 billion authorized over FY2013-FY2014. The annual limit for the guarantee is $3.9 billion. If this amount is insufficient to bring all states up to 94%, the STP authorization would be decreased to provide additional funds. The Senate bill, Section 1107, clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Section 1107 of the Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds related to roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. It specifies that closed roads or those already scheduled for construction are not eligible, limits U.S. territories to $20 million per fiscal year, and removes the $100 million ceiling for disasters in a single state. Section 1506 of H.R. 7 adjusts the emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs and allows for 100% federal share if repair costs exceed the state apportionment. The $100 million ceiling for disasters in a single state is eliminated. The Secretary of Transportation may allow a 100% federal share for repair costs exceeding the state apportionment under H.R. 7, Section 1111. \"Comparable facility\" is defined as meeting current standards for traffic volume. Debris removal costs are reimbursed if not covered by the Stafford Act, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million annually. An emergency declaration by the governor or President is required. The Senate bill, Section 1116, would restructure the Federal Lands Highways Programs by creating the Federal Lands and Tribal Roads. Assistance for debris removal costs would be limited to expenses not covered by the Stafford Act, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million per year. Emergency declaration by the governor or President is necessary for assistance. The Senate bill, Section 1116, proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program. This new program includes the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program, with proposed annual funding of $450 million for tribal transportation and $550 million for other federal lands programs. MAP-21 proposes to fund the Tribal Transportation Program at $450 million annually and other federal lands programs at $550 million annually. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for distributing funds based on road mileage and tribal population. The Federal Lands Access Program funding would be allocated among states based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Tribal Transportation Program and Federal Lands Transportation program are authorized at $465 million and $535 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with a set-aside of $45 million annually for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico would receive 75% of the funding. The Senate bill authorizes the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico receives a 75% set-aside, while Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands receive a 25% set-aside. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually from the alternative transportation account for FY2013-FY2016. The Territorial Highway Program is also retained at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill eliminates the ADHS program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 would raise the federal share payable for the cost of constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 retains the Appalachian Development Highway System program at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. States can use toll credits for the local matching share, and funds are apportioned based on cost estimates with no state receiving less than 1% or more than 25%. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a program similar to SAFETEA for high-cost transportation projects. $1 billion budget authority is provided for FY2013, requiring an appropriation before funds are available. States can use toll credits for matching share, with funds apportioned based on cost estimates. The Senate bill establishes a program for high-cost transportation projects with a $1 billion budget authority for FY2013. The program aims to fund critical infrastructure projects that would provide economic benefits, increase competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve energy security, freight movement, and transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office is required to report on the selection process within three years of enactment. The Senate bill creates a program for high-cost transportation projects with a $1 billion budget authority for FY2013 to fund critical infrastructure projects. The Government Accountability Office will report on the selection process within three years of enactment. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would establish a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distributed based on a formula. A general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities is proposed, with funding distribution based on a formula: 20% on total passengers, 50% on vehicles carried per day, and 30% on total route miles serviced. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013. The proposed funding for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities is based on a formula considering total passengers, vehicles carried per day, and total route miles serviced. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013, with additional funds available through the proposed Alternative Transportation Account under H.R. 7. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) would modify the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program under 23 U.S.C. 147, funding it at $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016 via the Alternative Transportation Account. Distribution of funds would be based on vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) proposes funding the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. Funding distribution is based on vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would also be eligible for formula funds under the program. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects, with loans repaid through project-related user fees. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including authorizing $1 billion to greatly enlarge the program. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund to greatly enlarge the program. This would cover administrative and subsidy costs, allowing for loans totaling $9.9 billion per year. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, authorizing $1 billion annually to cover administrative and subsidy costs. This would allow for loans totaling $9.9 billion per year, with the potential for increased project cost coverage and the introduction of a master credit agreement system. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including allowing credit assistance for projects secured by a master credit agreement. This change aims to accelerate financing for transit projects like the 30/10 Initiative by organizations such as the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The proposed threshold for eligible projects is $25 million for rural infrastructure projects. MAP-21 proposes changes to TIFIA, including a $25 million threshold for rural infrastructure projects. Rural projects can get loans at half the Treasury rate, unlike urban projects. The TIFIA program in MAP-21 includes provisions for rural infrastructure projects, offering loans at half the Treasury rate and setting aside 10% of funds for such projects. Evaluation criteria for projects would be eliminated, with funding allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. The TIFIA program in MAP-21 would abolish evaluation criteria and allocate funding on a first-come, first-served basis. Projects could enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance or pay their own credit subsidy. Funding not used may be apportioned to states for the Transportation Mobility Program. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. The bill also establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance and eliminates evaluation criteria, providing assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. H.R. 7 establishes master credit agreements for TIFIA assistance, removes evaluation criteria, and provides assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. It maintains thresholds for non-ITS and ITS projects, adds thresholds for rural projects and assistance under a master credit agreement. The bill also increases federal assistance to 49% and proposes to authorize $750 million per year. H.R. 7 proposes to raise the maximum federal assistance to 49% and authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. It also includes thresholds for rural projects and assistance under a master credit agreement. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, only a collection of freight-related programs within the larger surface transportation program. SAFETEA does not have a separate federal freight transportation program but includes various freight-related programs within the larger surface transportation program. Most of the funding for freight improvements is provided to states through programs like the Surface Transportation Program, with minor funding specifically dedicated to freight transportation. State DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations have the authority to prioritize freight projects. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) does not have a similar program but includes provisions that impact freight transportation. This marks a significant departure from SAFETEA, which leaves most decisions about freight priority to state DOTs and planning organizations. The debate on whether the federal government should focus more on funding freight improvements has been ongoing. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) includes provisions that impact freight transportation. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare a national freight transport plan and seek to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new core program to prioritize infrastructure critical for freight movement, known as the \"primary freight network\" (PFN), consisting of 27,000 centerline miles. This program aims to enhance private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements. The Senate bill proposes a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles to prioritize infrastructure critical for freight movement. States would be guided to spend their freight program apportionment on the PFN first before other freight-related infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could designate up to an additional 3,000 centerline miles as part of the PFN. States would prioritize spending their freight program funds on the Primary Freight Network (PFN) before other freight-related infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could designate up to 3,000 additional centerline miles as part of the PFN based on future importance to freight movement. States could designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" connecting the PFN or Interstate System with busy freight terminals. States could spend a maximum of 20% of their freight program funds on this. States could designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting the PFN or Interstate System with busy freight terminals. They can spend up to 20% of their freight program funds on these roads, which are part of the national freight network (NFM). Funds can also be used on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows on nearby interstates more cost-effectively. States can spend up to 10% of their freight program funds on public or private freight rail or maritime projects if it improves freight flow significantly and provides a better return than a highway project on the PFN. This funding program aims to enhance freight movement efficiently. The project selection process prioritizes freight flow improvement, public benefit exceeding costs, and higher returns than highway projects on the PFN. A specific funding program for freight movement and performance measures development by states will enhance consideration of freight needs. The PFN designation focuses funds on critical highway segments for freight movement, with congestion affecting truck travel speeds on over 4,700 miles of highways. The Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to prioritize funding for critical highway segments essential for freight movement, particularly in urban interchanges where congestion affects truck travel speeds. Despite potential reluctance from states to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks, programs like TIFIA and Projects of National and Regional Significance could provide support. The freight program under consideration would rely on apportioned funds, with states possibly hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that mainly benefit trucks. Programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ may be better suited for funding these projects. The Senate bill does not change truck size and weight limits but requires a study on possible changes. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs rather than creating a separate freight program. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs rather than creating a separate freight program. It also seeks greater reliance on tolling to finance highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases for revenue. The House bill, H.R. 7, aims to increase truck weight limits and trailer lengths for LTL carriers, potentially benefiting truck transportation. Trucking organizations oppose the bill's reliance on tolling for highway construction funding, preferring fuel tax increases instead. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved an amendment for a DOT study on increasing truck weight limits, but not the proposed increase to 97,000 pounds with a sixth axle. The House bill, H.R. 7, includes provisions for increasing trailer lengths and truck weights. The bill allows for double trailers to be 33 feet long, truckload carriers to use 53-foot trailers, and auto transporters to use 80-foot trailers. Additionally, a pilot program will permit certain states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on specific Interstate Highway segments for four years. The committee report mentions coal transport in West Virginia and timber trucking in Minnesota as participants in this pilot program. The pilot program allows up to three states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on 25-mile Interstate Highway segments. Participants include coal transport in West Virginia and timber trucking in Minnesota. A weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was increased to 550 pounds. MAP-21 would bring significant changes to transportation planning requirements at various levels, with a focus on performance management. For freight provisions related to rail and maritime modes, refer to the \"Rail Provisions\" and \"Harbor Maintenance Expenditures\" sections of the report. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to transportation planning requirements, emphasizing performance management at national, state, and local levels. It includes a requirement for the use of performance management throughout the planning process, with state and metropolitan planning organizations developing specific performance measures and targets. The bill sets five national goals but allows states and MPOs to set their own performance targets. The bill includes national goals but allows states and MPOs to set their own performance measures and targets. Failure to meet targets results in a remedial plan of action. The National Freight Program requires a national freight strategic plan with quantifiable performance measures. The MAP-21 bill mandates the development of a national freight strategic plan with performance measures for the primary freight network. States must set performance targets, and failure to meet them requires a remedial plan. The MAP-21 bill requires states to set performance targets for the primary freight network. Failure to meet these targets would necessitate submitting a freight performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, provisions in the Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act outline the establishment of a national surface transportation and freight policy and the development of a strategic plan, sometimes overlapping with provisions in other sections. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national strategic freight plan and a national surface transportation plan. Some provisions overlap or conflict with those in other sections, such as setting goals for reducing traffic fatalities and developing strategic freight plans within specific timeframes. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act aims to reduce motor vehicle-related and truck-related fatalities by 50% by 2030. Conflicting provisions include the development of a national strategic freight plan within three years and a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within two years of enactment. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies under the National Highway Performance Program. States failing to meet targets must outline actions to achieve them. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act requires states to develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies. States failing to meet targets must outline actions to achieve them, including setting minimum standards for pavement and bridges. Non-compliance could result in redirecting federal funds to address infrastructure deficiencies. MAP-21 would require states to incorporate metropolitan transportation plans and programs into their statewide transportation plans and improvement programs. This is a change from the current requirement of only developing statewide plans in cooperation with the MPO. Statewide plans and improvement programs under Section 1202 of MAP-21 must now include metropolitan transportation plans and programs without alteration. States are also required to collaborate with nonmetropolitan areas in developing their plans, moving beyond mere consultation. A performance-based approach, including coordinated performance measures and targets with other planning efforts like the national freight strategic plan, is mandated in transportation planning. MAP-21's planning provisions require states to incorporate a performance-based approach into transportation planning, including coordination with national freight strategic plan. Metropolitan transportation planning would involve creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, each with specific technical requirements. MAP-21 establishes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Each tier must meet minimum technical requirements related to modeling, data, staffing, and planning elements. Tier I MPOs will have performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II requirements will be more discretionary. Regulations for these requirements must be issued by the Secretary within one year of enactment. The MAP-21 establishes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Tier I MPOs will have performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II requirements will be more discretionary. The Secretary may include performance measures for Tier II MPOs, and there are provisions for optional blueprint planning. Both tiers can select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states and facility owners. MAP-21 introduces changes to the metropolitan planning provisions by requiring MPOs to be designated only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, up from the current requirement of 50,000 or more. MPOs in areas below 200,000 population can be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements set by the Secretary for Tier II MPOs. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population need reaffirmation by the MPO and governor to be approved. The MAP-21 legislation requires MPOs to be designated only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population must be reaffirmed by the MPO and governor to continue. The legislation allows for the consolidation of metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but more than one MPO can co-exist if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. H.R. 7 proposes allowing multiple MPOs to co-exist in an area if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. It also includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the DOT. The plan would include projects of national and regional significance, cost estimates, and be updated every two years. The national strategic transportation plan by DOT would require states to submit projects of national and regional significance for inclusion in the plan. It includes cost estimates and must be updated every two years. H.R. 7 also mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems, with state reporting requirements. H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems, including state reporting requirements. States must report annually on their progress towards meeting performance targets, and identify projects of national, regional, and statewide significance in the long-range transportation plan. The bill also includes measures to address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. H.R. 7 mandates the consideration of intercity buses in reducing congestion and pollution, as well as improving the existing bus system. It also involves regional transportation planning organizations in project selection for areas without a designated MPO. H.R. 7 aims to enhance the intercity bus system, involving regional transportation planning organizations in project selection. It proposes raising the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000 and requires consideration of intercity buses in metropolitan planning. Existing MPOs in areas under 100,000 population can remain designated unless the governor and localities agree to end it. H.R. 7 also includes a requirement for metropolitan planning to factor in intercity buses. Concerns about efficient resource use in transportation projects have grown due to budgetary pressures. The speed of project delivery and the federal government's role in the process have been highlighted. The federal government's role in project delivery, specifically in expediting the environmental review process for highway and transit projects, is a key focus in both House and Senate proposals. This process involves activities starting in the planning stage and concluding in the engineering and design stage, requiring documentation and analysis to demonstrate compliance. Transit projects involve activities from planning to engineering stages, focusing on identifying and addressing project-related impacts on the environment. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is essential to meet environmental standards. Various environmental requirements may apply to transportation projects, including obtaining necessary permits and mitigating project effects on historic sites or parks. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is crucial for meeting environmental standards. The U.S. Coast Guard is involved in a bridge reconstruction project, activities are determined to mitigate effects on historic sites, parks, and wildlife refuges. Documentation and analysis are required for federal-aid highway or transit projects under NEPA before final design activities can proceed. The U.S. Coast Guard is involved in a bridge reconstruction project, activities are determined to mitigate effects on historic sites, parks, and wildlife refuges. Documentation and analysis are required for federal-aid highway or transit projects under NEPA before final design activities can proceed. Federal agencies must identify and consider environmental impacts before project approval. Compliance with environmental requirements must be reflected in NEPA documentation. Recent legislative efforts aimed at expediting environmental reviews have focused on NEPA compliance for major highway and transit projects. Compliance with environmental requirements must be reflected in NEPA documentation, but the distinction between NEPA requirements and those identified during the compliance process can impact project delays and potential solutions for streamlining the environmental review process. Recent legislative efforts under SAFETEA and TEA-21 focused on expediting environmental reviews for major highway and transit projects, primarily addressing NEPA compliance. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 also aim to expedite project delivery by modifying environmental compliance requirements, with the House proposal suggesting more sweeping changes than MAP-21. Various factors will influence the impact of these proposed changes. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to expedite project delivery by modifying environmental compliance requirements. Factors will affect how these changes may accelerate environmental reviews and project delivery, potentially slowing down the process by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements. The provisions in MAP-21 apply to the environmental review phase of transportation project development. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development, where state, tribal, and federal environmental compliance requirements, including those under NEPA, are identified and documented. Compliance may involve coordination with federal, state, or tribal agencies before final project activities. Before final design activities, property acquisition, purchase of construction materials, or project construction can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure that the environmental review process for the project is complete. This process, under NEPA, includes preparing an environmental impact statement if the project may significantly affect the environment. If the significance of the project's environmental impacts is unclear, an environmental assessment (EA) must be conducted to determine the impact. Projects that may significantly affect the environment must include an environmental impact statement. If the impacts are unclear, an environmental assessment is conducted. Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from the requirement for an EIS or EA. DOT's NEPA regulations outline two groups of actions that are generally considered categorical exclusions. About 90% of highway projects approved since 1998 fall under this category. Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA since 1998 are processed as categorical exclusions (CEs) under DOT's NEPA regulations. These projects have no significant environmental impact under NEPA but may still be subject to other environmental requirements. The most significant changes to the environmental review process in MAP-21 would be established under this framework. The environmental review process in MAP-21 includes changes under Section 1313 for \"Accelerated Decisionmaking\" and Section 1316 for \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" These changes aim to establish new requirements for issue resolution to ensure all parties meet project deadlines and resolve disputes that may cause delays. The provisions in Section 1313 of MAP-21 aim to establish criteria for issue resolution in the environmental review process to ensure timely completion and resolution of disputes. It also includes financial transfer provisions for agencies that fail to issue or deny required approvals, with penalties of $10,000 or $20,000 under certain conditions. The financial transfer provisions in Section 1313 of MAP-21 require an agency to transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly if they fail to issue or deny a required permit, license, or approval within 180 days of application completion or final project decision. Transfer is not required if the delay is not the agency's fault. The transfer of funds is required if an agency fails to issue or deny a permit, license, or approval within 180 days of application completion or final project decision. The responsible agencies for DOT projects may include EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Divisional, regional, or local offices within these agencies process permit applications for various regulated activities. The agencies responsible for DOT projects process permit applications for various regulated activities, including private land development, mining operations, oil and gas development, and cattle grazing. Agency under-staffing or lack of funds can cause delays in issuing necessary approvals or permits, and redirecting limited agency funds to expedite a single transportation project approval may slow down other applications being processed. MAP-21 requires DOT to prepare assessments under Section 1316. Under Section 1316, MAP-21 mandates DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments for transportation projects initiated before and after 2005. DOT must report this data to Congress within a year of MAP-21's enactment. The DOT is required under MAP-21 to compare completion times of environmental assessments for transportation projects initiated before and after 2005. The agency must report this information to Congress within a year of MAP-21's enactment. Little or no data is available for projects processed with EAs. The DOT is required to compare completion times of environmental assessments for transportation projects before and after 2005 under Section 1316. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and State DOTs do not track the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. Extracting accurate information about NEPA process activities may be challenging. NEPA compliance is part of the project delivery process, with DOT possibly requiring states to track and report time taken for NEPA activities. MAP-21 provisions for CEs involve changing regulatory requirements, including \"Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions\" (Section 1310). MAP-21 provisions for CEs involve directives to DOT to change existing regulatory requirements for such projects. The key provision, \"Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions\" (Section 1310), would require DOT to survey state agencies for new CE suggestions and add them to the regulatory list. Additionally, DOT would move certain projects from requiring approval to not needing DOT approval. The curr_chunk discusses changes to CE regulations, including moving projects from requiring approval to not needing DOT approval and specifying agency roles for NEPA compliance. It also mentions criteria for designating projects within highway right-of-way as categorical exclusions. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for designating projects within highway right-of-way as categorical exclusions and continuing environment-related programs under SAFETEA, including assistance to affected state and federal agencies. The curr_chunk discusses using transportation funds for dedicated staff at a federal agency to expedite project planning. States can also use funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The curr_chunk discusses allowing states to use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities under a new program that would make the surface transportation project delivery pilot program permanent. Under a new program, states could use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The program would make the surface transportation project delivery pilot program permanent. The program would require DOT to make determinations on a state's ability to implement it. Provisions in the House bill focus on environmental review processes under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining,\" which amends federal-aid highways requirements. The House bill includes provisions under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining,\" and Subtitle C, \"Project Development and Review,\" which would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, excluding projects costing less than $10 million or with minimal federal funding. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, excluding those costing less than $10 million or with minimal federal funding. It would alter the NEPA compliance process by changing project alternatives, document formats, analysis requirements, and evaluation levels for cumulative project impacts. Agencies outside DOT would also need to comply with these changes. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, excluding those costing less than $10 million or with minimal federal funding. It would alter the NEPA compliance process by changing project alternatives, document formats, analysis requirements, and evaluation levels for cumulative project impacts. Additionally, agencies outside DOT would need to adhere to specific timeframes for permits or approvals, establish a 270-day deadline for the environmental review process, and amend requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The House proposal aims to amend NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, setting limits on judicial review and legal sufficiency standards for environmental documents. It includes provisions for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. This inclusion ensures that the House streamlining provisions will not be challenged. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, ensuring that the House streamlining provisions will not be challenged. MAP-21 would make three main changes to existing law to speed project delivery, including adding authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. MAP-21 would make three main changes to existing law in an attempt to speed project delivery, including adding specific authority for state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) contracts. This contract method falls between traditional design-bid-build and design-build methods, where a general contractor provides advice during the design phase and may also be employed for construction if agreement is reached. H.R. 7 provides specific authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, where a general contractor advises during the design phase and can also be employed for construction. This method allows for construction tasks to begin before design work is complete, accelerating project delivery. MAP-21 would increase federal funding share by 5% on highway projects that demonstrate efficiency. MAP-21 would increase federal funding share by 5% on highway projects that demonstrate innovative project delivery methods or technology. This applies to projects funded from specific programs and examples of innovations listed include prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling technologies. The MAP-21 legislation includes provisions for innovative project delivery methods and technology, such as prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling. It also introduces a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" in H.R. 7 allows advance payments for moving costs for those impacted by highway projects, without limiting the number of participating states. This program aims to expedite the relocation of individuals from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. The removal of people from project right-of-way is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials suggest allowing states to use their own laws if they meet federal requirements, potentially rewriting the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) under Section 1113 of MAP-21. The CMAQ program, established to reduce transportation-related pollutants, may be rewritten under the Clean Air Act to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. EPA sets air quality standards to address pollutants that exceed certain levels in geographic areas. The CMAQ program aims to reduce transportation-related pollutants to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Areas that meet or exceed the standards are in \"attainment,\" while those that do not are in \"nonattainment.\" The program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. The CMAQ program aims to reduce transportation-related pollutants to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. It provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed amendments would change how program funding levels are established and distributed within states. The CMAQ program funding levels would be changed under the proposed amendments, with funds apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. The apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would not be a specific dollar amount but tied to the amount apportioned in FY2009 plus 10%. The CMAQ program funding levels would be changed under the proposed amendments, with funds apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. The apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would not be a specific dollar amount but tied to the amount apportioned in FY2009 plus 10%. CMAQ funds would be distributed within each state based on certain limitations and suballocations established under the new program. States would need to reserve a portion of the funds for transportation enhancements and recreational projects. The CMAQ program funding levels would be changed under the proposed amendments, with funds apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. States would need to reserve a portion of the funds for transportation enhancements, recreational projects, and specific activities related to transportation choices. The CMAQ program funding levels would be changed under the proposed amendments, with funds apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. States would need to reserve a portion of the funds for transportation enhancements, recreational projects, and specific activities related to transportation choices, including on-road and off-road trail facilities for pedestrians and bicycles. Half of the remaining funds would be suballocated for projects within designated nonattainment or maintenance areas, distributed based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Under the proposed amendments, CMAQ program funding levels would change, with funds apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. States must reserve funds for transportation enhancements and recreational projects. Half of the remaining funds would be suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with 30% set aside for low-emissions equipment. Additional provisions allow states in attainment for NAAQS to use funds for eligible projects. The CMAQ funds apportioned to a state would be available for eligible projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas. States in attainment for NAAQS can also use their funds for CMAQ-eligible projects. Proposed provisions in MAP-21 may change how the CMAQ program is implemented, including prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants like PM 2.5 through diesel retrofits. Priority Considerations in nonattainment or maintenance areas for PM 2.5 would prioritize CMAQ fund distribution for projects reducing pollutants, including diesel retrofits. Proposed evaluation and assessment of projects would require states and MPOs to consider cost-effectiveness in performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. Optional programmatic eligibility allows MPOs to conduct technical assessments for emissions reductions. Proposed Section 149(i) allows MPOs to conduct technical assessments for emissions reductions to demonstrate eligibility for CMAQ-funded projects. Proposed Section 149(k) requires MPOs to prepare performance plans for these projects. H.R. 7 includes provisions amending CMAQ program requirements, with the House bill's provisions under Section 1108 being less sweeping than those in the Senate bill. The House bill includes provisions to amend CMAQ program requirements, specifically under Section 1108, which would change project eligibility requirements. Current laws offer incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production. The House bill offers incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production. Non-tax incentives under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program and various highway programs also provide benefits for automakers producing alternative fuel vehicles. The House bill provides incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits. Highway programs offer non-tax incentives, such as allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend this authority, but also set limits if HOV lanes become too congested. The House bill and MAP-21 aim to extend incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits and allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. The bills would also limit states' authority to exempt vehicles if HOV lanes become too congested, regardless of the cause of degradation. Additionally, highway funds could be used for new charging stations at parking facilities funded through the law. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 would allow highway funds to be used for new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 would also amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for clean fuel buses and facilities, including zero emission buses. MAP-21 would amend definitions to include buses and other vehicles, with a focus on clean fuel buses and facilities. It would authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with a portion coming from the highway trust fund. Zero emission buses are explicitly included in MAP-21, unlike in H.R. 7. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 authorizes $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. The bill would transfer $40 billion from the general fund into the alternative transportation account, eliminating the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit. The bill proposes transferring $40 billion from the general fund to the alternative transportation account, replacing revenue from fuel taxes. The Federal Public Transportation Act in MAP-21 includes restructuring the transit program, introducing a State of Good Repair Grant Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit. The Guideway SGR Formula Program would distribute funding for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems that are at least seven years old. Funding would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed based on vehicle miles and route miles. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would provide competitive grants for upkeep, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old, using a formula based on vehicle miles and route miles. Funding comes from the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program, funded by the mass transit account, would distribute $75 million in competitive grants for bus and facility upkeep. A major change in the FPTA would be the elimination of the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program, with some of its funding added to other formula programs. The FPTA proposes to eliminate the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program, reallocating its funding to other formula programs. Additionally, it suggests combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program is also being shifted. The FPTA proposes combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program is shifted to be part of the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The Access to Jobs program would require recipients to spend at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments on projects for low-income individuals. Two new programs mirroring existing highway programs would also be created. The Senate bill proposes creating two new programs using funds from the Non-Urbanized Area program. One program is the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program with $20 million allocated, and the other is the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for funding in case of disasters. The bill authorizes necessary funds for these programs. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes an Emergency Relief Program similar to the Highway Emergency Relief Program, providing funding for capital and operating costs in natural or man-made disasters. It doubles the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. The bill largely maintains the current structure of the federal transit program. The House bill (H.R. 7) increases funding for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. It eliminates some programs but largely maintains the current structure of the federal transit program. Notable changes include combining several programs into one and proposing formula-based funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes combining the New Freedom Program, Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Program, and Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program into one. It suggests distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula, a change from the previous discretionary program under SAFETEA. Funding would be directed to bus transit providers in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to transit funding, including incentives for contracting out bus services and allowing private intercity operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make substantial changes to the New Starts program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes reducing the share of bus and bus facilities capital projects to a minimum of 10% and allowing private intercity and charter operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make significant changes to the New Starts program, including funding core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process by reducing major stages from four to three. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes reducing the share of bus and bus facilities capital projects to a minimum of 10% and allowing private intercity and charter operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill authorizes the evaluation and funding of core capacity improvement projects and simplifies the New Starts process by reducing major stages from four to three. The new stages are project development, engineering, and construction, with applicants required to apply in writing to the Secretary of Transportation to enter the project development phase. The bill eliminates the separate alternatives analysis currently required by law. The bill would streamline the project development process by integrating the alternatives analysis into the NEPA process. Project sponsors must provide necessary information for project justification and local financial commitment. The project can move into the Engineering Phase after completing the NEPA process with a Record of Decision, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Categorical. The project applicant has two years to complete project development after the NEPA process is concluded with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion. The project can then enter the Engineering Phase and move into construction after a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance. The Senate bill aims to advance projects more quickly with special warrants. The Senate bill aims to advance projects more quickly with special warrants for projects eligible for federal funding assistance. It would eliminate the Small Starts program but create a pilot program for expedited project delivery for three projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) provides dedicated funding for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance and costing $250 million or less. It includes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain new fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects. The bill also makes changes to the New Starts program, maintaining the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects and includes provisions for expediting projects like new urban circulator service. It eliminates the alternatives analysis but still requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. H.R. 7 includes provisions for expediting projects like new urban circulator service and changes project justification criteria, adding factors such as private contributions and intermodal connectivity. H.R. 7 includes private contributions and intermodal connectivity as evaluation factors for land use and project justification criteria. It allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use up to 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. The bill H.R. 7 allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use a percentage of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses based on the number of buses in peak service. Additionally, funds can be used for areas with high unemployment rates for up to three years, with decreasing percentages allowed each year. The House bill H.R. 7 allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses in peak service. The maximum allowable amount would decrease over three years, with modifications to the prohibition of using federal funds for operating expenses. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses in peak service. The cost share for operating expenses varies depending on the number of buses operated, with an increase in funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%. H.R. 7 increases cost share for transit agencies in urbanized and nonurbanized areas, allowing more funds for ADA paratransit. It also includes provisions for passenger and freight rail development, calling for a national rail plan and regional rail plans. The national rail plan outlined in Section 35101 includes passenger and freight rail development, with a focus on priority routes. Regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, will be developed in coordination with states to refine the national plan for each region. States may also create state rail plans to further refine regional plans, which will be relevant for federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. The bill makes amendments to the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor. It also mandates DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays more effectively. The bill requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor, with a focus on trains traveling at 200 mph or greater. Additionally, the Department of Transportation (DOT) must develop guidance on measuring train delays more effectively, conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and survey track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail operating on other railroads' tracks. The bill requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor, focusing on trains traveling at 200 mph or greater. It also mandates the Department of Transportation to survey track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail operating on other railroads' tracks and develop guidance on measuring train delays more effectively. Additionally, the bill aims to further develop an equipment pool of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services by creating a corporate or cooperative entity controlled by Amtrak and states funding corridor services. The bill aims to establish an equipment pool for standardized cars in corridor services, with Amtrak and states funding the initiative. This could lead to economies of scale in car production and maintenance but may hinder innovation in car design. Federal regulations require passenger cars to limit collision damage, setting U.S. cars apart from foreign designs. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design by potentially aligning Federal Railroad Administration regulations with foreign standards, leading to lighter U.S. passenger cars and facilitating a global market. The implementation of positive train control could lead to the modification of Federal Railroad Administration requirements to align with foreign standards, potentially facilitating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program, which aimed to reduce congestion on high-priority rail corridors but received no funding from Congress. The congestion grant program aimed to reduce congestion on rail corridors but received no funding from Congress. H.R. 7 would also amend laws regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 would amend laws on food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and requiring competitive bidding for the provision of these services. H.R. 7 would amend laws on food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and requiring competitive bidding for the provision of these services. Additionally, it would allow subsidies only if a net loss is foreseen in the selected bid. Section 36401 would expand a federal grant program to include the relocation of roads affected by railroad lines, not just the rail line itself. Section 36408 would make amendments to the Railroad Act. The Senate bill proposes amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies, expanding eligible uses of RRIF loans, and including pre-construction activities. This is part of a broader effort to address issues related to railroad lines affecting traffic flow and economic development. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies and expanding eligible uses of RRIF loans to include pre-construction activities. It also includes modest changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), raising the ceiling on maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, expanding eligible uses of RRIF loans and allowing collateral to include state or local subsidies. It also includes modifications to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) laws, increasing the maximum rate relief shippers can seek under simplified procedures and requiring the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in revenue adequacy assessments. Additionally, the bill mandates the STB to report railroad service complaints on its website and conduct reviews. The bill H.R. 7 proposes changes to the STB laws, including compiling and reporting railroad service complaints, reviewing staffing needs, repealing a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitating access to the RRIF loan program. It also addresses the mandate for positive train control (PTC) following a deadly collision in Los Angeles. The bill includes provisions to facilitate access to the RRIF loan program and mandates positive train control (PTC) for passenger and freight railroads on routes carrying toxic-by-inhalation products. PTC uses radio signaling to prevent accidents caused by human error, although some have raised concerns about its high cost for rare accidents. The Senate bill allows for an extension of the deadline for implementing PTC technology, citing obstacles such as high costs and lack of spectrum in urban areas. The bill also designates PTC implementation as an eligible use of RRIF funding. The Senate bill allows for an extension of the deadline for implementing PTC technology until December 31, 2018, if determined infeasible. It also designates PTC implementation as an eligible use of RRIF funding and requires a joint DOT/FCC study on spectrum needs. The House bill (H.R. 7) extends the deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals, allowing railroads to implement equivalent safety measures. H.R. 7 extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes it for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. The Senate bill retains NHTSA grant programs and creates an incentive grant program for highway safety, including texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. It aims to increase awareness of motor vehicle defect reporting. The House bill, H.R. 7, would consolidate NHTSA grant programs and create an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. It aims to increase awareness of motor vehicle defect reporting and raise the maximum civil penalty for safety violations. Passenger motor vehicles would be required to have event data recorders starting in 2015.
