The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for various subjects including Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Bilingual or bicultural subjects, and any other subject deemed necessary. Procedures for submission of instructional materials must be established to comply with these requirements. Instructional materials can be submitted for adoption in different subject areas every eight years, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. If revisions to instructional material are submitted for review after the specified timeframe, a fee will be assessed on the publisher or manufacturer. The fee should not exceed the reasonable costs for the department to conduct the review. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months of submission, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects.

The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure that adopted materials meet the educational needs of diverse pupil populations, represent cultural pluralism, and provide a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for publishers and schools. The materials remain on the list until a new curriculum framework is adopted.

A submission will not be reviewed for adoption until the fee is paid in full. The Legislature intends for the fee for participation in follow-up adoptions to not be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. The state board may reduce the fee upon request for small publishers or manufacturers meeting specific criteria. The revenue from fees for follow-up adoptions will be budgeted for reimbursements and can cover adoption and instructional material review costs. If there is little interest from publishers, the follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. The section specifies that general fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. It will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless a later statute extends or deletes that date."
