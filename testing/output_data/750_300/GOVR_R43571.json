    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in place since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs allow borrowers to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in certain professions or occupations. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been enacted to offer borrowers a way to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for work in specific fields or professions. Over 50 programs are authorized, with approximately 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs involve the federal government forgiving or canceling a portion of a borrower's student loan debt in exchange for fulfilling certain requirements, such as working in public service or specific occupations. Over 50 programs are authorized, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers who meet specific requirements, such as working in public service or certain occupations. These programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter particular professions or encourage public service. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide financial incentives for individuals to enter public service or high-need professions, offering debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions, occupations, or specialties, or repay their loans through an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief, such as loan discharge for total and permanent disability or death, may also be available to borrowers in certain circumstances. Other forms of debt relief beyond the scope of this report include loan discharge for various circumstances such as total and permanent disability, death, closure of the borrower's school, false certification of student eligibility, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, offered loan forgiveness for various circumstances such as unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy. In response to the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the Sputnik satellite, Congress established the NDSL program to address national security concerns about falling behind in technology. The program provided low-interest loans to college students to support their education. The NDSL program was established to support the development of students' mental resources and technical skills. It offered low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component aimed at increasing the number and quality of teachers in U.S. schools. Eligible students teaching full-time in public elementary or secondary schools could have up to half of their student loans cancelled. The NDSL program offered low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in public elementary or secondary schools. Eligible teachers could have up to half of their student loans cancelled based on years of public service completed. Loan forgiveness benefits were also available to individuals serving in Head Start programs or in the Armed Forces. The NDSL program, later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program, offered loan forgiveness for individuals in public service, including teachers, Head Start program participants, and those in the Armed Forces. Other federal student loan forgiveness programs were established for borrowers in different professions. The Federal Perkins Loan Program, formerly known as the NDSL program, provided loan forgiveness for public service workers like teachers and military personnel. Additional federal student loan forgiveness programs were created for professionals in high-need areas, such as the Health Professions Student Loan Program for medical practitioners in underserved areas. The Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP) under the Public Health Service Act allowed for up to 50% loan forgiveness for medical practitioners in underserved areas. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by law, providing policymakers with general information on their purpose. The curr_chunk provides brief descriptions of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by law, offering general information on their purpose and operation. It is not comprehensive, and readers are encouraged to refer to additional resources for detailed information. Over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law to provide debt relief to borrowers through various service requirements, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. Each program has unique characteristics. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law to provide debt relief to borrowers through service requirements, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. Each program has unique characteristics, such as borrower eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, means of providing benefits, and funding sources. Several parameters are used to broadly characterize authorized student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Consistent parameters help describe similarities and differences between programs. Borrowers in employment-focused programs must work in specific roles or locations for a set period. In employment-focused loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers work in specific roles or locations for a set period. Repayment plan-based loan forgiveness requires repayment according to an income-driven plan for a specified time, after which some or all qualifying student loan debt is forgiven. Employment-focused loan forgiveness and repayment programs require borrowers to work in specific roles or locations for a set period to qualify for benefits. At the end of the specified term, some or all of the individual's qualifying student loan debt is forgiven or repaid on his or her behalf. The availability of benefits may be an entitlement or at the discretion of the program administrator, subject to fund availability. Loan forgiveness programs are available to qualified borrowers based on specific conditions. Benefits may be entitlements or at the discretion of the program administrator, subject to fund availability. Borrowers must meet program requirements outlined in loan documents. The availability of loan forgiveness benefits is outlined in loan documents for qualified borrowers. Eligibility criteria must be met to receive these benefits, which are generally funded through mandatory appropriations. Loan forgiveness benefits for qualified borrowers are funded through mandatory appropriations and categorized into loan forgiveness for public service employment and income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location, with the entity administering the program directly repaying some or all of the borrower's student debt. Loan repayment programs provide debt relief to borrowers for service in a specific function, profession, or location by directly repaying some or all of the qualified borrower's student loan debt. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or shortages. Loan repayment benefits are offered through separate programs from federal student loans. These programs address employment needs or shortages and help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Benefits are discretionary and available to a limited number of borrowers. Loan repayment benefits are a form of compensation for targeted employees that are harder to recruit or retain. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. The extent of federal income tax liability varies depending on the type of debt relief program. Employment-focused loan forgiveness programs typically exclude forgiven debt from a borrower's gross income for federal tax purposes. Debt forgiven under an employment-focused loan forgiveness program is usually excluded from a borrower's gross income for federal tax purposes, relieving them from paying federal income tax on the forgiven amount. However, debt forgiven through income-driven repayment or public service employment may be included in a borrower's gross income, leading to a tax liability on the forgiven or repaid amount. Repayment or forgiveness for public service employment may result in a borrower being responsible for paying income tax on the forgiven amount. Three categories of debt relief programs are examined: loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. Eligible loans may be included in federal loan forgiveness programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs for public service employment are available for eligible loans, including federal student loans and loans made through programs authorized by the Public Health Service Act. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available for eligible loans, including federal student loans made through programs authorized by the Public Health Service Act and private education loans. Federal student loans eligible for loan forgiveness or repayment include loans made through HEA or PHSA programs, with some programs also including private education loans. Currently, federal student loans are only made through the Direct Loan program under Part D of Title IV, previously also through the FFEL program until June 30, 2010. Federal student loans were previously made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program until June 30, 2010, and the Federal Perkins Loan program until September 30, 2017. In the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital, and activities such as loan origination, servicing, and collection are performed by ED. In the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital, while in the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital. Loan origination, servicing, and collection are handled by federal contractors. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. In the FFEL and Direct Loan programs, loans were made by different entities with different sources of capital. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. Loan forgiveness benefits availability varied between the two programs. Loans in the Perkins Loan program were made by institutions of higher education. In the Perkins Loan program, loans were made by institutions of higher education with a combination of federal and institutional capital. The institution acted as the lender, responsible for originating, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. The Direct Loan program offers Direct Subsidized Loans to undergraduate students with financial need. The government covers interest charges while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during a grace period before repayment, and during deferment periods. The government subsidizes Direct Subsidized Loans by not charging interest while the borrower is enrolled in an eligible academic program, during a grace period before repayment, and during deferment periods. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. In FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest on the loan. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest on the loan. The borrower is responsible for paying all the interest that accrues on the loan from the time it is disbursed, although interest payments may be deferred until the loan enters repayment status. Unsubsidized Loan borrowing is also limited by annual and aggregate borrowing limits. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were made. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. There are no explicit limits to the amount an individual may borrow in PLUS Loans, based on the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) and estimated financial assistance (EFA). In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans had no explicit borrowing limits based on the student's COA and EFA. $12.5 billion in loans were made to parents of undergraduate students, and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Borrowers can consolidate federal student loans into a single loan with Direct Consolidation Loans. In FY2017, $9.9 billion in Direct PLUS Loans were made to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan and extend their repayment period. Consolidation Loans must include loans from the Direct Loan or FFEL program, as well as other federal student loan programs. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine various federal student loan programs, including Health Professions Student Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Nursing Student Loans, and Health Education Assistance Loans. This feature is important for examining loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loan programs, including Health Professions Student Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Nursing Student Loans, and Health Education Assistance Loans. This facilitates loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for borrowers. Direct Consolidation Loans have fixed interest rates based on the weighted average of consolidated loans. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, including Perkins Loans for undergraduate and graduate students. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, with interest rates based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. Perkins Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students, with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Borrowers in certain public service roles may have a portion of their Perkins Loans forgiven. Perkins Loans have a fixed interest rate of 5% per year, with interest not accruing before repayment. Public service workers may have loans cancelled. In FY2017, 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million were made. HRSA offers student loans to health professions students, making 20,849 loans totaling $162.8 million in 2016-2017.

The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans but continues to administer outstanding loans. HEAL program loans supported students pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields and were phased out between 1995 and 1999. Borrowers of these loans remain responsible for repayment. The HEAL program no longer makes new loans but administers outstanding loans for students in healthcare fields. Borrowers are responsible for repayment. Student loans are also offered by private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and IHEs. Private education loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by nonfederal entities such as private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and IHEs. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by the entity providing them. While not part of federal loan programs, some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers of certain types of private education loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. While private education loans are not part of federal loan programs, some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. All student loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers, each with unique characteristics and features. This section outlines the three categories of debt relief programs and their qualifying criteria for borrowers. The report outlines three categories of debt relief programs and their qualifying criteria for borrowers, focusing on program components such as types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, amounts and timing of debt relief, and exclusions or limitations. The report categorizes debt relief programs based on qualifying criteria for borrowers, including types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, amounts and timing of debt relief, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. Program-specific details can be found in Appendix A. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented first, starting with programs for public service. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are categorized based on availability to borrowers, with programs for public service presented first, followed by programs for income-driven repayment plans. Programs for broad public service or employment needs are limited to specific individuals and smaller in scale. Lastly, programs for public service in government employment are discussed. Loan forgiveness programs for public service employment provide debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or specific employers. These programs are considered entitlements and are tailored to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Loan forgiveness programs are generally smaller in scale compared to loan repayment programs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or specific employers. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms and conditions. Table 1 summarizes the various forgiveness programs available. Table 1 summarizes loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, detailing eligibility based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances during repayment. Table 1 summarizes loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, detailing eligibility based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances during repayment. The table highlights whether a borrower must qualify based on their economic circumstances and provides details on the operational status of the programs. Loan forgiveness benefits are potentially available to a wide array of borrowers, with eligibility criteria varying based on occupation and income. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to a wide array of borrowers, but specific eligibility criteria must be met, such as completing a specific type of service or entering a particular occupation. Programs are accessible to teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation also open to public service occupations like law enforcement and public defenders. Loan forgiveness programs are available to teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation open to public service occupations like law enforcement and public defenders. Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness is available to individuals employed full-time in public service, including government agencies and certain nonprofit organizations. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, with service commitments lasting between 1 year for partial benefits and 10 years. Loan forgiveness programs are available to teachers and individuals in public service occupations. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, with service commitments lasting between 1 year for partial benefits and 10 years. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment provides debt relief to borrowers who repay their federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not repaid their entire student loan debt. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of widely available federal student loans. Loan forgiveness programs provide debt relief to individuals who repay their federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not repaid their entire student loan debt. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment. Table 2 summarizes loan forgiveness programs that provide debt relief to individuals following income-driven repayment. The table details the operational status of each program and is organized by the date borrowers first became eligible. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources, as various factors and borrower characteristics can impact program participation. The various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are widely available to borrowers without specific employer or occupational requirements. Borrower characteristics and factors can impact program participation, making it challenging to estimate the potential scope of each program. Under income-driven repayment plans, borrowers must make monthly payments towards qualifying federal student loans for 20 to 25 years. Payments are based on factors like loan debt, family size, and income, capped at a percentage of discretionary income. Employer-specific or occupational requirements do not apply to these programs. The amount of monthly payments for income-driven repayment plans is determined by factors such as student loan debt, family size, and income. Payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income (between 10% and 20%) or other income-driven criteria. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment can also provide debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. Loan repayment for public service employment offers debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. These benefits help meet employment needs, recruit and retain qualified employees, and serve as additional compensation. The programs are limited to qualified borrowers and are subject to fund availability, not entitlements. Loan repayment programs for public service employment offer debt relief benefits to specific occupations or employers, serving as additional compensation. These programs are limited to qualified borrowers and subject to fund availability, not entitlements. Loan repayment programs for public service employment offer debt relief benefits to specific occupations or employers, serving as additional compensation. These programs are limited to qualified borrowers and subject to fund availability, not entitlements. The programs discussed are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs, with Table 3 summarizing various loan repayment programs available for meeting broad employment needs or shortages. It outlines the availability of repayment benefits based on employer and occupation specifications. Loan repayment programs for public service employment offer debt relief benefits based on employer and occupation specifications. The table organizes programs by operational status and administering department. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs are not grouped by specific occupations. Table 3 displays various employment needs addressed by 19 broad-based loan repayment programs, with 15 programs targeting health-related occupations. Data on availability and financial resources are inconsistently available across programs. Table 3 shows 19 loan repayment programs targeting various employment needs, with 15 focused on health-related occupations. These programs aim to address health care provider shortages, health care faculty needs, legal occupations, and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers are not required to fulfill their service obligations with a single program. Loan repayment programs target occupations like legal and large animal veterinarians for emergency services. Borrowers can work for multiple employers within the same class. Some programs require service in underserved areas. Participants must serve for a minimum period of time. Loan repayment programs, like loan forgiveness programs, require borrowers to serve in specific geographic locations for a minimum period of one to five years. These programs are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are potentially the smallest in scale of the loan repayment and forgiveness programs. Information on the programs' scale is often not available. Loan repayment programs are tailored to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are typically smaller in scale compared to forgiveness programs. Information on the scale of these programs is often not readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program. Table 4 summarizes the various loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Table 4 summarizes federal agencies' loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, detailing eligibility criteria and benefits available. The table summarizes federal agencies' loan repayment programs, detailing eligibility criteria and benefits available, including occupational requirements and economic circumstances. Programs are organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability to borrowers and financial resources. Table 4 displays federal agencies' loan repayment programs, categorized by administering department or agency. There are 25 programs aimed at recruiting and retaining qualified employees, with 8 specifically targeting members of the Armed Forces. Several federal agencies offer loan repayment programs to recruit and retain qualified employees, with 8 programs specifically for members of the Armed Forces. These programs vary in benefits availability, some open to all agency employees while others target specific occupations or fields designated as hard-to-fill or in-need. Loan repayment programs are offered by federal agencies to recruit and retain qualified employees, with some programs targeting specific occupations or fields in need. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of one to five years, with eligibility sometimes based on economic circumstances. Loan repayment programs typically require a minimum service commitment of one to five years, with eligibility often dependent on economic circumstances. Some programs consider economic status at the time of borrowing, while others assess it during the repayment period. Loan repayment programs can qualify individuals for benefits based on their economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Factors like service types and disadvantaged backgrounds are considered for eligibility. Programs may offer debt relief if monthly loan payments exceed a certain percentage of income. Loan repayment programs offer benefits based on economic circumstances and loan repayment period. Eligibility is determined by factors like service types and disadvantaged backgrounds. Benefits can include debt forgiveness or repayment of a specified amount. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance, with the remaining balance forgiven at the end of a specified period. Another method of awarding benefits is through an employer paying. Some programs offer loan forgiveness after making payments, while others provide repayment benefits through employer payments in flat dollar amounts or percentages of outstanding loans. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer varying flat rates or a percentage of outstanding loans to individuals. Restrictions may apply, and borrowers who have defaulted on their loans are usually ineligible for benefits. Certain federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that may limit benefits for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. Some programs also restrict borrowers from receiving benefits under other federal programs for the same service. U.S. citizenship may be required for eligibility, and borrowers may face financial penalties for not completing their service term. Borrowers must be U.S. citizens or nationals to qualify for loan repayment benefits. Financial penalties may apply if the service term is not completed. Federal programs may not allow individuals to benefit from multiple programs for the same service. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program does not provide benefits for the same service used to qualify for other loan forgiveness programs. Some programs require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Some programs may require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents to be eligible for benefits. Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to specified eligible noncitizens. Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act (HEA), Title IV programs are restricted to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and specified eligible noncitizens. Programs like PSLF are only available for Direct Loan program loans, based on borrower's citizenship and immigration status. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be limited for defaulted borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for Direct Loan program loans are restricted based on a borrower's citizenship and immigration status at the time the loans were obtained. Availability of benefits may be limited for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans, depending on certain characteristics of the defaulted loans. In the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans, but forgiveness may be granted to those who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans, but forgiveness may be granted to those who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers of defaulted loans may qualify for loan forgiveness under certain conditions. Borrowers who have not defaulted or whose loans have been accelerated may qualify for loan forgiveness based on service performed before the acceleration date. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness programs may require repayment if service obligations are not completed. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness programs may require participants to repay unearned benefits, sometimes with interest and punitive fees. Exceptions may apply for borrowers who become disabled or pass away. forgiven or repaid debt is considered part of the borrower's liabilities. Some federal loan forgiveness programs may require repayment of unearned benefits, with exceptions for disability or death. Student loan debt forgiveness is typically considered taxable income, but certain programs may exclude it from gross income for tax purposes. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income and exempt from income tax liability. Some programs specify that forgiven loans are not included in gross income, such as the Federal Perkins Loan under the HEA. Loans may still be excluded from income tax if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits can be excluded from gross income if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. The loans must have been borrowed for education, with terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions or for certain employers. Lenders must be specified, including federal and state governments. Additionally, exclusions are provided for the National Health Service. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits can be excluded from income if specific conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. The loans must be for education with cancellation terms based on work in certain professions or for specific employers. Lenders must be specified, including federal and state governments. Exclusions are also provided for programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. If the requirements are not met, individuals are responsible for any income tax liability associated with the benefits received. Individuals are responsible for paying income tax on loan forgiveness or repayment benefits if requirements are not met. Some programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Recipients can avoid significant taxation if benefits are excluded from gross income. The exclusion of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits from taxation can help recipients avoid significant taxation. However, there is debate over whether these benefits effectively incentivize borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Researchers explore three main issues in determining the impact of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits. Debate surrounds the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in encouraging individuals to enter specific professional fields, geographic areas, or government service. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without debt relief, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief programs influence students to borrow more. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in encouraging individuals to enter specific professional fields, geographic areas, or government service is debated. Key issues include whether student loan debt is the main barrier and if debt relief programs influence students to borrow more for postsecondary education expenses. Another aspect to consider is the cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received. The analysis discusses the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing individuals' employment choices and the costs incurred by the federal government. Considerations include whether recipients would have engaged in qualifying service without the programs and the influence of such programs on borrowing behavior for postsecondary education expenses. The influence of loan forgiveness or repayment programs on employment choices can be assessed by comparing the career paths of individuals with access to these benefits to those without. Limited evaluations have been done for federal programs, but data from the National Institutes of Health program may provide insights. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to encourage medical research careers. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage individuals to pursue medical research careers at the NIH or in general. Recipients were found to be more likely to continue in medical research, even if they left the NIH, suggesting the program is effective in meeting its goals. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage individuals to pursue medical research careers. A study suggests that recipients who received loan repayment benefits and left the NIH were more likely to continue a career in medical research. While the program may be meeting its goals, it may not be the sole reason for individuals to stay in targeted positions. Other research indicates that some individuals would have entered certain fields even without loan repayments. Some individuals may have entered certain fields or positions even without loan repayments for various reasons, potentially making the program unnecessary and ineffective in certain situations. For example, in recent years, law school graduates facing limited private sector opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs regardless of loan repayment incentives. In recent years, law school graduates have had fewer employment opportunities, leading some to take public interest or government jobs. Some individuals may have accepted loan repayment for a job they would have taken anyway. For example, healthcare providers in rural areas would have practiced there even without loan repayment. Loan repayment programs may seem unnecessary, but evidence shows that participants, especially physicians in rural areas, would not have taken certain positions without the incentive of loan repayment benefits. The NIH found that recipients had competing job offers and viewed loan repayment as a unique and attractive benefit, particularly for physicians with higher salary offers. The NIH found that job offers with loan repayment benefits were attractive to physicians with competing higher salary offers, increasing retention in research. Loan repayment programs are effective recruitment tools, but funding cuts can undermine their effectiveness. Loan repayment programs are effective at recruiting and maintaining staff, but funding cuts can undermine their effectiveness. Uncertainty in availability of benefits and insufficient award amounts may not be strong incentives for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Loan repayment award amounts may not be a sufficient incentive for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Researchers suggest that financial benefits should offset a share of education costs to be successful. Additional program design elements, such as an individual's responsibility to pay federal loans, may also impact the effectiveness of loan repayment programs. Some loan repayment programs may not offer enough incentives for individuals to pursue postsecondary education. Participants in the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program are responsible for paying federal income taxes on the loan repayment amount, making the program less attractive. Participants in the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program are responsible for the tax liability, which can account for 39% of the repayment amount. The short-term nature of these programs may lead to turnover as individuals may change jobs once they have received the full benefit. This instability could result in a less stable workforce for employers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may lead to turnover as individuals may change jobs after realizing the full benefit, resulting in a less stable workforce for employers. The assessment of these programs also questions whether individuals would enter a field or take a job without student loan debt. The assessment of loan forgiveness and repayment programs considers whether student loan debt influences career choices. Researchers have found that debt may not always impact job decisions, as other factors like geographic location also play a role. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) offers loan assistance. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) provides loan repayment benefits to physicians who enter primary care and practice in specific geographic areas, which may deter physicians from entering primary care medicine for various reasons. Physicians may be deterred from entering primary care medicine due to lower compensation, preference for specialties, or reluctance to take on administrative duties. Debt levels can also influence career decisions, especially for certain racial and ethnic groups. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available to address debt-related concerns in career choices. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available to individuals for whom debt is not a factor in career choice, providing a financial inducement to enter lower-paying fields like primary care medicine. However, the amount received is generally far less than the overall lifetime earnings gap between primary care and specialty physicians. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician. Borrowers are unlikely to have $3.5 million in student loan debt, so loan repayments cannot fully compensate for the lower lifetime earnings from entering primary care. High levels of debt do influence job choice, as seen in the influence of law school debt on legal practice. High levels of debt influence job choice, leading graduates to opt for higher-paying jobs in sectors like law and avoiding lower-paying fields such as education or non-profit work. High levels of debt influence job choice, leading graduates to opt for higher-paying jobs in sectors like law and avoiding lower-paying fields such as education or non-profit work. Some studies suggest that law school debt levels may play a secondary role in career decisions, with demographic characteristics being a more dominant factor. Loan repayment programs may have little to no effect on career trajectories. The impact of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates is uncertain. Demographic characteristics may play a more significant role than debt levels in decision-making. There are concerns about whether these programs encourage students to take on more debt for their education. Debt relief programs like loan repayment and forgiveness can lead students to rely more on student loans for education expenses. Concerns have been raised about programs that offer unlimited debt relief after making capped payments based on income. Monthly payments under income-driven plans are based on income, not the amount owed, potentially leading to full loan forgiveness. Under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, loan payments are capped at a smaller portion of discretionary income for a limited duration, with the possibility of forgiveness after meeting certain conditions. Monthly payments are tied to income, not the amount owed, and may be a percentage of discretionary income. Critics argue that this approach may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers and could encourage over-borrowing. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may render the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers and encourage over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits to borrowers result in costs to the federal government. The PSLF program offers forgiveness benefits to individuals who repay loans under an IDR plan for 10 years while working in public service, resulting in costs to the federal government. Costs incurred depend on the program structure, including loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs provide benefits that are integrated into the system. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have three categories of costs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. These programs offer benefits integrated into federal student loan programs, which include federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, while the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs are incurred for these programs. The Federal credit system includes federal direct loans and loan guarantees. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, while the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory appropriations according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Loans and loan guarantees are measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government on a net present value basis. The federal budget reflects the unreimbursed costs of making or guaranteeing loans, including the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, excluding administrative expenses. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, excluding administrative expenses. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return from extending credit to borrowers. Loan forgiveness benefits are also considered. Loan subsidy cost refers to the cost incurred by the government in providing subsidies to borrowers. A negative cost indicates that the government earns a return from extending credit. Loan forgiveness benefits, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers in the Direct Loan program, increase loan subsidy costs by altering expected cash flows. Loan forgiveness benefits, like Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers in the Direct Loan program, increase loan subsidy costs by reducing cash flows to the government. Borrowers qualifying for forgiveness have a portion of their loan balance discharged by the government, leading to higher subsidy costs for the program. Loan forgiveness benefits, such as those in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and income-based repayment plans, increase loan subsidy costs by reducing cash flows to the government. The estimated cost of providing these benefits is accounted for in the fiscal year when the loan was originally made. Loan forgiveness programs like PSLF and income-based repayment plans increase loan subsidy costs by reducing government cash flows. The direct costs of borrower benefits are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year when the benefits are provided. Loan repayment benefits are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year when the benefits are provided, either through discretionary or mandatory funding. Availability of funds may limit benefits to eligible borrowers. Loan repayment benefits are funded through discretionary or mandatory appropriations, which may limit benefits to eligible borrowers based on fund availability. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include GESLR and JRJ, while NHSCLRP is funded through mandatory appropriations. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits have a unique funding mechanism. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program (NHSCLRP) is funded through mandatory appropriations, unlike most loan forgiveness programs. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are specified in loan terms and conditions, with loan forgiveness granted by the institution that issued the loan. Funding for Perkins Loan reimbursement is not part of a federal credit program. The Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program and funding for loan cancellation benefits comes from discretionary appropriations. Despite no funding being appropriated since FY2009, eligible borrowers have had their loans canceled, with institutions absorbing the costs. Since FY2009, eligible borrowers have had their Perkins Loans canceled without funding being appropriated. Institutions have absorbed the costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the federal government. The ED maintains a record of reimbursement amounts for eligible institutions. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately from programmatic costs. Administrative costs for loan forgiveness benefits are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Loan repayment programs are managed by various agencies. Loan forgiveness benefits under federal credit programs have administrative costs funded separately through annual appropriations. Various agencies administer loan repayment programs with differing funding mechanisms for administrative costs. Limited information is available on the actual government costs of these programs. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are often based on projected future forgiveness amounts, while loan repayment programs provide information on benefits provided in a given fiscal year. Limited information is available on the costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Data on benefits provided and recipients for specific programs are presented in an appendix. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was discussed in a 2008 notice of proposed rulemaking. In Appendix A, the amount of debt relief and number of recipients for each program are detailed. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was estimated to cost the government $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion associated with loans made before FY2008. Loan recipient estimates were not provided by the Department of Education. In the 2015 Final Regulation, the Department of Education estimated that approximately 6 million borrowers from 1994 to 2025 will be eligible for the REPAYE repayment plan, with about 2 million expected to enroll. The availability of the REPAYE plan is projected to cost around $15.4 billion. Loan forgiveness benefits for federal credit programs are associated with the cohort year in which a loan is made. Approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible for REPAYE from 1994 to 2025, with an estimated 2 million choosing to enroll, costing around $15.4 billion. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) plan is projected to cost $2.1 billion over FY2012-FY2021, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers opting for it, and around 400,000 receiving loan forgiveness. In estimating the cost of the PAYE plan, the Department of Education projected that around 1.67 million borrowers would choose this repayment option. Out of these, approximately 400,000 borrowers would receive loan forgiveness either through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment. The average original loan balance of borrowers receiving forgiveness was estimated to be $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to interest-only payments. The Department of Education estimated that around 1.67 million borrowers would choose the PAYE plan, with approximately 400,000 borrowers receiving loan forgiveness. The average original loan balance for borrowers receiving forgiveness was $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to interest-only payments. Additionally, ED estimated that 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would elect the IBR plan, but did not provide estimations on forgiveness benefits. In the 2008 NPRM, it was estimated that 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 loan cohort would repay their loans under IBR, with 44,000 having some portion forgiven. For the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers, the Department of Education estimated that 146,000 borrowers from the FY2012 cohort would repay according to IBR, with 52,000 of them having some portion of their debt forgiven after 25 years. Loan forgiveness benefits are contingent upon borrower repayment behavior and labor market conditions. The Department of Education estimated that 52,000 borrowers would have some debt forgiven after 25 years under the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers. Congress may need to review federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are needed. The Department of Education estimated that 52,000 borrowers would have some debt forgiven after 25 years under the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers. Congress may need to review federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are needed. Whether existing policy on the availability of federal student loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is optimal or whether changes should be made. Several issues related to loan forgiveness and loan repayment policy might be examined. Should multiple programs make available loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits for borrowers who engage in similar types of activities? Does the structure of some loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs lead to a financial windfall for borrowers who engage in the same type of activity they otherwise would have even if debt relief were not available? Is sufficient information available to assess whether existing programs are effectively achieving their intended purposes? Programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if they have the same goals and activities. This can happen when the same borrower benefits from multiple programs for the same service, or when multiple programs serve the same group of individuals for the same purpose. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs can overlap when the same borrower benefits from multiple programs for the same service, potentially leading to unnecessary administrative costs. Some programs restrict recipients from receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same qualifying service, while others do not have such limitations. Some programs restrict recipients from receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same qualifying service, while others do not have such limitations, allowing individuals to receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed. For example, a federal agency worker may qualify for up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program, while also qualifying for forgiveness of the remaining student loan amount. An individual working in a federal agency may receive up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program, with a total of $60,000. They can also qualify for forgiveness of the remaining student loan debt after 10 years of service and 120 monthly payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. If they use the benefits from the GESLRP towards the 120 payments for PSLF, they would be receiving benefits from two programs for the same service. The Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program (GESLRP) offers up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits for federal agency employees. If these benefits are used towards the 120 monthly payments required for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), individuals may receive benefits from two programs for the same service. Additionally, overlapping programs may result in the federal government funding administrative costs for multiple programs serving the same purpose or group of people, such as the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) for nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty. Both programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Under NFLRP, HRSA grants money to nursing schools for their own loan repayment programs. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) are both administered by the HRSA. The NFLRP grants money to nursing schools for loan repayment programs, potentially creating an administrative burden if both programs serve the same group of individuals. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing these programs to avoid double benefits. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing the NELRP and NFLRP programs to avoid double benefits for individuals in the same group. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields or public service roles that may be challenging to fill. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields or public service roles that may be challenging to fill, potentially providing windfalls for some individuals regardless of benefit availability. For example, certain loan forgiveness plans have no limits on the amounts that may be forgiven. Some loan forgiveness programs have no limits on the amounts that may be forgiven, including the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and income-driven repayment plans. Concerns have been raised about individuals borrowing large amounts, especially through non-need-based PLUS Loans, with the possibility of loan forgiveness. Congress may need to address these issues. Some loan forgiveness programs have no limits on forgiven amounts, raising concerns about individuals borrowing excessively, especially through non-need-based PLUS Loans. Congress may need to consider establishing limits on forgiveness amounts to prevent abuse. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may not always lead individuals to specific occupations if they are already seeking employment in those fields. However, these programs can be effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees. Reports suggest that loan repayment programs do influence individuals' career choices to some extent. Loan repayment programs can be effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees by influencing individuals' career choices to some extent. Congress may consider implementing more specific funding controls to tailor these programs to individual needs. Congress could consider implementing more specific funding controls for loan repayment programs, such as defining eligibility criteria more narrowly or directing fund usage through appropriations measures. Insufficient data is available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for many programs, with additional data becoming available once borrowers apply for benefits. Limited programmatic data is available for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must remain employed in a public service job for 10 years while making 120 monthly payments on their loans. Data on forgiveness benefits received is limited as borrowers only became eligible to apply for benefits on October 1, 2017. Limited programmatic data is available for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments on their loans to be eligible for forgiveness benefits. Data on forgiveness benefits is limited as borrowers only became eligible to apply for benefits on October 1, 2017. Borrowers may not be required to document their employment in public service jobs, making it difficult to project future participation in the program. Loan forgiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of comprehensive data. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods. However, longitudinal data on participants beyond program administration is not collected. Loan forgiveness programs exist for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods. However, longitudinal data on participants beyond program administration is not collected, making it difficult to assess program effects. The availability of data on program outcomes may be limited, making it challenging to assess program effects and determine if program design changes could enhance effectiveness. Loan forgiveness programs vary in the types and amounts of student loan debt eligible for relief. Design changes could improve the effectiveness of loan forgiveness programs, which vary in the types and amounts of student loan debt eligible for relief. Some programs have limitations on specific loan types or amounts, while others offer forgiveness for multiple loan types with fewer restrictions on maximum amounts. Consideration may be needed to impose additional limitations on qualifying student loan debt for forgiveness. Consideration may be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for loan forgiveness and repayment programs, especially with the recent increase in non-need-based loan aid availability. The availability of student loan repayment or forgiveness programs may incentivize students to over-borrow. Should limits be set on borrowing non-need-based federal student loans that can be discharged through these programs? The selection criteria for student loan repayment programs can vary among federal agencies, leading to unpredictability and potential lack of program administration. In CY 2016, 34 federal agencies offered loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse benefits if they do not complete their service. Participants cannot be in the excepted service. The GESLRP requires participants to sign a service agreement to serve in a paying agency for three years and reimburse benefits if they do not complete their service. Participants cannot be in the excepted service due to the nature of their position. Agencies have discretion in determining who receives benefits, with examples such as the Department of Defense recruiting for nursing, engineering, and contracting positions, and the Department of State providing benefits to individuals with a loan balance. The GESLRP allows agencies like the Department of Defense to recruit employees in nursing, engineering, and contracting positions. The Department of State provides benefits to individuals with a loan balance of at least $5,000. Variations in eligibility requirements across agencies can make it challenging for participants to understand. This may limit the program's ability to attract qualified individuals to work in the federal government. The GESLRP program's eligibility requirements may be difficult for participants to discern, potentially limiting its ability to attract qualified individuals to work in the federal government.
