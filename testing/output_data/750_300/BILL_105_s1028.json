    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Act establishes a pilot project for specific national forests to implement this proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal, dated June 1993, outlines a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on specified Federal lands to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource management activities. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on specified Federal lands within California to implement and demonstrate resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California designated as \"Available for Group Selection\" on the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal map. The project excludes spotted owl habitat areas and focuses on riparian protection and compliance. During the pilot project on Federal lands in California, spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the designated area will be deferred from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will oversee compliance with these exclusions during the project term. During the pilot project, resource management activities and timber harvesting are prohibited on designated Federal lands in California under the direction of the Regional Forester for region 5. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities and timber harvesting are prohibited on designated Federal lands in the Lassen National Forest, Tahoe National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all activities in the pilot project area. During the pilot project in California, resource management and timber harvesting activities are restricted in designated Federal lands. Guidelines from a Forest Service document apply to these activities in the pilot project area. The Forest Service research document from March 1993, co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas, provides guidelines for resource management activities in designated Federal lands in California, focusing on the conservation of the California spotted owl. Compliance with applicable Federal law and conservation standards is required for all management activities. During the pilot project, resource management activities on Federal lands must comply with Federal law and conservation guidelines for the California spotted owl as outlined in the California Spotted Owl Sierran Provence Interim Guidelines or subsequent final guidelines. This includes fuelbreak construction on an acreage basis. The Secretary will implement resource management activities on Federal lands within the pilot project area, including fuelbreak construction and vegetation management on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. The Secretary will implement vegetation management methods consistent with the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year, including group selection and individual tree selection for forest management. The pilot project aims to achieve a desired future condition of all-age, multistory, fire resilient forests through group selection on 0.57% of the area annually, individual tree selection, and a total acreage limit of 70,000 acres per year for resource management activities. Riparian management is also included in the program. The pilot project aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through group and individual tree selection on a limited acreage of 70,000 acres per year. Riparian management, including protection zones and restoration projects, is also part of the program. The Secretary will prioritize cost-effective means for implementing resource management activities. Funding for the project is also addressed. The pilot project aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through tree selection on 70,000 acres per year. The Secretary will prioritize cost-effective means for resource management activities and use specific funds provided by the Forest Service. The pilot project aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through tree selection on 70,000 acres per year. Specific funds provided by the Forest Service will be used for resource management activities according to the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal and excess funds allocated for administration and management of certain national forests. The Secretary is prohibited from using appropriated funds for the pilot project. The pilot project aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through tree selection on 70,000 acres per year in Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest. The Secretary is prohibited from using appropriated funds for the project, and forest supervisors have flexibility to allocate excess funds for forest management. Supervisors of Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest can use excess funds for forest management activities. The Secretary or forest supervisors cannot use certain authorities if they believe it is not appropriate. The Secretary or forest supervisors cannot utilize certain authorities if it will limit other non-timber related multiple use activities. Additionally, only 12 percent of funds can be used for general administration or overhead, with at least 88 percent allocated for implementation. Authorized supplemental funds are available to be appropriated for the pilot project, and baseline funds must include existing funding levels for resource management activities. The pilot project will be conducted with necessary funds, including existing baseline funding levels for resource management activities. The project will last until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specific national forests or up to five years after the enactment of the Act. The pilot project will revise land and resource management plans for specific national forests within five years. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required, and private contracts may be used for implementation. Forest Plan Amendments must be completed within 180 days. The Forest Service may use private contracts to carry out requirements of the section. The Regional Forester for Region 5 must amend land and resource management plans for specific national forests within 180 days, including incorporating the pilot project and area designations. The Forest Service must prepare alternatives for the pilot project in the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal, incorporating resource management activities and making changes based on environmental analyses and applicable laws. Reporting requirements are also specified. The Forest Service must report on the pilot project's status to Congress annually, in compliance with relevant laws. The Forest Service, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must annually report to Congress on the pilot project's status. The report must include a detailed account of funds used and activities performed in the previous fiscal year. The Forest Service, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must annually report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a detailed account of funds used and activities performed in the previous fiscal year. This includes a schedule of amounts drawn from each account for resource management activities and a description of total acres treated for various activities such as forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, and water yield increases. The Forest Service, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must annually report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a detailed account of funds used and activities performed in the previous fiscal year. This includes a schedule of amounts drawn from each account for resource management activities and a description of total acres treated for various activities such as forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, water yield increases, and economic benefits to local communities. The Forest Service, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must annually report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a comparison of revenues and costs for resource management activities on Federal lands in the pilot project area from 1992 to 1997, and a schedule for activities in the upcoming calendar year. The Forest Service, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must annually report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a comparison of revenues and costs for resource management activities on Federal lands in the pilot project area from 1992 to 1997, a schedule for activities in the upcoming calendar year, and a science-based assessment and report after 6 months of the second year of the pilot project. Federal funds for each annual report shall not exceed $50,000. The Secretary shall compile a science-based assessment and report on the effectiveness of the pilot project in meeting its goals, including watershed monitoring of treated lands addressing water releases, quality changes, and yield changes over the short and long term.
