    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States must enhance its scientific and technical enterprise by producing more scientists and engineers. The education system needs to promote the study of science and mathematics to address the lagging performance of U.S. students in these fields compared to international peers. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, especially as advances are being made in areas like nanotechnology. A program of loan forgiveness is designed to attract students to pursue careers in these fields. The United States should prioritize leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, particularly in nanotechnology. Loan forgiveness programs can attract students to careers in these fields, helping maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who have applied in accordance with the requirements. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who have applied in compliance with specific requirements, including being a new borrower and a teacher in STEM fields at an elementary or secondary school. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who are teachers of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics at an elementary or secondary school, or are mathematics, science, or engineering professionals, and agree to complete 5 consecutive years of service in that position. The Secretary will not make payments for interest that do not meet specific criteria. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who are teachers of STEM subjects or professionals in STEM fields. To qualify, individuals must complete 5 consecutive years of service in the designated position. The Secretary will not make interest payments that accrue before the repayment period begins or before the agreement is signed. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible individuals who are teachers of STEM subjects or professionals in STEM fields. Participants are selected based on national security, homeland security, and economic security needs of the United States. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible individuals selected based on national security, homeland security, and economic security needs of the United States, as well as academic record or job performance. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible individuals selected based on national security, homeland security, and economic security needs, as well as academic record or job performance. Eligible applicants may be chosen based on the likelihood of completing the 5-year service obligation and remaining in science, mathematics, or engineering after fulfilling the service requirement. Loan interest payments under this Act are contingent on appropriations. If funds are insufficient, priority will be given based on specified criteria or other relevant factors determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will prioritize interest payments for qualified applicants based on previous fiscal year payments. The Secretary has the authority to create necessary regulations.
