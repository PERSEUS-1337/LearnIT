The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. It is part of the Tri-State Mining District and is prone to flooding due to its location. Mining companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer. Mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma began in the early 1900s and continued until the 1970s. Companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer due to water in the ore-producing aquifer. The mining, mostly on Indian land, accounted for a significant portion of the nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption during World War I, creating millions of tons of waste tailings. During World War I, mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma accounted for over 45% of the Nation's lead and zinc consumption. This mining generated millions of tons of waste tailings, known as chat, which the Department of the Interior recommended to be stockpiled aboveground for later reprocessing. This recommendation was reiterated during World War II, and in 1960, Congress passed the Small Producers Lead and Zinc Mining Stabilization Act to support the industry. In 1979, acid mine water began discharging at the surface from several locations at the Site, as the underground mine workings refilled with water from the Boone Aquifer, creating acid mine water from dissolved sulfide minerals. In 1983, the Site was placed on the National Priorities List and in 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency started remediation efforts for the acid mine water. However, by 1994, it was deemed nearly impossible to fully remediate the water despite millions of dollars spent. The Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 1994 that remediating the acid mine water at the Site was essentially impossible due to the presence of numerous open mine shafts and boreholes. Millions of tons of chat scar the surface area, with stockpiled chat laced with heavy metals. The open mine shafts at the Site recharge underground mine workings and store water. Millions of tons of chat with toxic heavy metals scar the surface area, contributing to flood problems in surrounding communities. The stockpiled chat is used for construction purposes. The stockpiled chat at the Site is used for construction purposes, including roads, backfill for yards, driveways, and foundations of homes. However, this has led to contamination of residential areas with heavy metals, such as lead, requiring remediation by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1994. Residential areas at the Site contaminated with heavy metals, including lead. EPA started remediation in 1994 due to unsafe lead levels in yards. Studies show many children have elevated blood lead levels, causing health issues. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk. Mining left underground cavities at the Site. Scientific studies indicate that dust from stockpiled chat at the Site poses a health risk, leading to learning disabilities and severe health problems. Subsidence events, some exceeding 100 feet in diameter, have occurred in populated areas and near schools. Despite these dangers, no remediation efforts have been initiated by any US government agency. No remediation efforts have been made by the US Government to address the health risks posed by stockpiled chat and subsidence dangers at the Site. Comprehensive epidemiological studies have not been conducted, and the Site is deemed unsafe for human habitation due to its unique environmental problems. No specific details were provided in SEC. 3 regarding assistance. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the 17 square mile area identified in Governor Keating's Tar Creek Superfund Task Force Final Report. This includes the communities of Picher and Cardin on the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will be considered the displacing agency for the application of that Act. The EPA will work with other officials to resolve environmental and health issues at the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma."
