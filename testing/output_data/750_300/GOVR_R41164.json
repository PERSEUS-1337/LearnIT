The first funding round was announced in July 2009, with grants and loans awarded for various project categories such as last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects. The ARRA broadband funding includes grants for last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Up to $1.2 billion is available for last mile and middle mile projects, up to $50 million for public computer centers. The ARRA broadband funding includes grants for last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Projects could be last mile remote area, last mile nonremote area, or middle mile. Up to $1.2 billion is available for last mile and middle mile projects, up to $50 million for public computer centers. On September 9, 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round application period. Over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for projects reaching all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia, exceeding the available funding by seven times. Table 1 provides a breakdown of first round applications data with respect to program and project category. On January 15, 2010, NTIA and RUS announced the second and final round of ARRA broadband funding, totaling $4.8 billion. Both agencies streamlined the application process based on feedback from the first round. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $2.6 billion was allocated for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. NTIA and RUS made significant changes based on feedback from the first round, with each agency having its own separate NOFA. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. Applicants could apply to either BTOP or BIP, but not both. BTOP reoriented its infrastructure program. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA/BTOP primarily focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP reoriented its infrastructure program towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) grants, supporting middle mile projects serving anchor institutions. BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" project category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was removed, and projects were required to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects only required an eligible entity and a completed application. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP focused on projects covering at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects required an eligible entity, completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and delivered speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced new grant programs like Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding on April 7, 2010. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP focused on projects covering rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. RUS also received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in funding. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, RUS received a total of 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in federal funds. This included 251 applications for Sustainable Broadband Adoption and 261 applications for Public Computer Centers. Combined with NTIA, there were 1643 applications requesting a total of $22.2 billion in federal funds, which was 26% less than the first round. In the second round, RUS and NTIA received a total of $22.2 billion in federal funding requests, which was 26% less than the first round. RUS received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 for Technical Assistance, and 2 for Rural Library Broadband. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding, including 233 BTOP projects ($3.9 billion) and 320 BIP projects ($3.6 billion). In total, NTIA and RUS completed all BTOP and BIP award announcements by January 1, 2010, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included $3.9 billion for 233 BTOP projects and $3.6 billion for 320 BIP projects, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdown includes project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. Awards data breakdown includes project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. About half of broadband infrastructure funding was awarded to middle mile projects (51%) and the other half to last mile projects (49%). Middle mile projects are mainly BTOP, while last mile projects are predominantly BIP. Deployment of broadband infrastructure can involve various technologies such as fiber, wireless, cable modem, DSL, and satellite. 56% of funded infrastructure projects are fiber-based. Loan funding from BIP was primarily awarded to last mile projects, accounting for 93% of the total loan funding. Table 4 indicates that 56% of infrastructure projects funded are fiber-based, with projects involving fiber accounting for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. In terms of last mile project technologies, 47% are fiber, 23% are DSL, 17% are wireless, 6% are multiple, 3% are cable modem, and 1% are satellite. The remaining technologies could not be determined from the public information released. Table A-1 in the Appendix provides a state-by-state breakdown of BTOP and BIP funding, while Table A-2 shows per capita funding by state. Funding is linked to the service area covered by the project, and may include NTIA-estimated per-State share of awards impacting multiple states. Table A-3 lists NTIA and RUS multistate awards. NTIA and RUS are now focused on monitoring and overseeing the progress of broadband awards. The broadband awards process has concluded, and NTIA and RUS are now monitoring and overseeing funded projects. Projects must be completed within two to three years. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. The federal government funding through March 4, 2011, includes a $20 million addition. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extension Act, 2011 includes a $20 million addition for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants. Funding for the award was obtained through the Department of Interior's National Business Center. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight. The impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in areas served by grantees is being measured. Funding for the award was obtained through the Department of Interior's National Business Center. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds will inform Congress on whether broadband grant and loan programs should be continued, modified, reduced, expanded, or eliminated. The funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of broadband grants will inform Congress on whether to continue, modify, reduce, expand, or eliminate broadband grant and loan programs. Insights from the successes and failures of funded projects could shape future national broadband policies."
