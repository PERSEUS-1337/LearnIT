    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation rate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program, resulting in unclaimed federal dollars by working poor families in California. In 2015, California implemented a state EITC to help the poorest working individuals in addition to the federal EITC. This was done to address the low participation rate in the federal program, leading to unclaimed federal dollars by the working poor in the state. To alleviate the tax burden on working poor individuals and families, California aims to increase their wages and income by promoting awareness of the federal and state earned income tax credits. This initiative also seeks to ensure that the state receives its share of federal EITC funds and inject additional money into the California economy. The act aims to provide cost-effective assistance to eligible taxpayers through employer and state notices, and by ensuring eligible Californians claim both federal and state EITC.

For the purposes of this part, key terms are defined: \"Employer\" refers to any California employer required to provide unemployment insurance, \"Employee\" is someone covered by unemployment insurance, \"Federal EITC\" is the federal earned income tax credit, and \"California EITC\" is the state earned income tax credit. The federal EITC and California EITC are defined as earned income tax credits.
