    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care. Congress finds that approximately 26 million individuals in the US care for adult family members or friends who are chronically ill, disabled, or terminally ill. Additionally, around 18 million children have conditions requiring caregiver supervision, and about 6 million children live with relatives due to parental inability or unwillingness to care for them. Approximately 6,000,000 children in the United States live with a grandparent or other relative because their parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. An estimated 165,000 children with disabilities live with a foster care parent, and nearly 4,000,000 individuals of all ages with mental retardation or developmental disabilities live with their families. Additionally, almost 25 percent of the Nation's elders experience multiple chronic disabling conditions. Approximately 600,000 Americans die at home each year, relying on extensive family caregiving before their deaths. 42 percent of individuals in the United States needing daily living assistance are under age 65, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women, and the family caregiver role can result in emotional, physical, and financial hardship. If family caregivers had to be replaced with paid services, it would cost around $200 billion annually. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women, facing emotional, physical, and financial hardship. They often struggle to find information on respite care, which is insufficient and mainly targets lower-income populations and elderly caregivers, leaving many without adequate support. The available respite care programs are inadequate, primarily serving lower-income and elderly caregivers, leaving many without support. There is a shortage of trained respite workers, prompting the need for State and local lifespan respite care programs. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish respite care programs, improve information dissemination to family caregivers, provide respite care services, and promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery and worker training.
