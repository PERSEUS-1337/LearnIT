    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy since the post-Cold War period. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, the DPRK's weapons programs continue to advance. The United States has been trying to address North Korea's weapons programs since the early 1990s through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, but without success. U.S. interests in North Korea include security, political, and human rights concerns, with military alliances obligating the U.S. to defend South Korea and Japan from any North Korean attack. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within striking range of North Korea. The United States has military alliances with South Korea and Japan, obligating them to defend these allies from North Korean attacks. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within striking range of North Korean missiles, posing a risk to the U.S. homeland. Negotiations surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons program impact U.S. relations with major powers and could have severe global economic implications. Negotiations and diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear weapons program affect U.S. relations with major powers in the region, especially China and South Korea. Dealing with the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang, which is not bound by international norms, is crucial due to the potential impact of a conflict or government collapse on the regional and global economy. North Korea, with a population of 25 million, was founded on the principle of self-reliance by Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea, a country of 25 million people, was founded on the principle of self-reliance by Kim Il-sung. The Kim family's totalitarian control has enabled the country to resist outside influences and maintain one of the world's largest militaries. North Korea, founded on self-reliance by Kim Il-sung, has maintained totalitarian control to resist outside influences and build a large military. This militarization acts as a deterrent to foreign intervention and gives Pyongyang leverage for diplomatic and economic concessions. However, North Korea's provocative behavior and opaque policymaking have hindered its economic growth. North Korea's militarization has allowed it to extract diplomatic and economic concessions from neighbors, but it has also stunted economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite indications of a strengthening economy under Kim's rule, internal conditions remain difficult with widespread poverty, and increased access to outside information could lead to discontent if growth falters. North Korea's internal situation remains difficult, with widespread poverty and limited access to outside information. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress has a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea, including passing sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Past nuclear agreements involved Congress authorizing millions of dollars in energy assistance with conditions on aid provision. In future agreements, Congress will need to authorize funds if the U.S. provides aid in exchange for North Korean denuclearization steps. In future arrangements, if the United States agrees to provide aid in exchange for DPRK steps on denuclearization, Congress will need to authorize and appropriate funds. Congress has conducted oversight on North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, sanctions evasion, and linkage with other governments. North Korea's advancements in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have influenced U.S. policymakers' assessments. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat to the United States, with recent tests showing the country's capability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. This acceleration in capability has made North Korea a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security problem. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have made it nearly capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. This has elevated North Korea to a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security concern, surpassing the Middle East and terrorism in the first 18 months of the Trump Administration. Pyongyang's threats have expanded across various domains, including nuclear weapons, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattack capacity. North Korea conducted three nuclear tests between January 2016 and September 2017, with the sixth test being its most powerful to date. Additionally, in 2017, North Korea conducted multiple missile tests. North Korea's missile and nuclear capabilities have raised concerns, with tests showing potential to reach the US. The country is also developing submarine-based ballistic missiles to evade defense systems. In 2017, North Korea was blamed for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack. North Korea's missile program aims to evade U.S. defense systems. In 2017, the Trump Administration accused North Korea of the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, showcasing their cyber capabilities. The response included a \"maximum pressure\" policy to pressure Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic means. The Trump Administration aimed to pressure Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, similar to the Obama Administration's approach. They led the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea. The Trump Administration successfully led the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea, expanding requirements for member states to cut ties with the DPRK. They also emphasized the option of a preventive military strike against North Korea. The Trump Administration led the UNSC to pass sanctions against North Korea and considered a preventive military strike. Trump's statements on North Korea have been contradictory, causing confusion about U.S. policy. The Trump Administration's contradictory statements on North Korea have caused confusion about U.S. policy. In early 2018, North Korea accepted an invitation to attend the Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations and eventually a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in Singapore. In early 2018, North Korea accepted an invitation to attend the Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations. This paved the way for a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in Singapore. Kim Jong-un's charm offensive included meetings with Moon, Xi Jinping, and eventually Trump. Opinions vary on the reasons behind Kim's change in approach. Xi Jinping played a crucial role in facilitating the historic meeting between the U.S. and DPRK leaders. Kim Jong-un's shift towards diplomacy was influenced by factors such as Trump's aggressive rhetoric, economic sanctions, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's belief in his nuclear deterrent capabilities. On June 12, 2018, President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program, building a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, and the future of U.S. relations with North Korea. Trump committed to provide security guarantees to Kim. Following the summit in Singapore, Trump and Kim issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The document focuses on establishing new bilateral relations and working towards a lasting peace regime. The joint statement between Trump and Kim focuses on establishing new bilateral relations, working towards a lasting peace regime, and North Korea's commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The agreement also includes efforts to recover the remains of U.S. troops from the Korean War, with follow-on negotiations to be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. No mention was made of North Korea's ballistic missile program. The agreement between Trump and Kim focused on establishing new relations, peace regime, and denuclearization. Efforts to recover U.S. troops' remains were included, with follow-on negotiations led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump announced the suspension of U.S.-South Korea military exercises to save money and expressed a hope of withdrawing troops eventually. Trump called the military exercises \"war games\" and \"provocative,\" surprising South Korea and U.S. military commanders. He mentioned saving money and potentially withdrawing the 30,000 U.S. troops in South Korea. The annual U.S.-South Korea exercises for August were canceled, with analysts noting similarities to previous agreements with North Korea. The \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises scheduled for August were cancelled. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, but critics pointed out the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. Kim's commitment to dismantle the DPRK's ballistic missile program was also questioned. The lack of a timeframe or verification mechanisms for denuclearization, along with Kim's non-commitment to dismantle the DPRK's ballistic missile program, has raised concerns. Uncertainty remains regarding the definition and sequencing of denuclearization, as well as the establishment of a peace regime and normalization of diplomatic ties. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay the process and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Veterans of past negotiations caution that North Korea may seek to prolong the process. The push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks by North Korea is seen as a tactic to stall for time and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Some warn that North Korea may try to prolong the process to ease sanction pressure. Maintaining political momentum for existing sanctions is challenging amidst engagement efforts. U.N. sanctions have been crucial in holding North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests. A total of 10 resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to implement sanctions. The UNSC imposed sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests, with a total of 10 resolutions passed between 2006 and December 2017. The sanctions targeted arms sales, materials aiding WMD programs, individuals involved in WMD activities, and luxury goods transfers. The fourth nuclear test in January 2016 led to an expansion of U.N. sanctions. Since North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, there has been a significant increase in U.N. sanctions, with six resolutions passed by December 2017. These sanctions now prohibit various financial interactions with North Korean entities, trade in specific industrial sectors, and joint ventures with North Korea in certain activities. North Korean entities are banned from trading in entire industrial sectors and engaging in various activities with other countries. This has led to a significant decline in North Korea's exports, with major items now prohibited in international markets. The Obama and Trump Administrations have also been urging countries globally to comply with these sanctions. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017 compared to 2016. The Obama and Trump Administrations pushed countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. It is unclear if the Trump Administration has continued this approach since starting diplomatic outreach in 2018. The US imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea to increase pressure. The United States has maintained an aggressive approach towards North Korea since its diplomatic outreach in 2018, leading sanctions efforts in the UNSC and imposing unilateral sanctions. Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issued executive orders targeting North Korea, with Congress passing two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015. Obama designated North Korea as a primary money laundering concern in 2016, while Trump redesignated it as a state sponsor of terrorism in 2017. The Trump Administration designated North Korea as a primary money laundering concern and a state sponsor of terrorism in 2017. Congress passed two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015, resulting in limited trade and prohibited financial transactions between the U.S. and North Korea. U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) have limited trade to humanitarian goods, prohibited financial transactions, new investments, and granted the President authority to restrict certain sectors in North Korea. Foreign aid is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the North Korean government from benefiting. U.S. individuals are prohibited from engaging in trade with North Korean entities. U.S. foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. individuals are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities, vessels, and individuals. Foreign financial institutions could face sanctions for facilitating transactions for designated DPRK entities. U.S. persons and entities are also prohibited from trading with Kim Jong-un, the Korean Workers' Party, and others. Travel to North Korea is limited and requires special validation. North Korea's demands in negotiations for ending its weapons programs have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the U.S. as prerequisites for denuclearization. Pyongyang's behavior is complex and unpredictable, making it difficult to identify consistent patterns. North Korea's behavior has been unpredictable, vacillating between limited cooperation and overt provocations such as testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. Pyongyang's willingness to negotiate is influenced by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. North Korea has a history of testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear devices, often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. Pyongyang's negotiation tactics involve exploiting divisions among parties and stalling the process during political transitions in Washington. The unpredictability of North Korea's demands raises questions about the effectiveness of negotiations. North Korea's negotiation tactics involve exploiting divisions among parties and stalling the process during political transitions in Washington. Analysts argue that negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict chances and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's goal of economic development. This vision includes a basic bargain for a more secure relationship with the United States, a formal end to the Korean War, and economic benefits. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 is seen as a sign of potential denuclearization. Analysts believe that without relief from sanctions and ending isolation, achieving economic goals will be challenging for North Korea. Many analysts believe that North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing it as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's determination to maintain its nuclear weapons is seen as a tactical move, with no intention of exchanging them for aid or recognition. North Korea's nuclear capability is crucial for regime survival, with no intention of giving it up in exchange for aid or recognition. Analysts doubt any shift in intentions despite pledges made at the Singapore summit. Pyongyang reiterated its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state in 2010 and modernized its nuclear deterrent in 2012. North Korea has repeatedly demanded recognition as a nuclear weapons state and stated that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable, even for large sums of money. The country revised its constitution in 2012 to describe itself as a \"nuclear-armed nation\" and declared the successful completion of its state nuclear force in 2017. North Korea has declared itself a nuclear-armed nation and stated that its nuclear weapons are non-negotiable. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, North Korean leaders have emphasized the importance of maintaining their nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 military intervention in Libya, which gave up its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions removal, may have reinforced the perceived value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. The 2018 Singapore summit between the U.S. and North Korea may have legitimized North Korea as a nuclear state, reinforcing the regime's belief in the value of nuclear weapons for security. The summit satisfied some of North Korea's demands, including the cancellation of joint military exercises. The 2018 Singapore summit between the U.S. and North Korea may have legitimized North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its demands such as canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. The summit conferred prestige on North Korea by meeting with other world leaders. Prior to the Trump Administration's efforts, the United States engaged in four major sets of formal nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The proposed formula for these negotiations involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected the startup of a plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon that were not subject to international monitoring. In the 1990s, North Korea obstructed IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT, leading to considerations of a preemptive military strike by the Clinton Administration. In the 1990s, North Korea obstructed IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT. A preemptive military strike was considered by the Clinton Administration. Sanctions and diplomatic efforts led to negotiations and the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework, where North Korea agreed to freeze and dismantle its plutonium program in exchange for aid. The U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework led to North Korea freezing its plutonium program in exchange for aid, including two light water reactor nuclear power plants and heavy fuel oil. Despite delays, the agreement saw North Korea complying with some commitments. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration confronted North Korea about a suspected secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of heavy fuel oil shipments and construction of light water reactors. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon site. In response to the discovery of a secret uranium enrichment program, North Korea denied its existence publicly. The United States stopped heavy fuel oil shipments and LWR construction, leading North Korea to expel IAEA inspectors, withdraw from the NPT, and restart its reactor and reprocessing facility. Additionally, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to address its missile program and exports. In 1996, the Clinton Administration started negotiations with North Korea to curb its missile program and exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to halt long-range missile testing in exchange for eased U.S. sanctions and ongoing talks. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 to finalize a deal where North Korea would stop ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international aid in launching satellites. In October 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang to finalize an agreement with North Korea to end ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international assistance in launching satellites. Despite maintaining a moratorium until July 2006, negotiations expanded under the George W. Bush Administration to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia through the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008, which ultimately failed to resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. The \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008, hosted by China, aimed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue but ultimately failed to reach a resolution despite occasional progress. In 2005, a Joint Statement was issued where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees, but the process broke down due to verification issues. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. Despite promises and talks, the process broke down due to verification disagreements. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. The main elements involved insisting on steps towards denuclearization, coordinating with Japan and South Korea, convincing China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition for negotiations. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition for negotiations. Additionally, the administration implemented multilateral and unilateral sanctions to pressure North Korea. The Obama Administration implemented sanctions, including seizing assets, to pressure North Korea following the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment attributed to North Korean hackers. Following the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014, attributed to North Korean hackers, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction, with the U.S. focusing on building consensus at the UNSC and imposing multilateral sanctions on North Korea. Following provocations by Pyongyang, the United States focused on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through enhanced multilateral sanctions. An exception was the \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012, after Kim Jong-il's death, committing North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests and missile launches in exchange for concessions. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment activities at the Yongbyon nuclear facility. In exchange, the Obama Administration pledged nutritional assistance and increased cultural exchanges with North Korea. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a third nuclear test in February 2013. The U.S. policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China for economic and diplomatic pressure. North Korea violated the \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a third nuclear test in February 2013. The U.S. relies on China for economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea, as China is its largest trading partner and provides essential aid to the regime. China's priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent its collapse. China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing fears the destabilizing effects of a humanitarian crisis, significant refugee flows, and the uncertainty of other nations' actions in a power vacuum. China also values North Korea as a strategic buffer between itself and democratic, U.S.-allied South Korea. China values North Korea as a strategic buffer and is concerned about the uncertainty of other nations' actions in a power vacuum. Beijing often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums, such as the U.N. Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions against North Korea, and the Chinese government's enforcement of sanctions is inconsistent. China's seat on the UNSC often hinders U.S. efforts to punish North Korea. Chinese companies violate sanctions, and China's enforcement is inconsistent. In 2017, China increased enforcement, possibly to deter U.S. military action. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited compared to potential support. The United States is cautious not to provoke China into providing more support to North Korea, as Beijing's trade and aid to Pyongyang are limited. This approach aims to prevent China from feeling compelled to offer more assistance, given strained relations since Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011. The U.S. and South Korean approach aims to avoid pushing China to provide more assistance to North Korea. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with Chinese displeasure towards Kim Jong-un escalating after the execution of his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping had summits with South Korean Presidents but did not meet with Kim, while Chinese academics called for a reassessment of China's ties with North Korea. President Xi Jinping had summits with South Korean Presidents but did not meet with Kim. Chinese academics called for a reassessment of China's ties with North Korea. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. China agreed to increasingly stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions in 2017. In 2017, Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. State censors regularly deleted content ridiculing Pyongyang's leadership. China agreed to strict UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved the North Korea-China relationship. Kim traveled to Beijing before meeting Trump, indicating a desire to strengthen ties with China. After Trump's agreement to meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader visited Beijing to reaffirm the close relationship with China. This move followed some perceived victories for China, including deescalation of hostilities and the cancellation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Kim's actions likely earned him goodwill and leverage in his relationship with Beijing. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, has gained new goodwill and leverage with Beijing after the cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Kim's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 may reveal more about the Pyongyang regime's priorities. Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s, has consolidated power at the apex of the North Korean regime. He has pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons development, aiming to ensure regime survival and improve the country's struggling economy. Kim Jong-un has successfully pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons development, aiming to ensure regime survival and improve the country's struggling economy. He has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and launched a charm offensive to restore relations with South Korea and China, while also making a temporary breakthrough with the United States to avoid more sanctions. Kim Jong-un has pursued economic opportunities through a \"charm offensive\" with South Korea and China, avoiding harsher sanctions from the United States. Despite initial hopes for political reform, Kim's ruthless consolidation of power shows his commitment to maintaining the dictatorship. Since taking power in 2011, he has executed senior officials to assert his control. Kim Jong-un's drive to consolidate power is evident in his brutal leadership style, including purges of senior officials and alleged involvement in assassinations. Over 300 military and civilian officials were replaced in his first four years in office, showcasing his determination to maintain the dynastic dictatorship. Kim Jong-un's leadership style differs from his father's, allowing Western influences and displaying a more informal demeanor in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, a stark change from his father's era. Kim Jong-un has embraced Western influences and displayed informality in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, while their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as Kim's attempt to appear young and modern, evoking his grandfather's \"man of the people\" image. North Korea remains one of the world's poorest countries. Kim Jong-un is trying to appear young and modern, following his grandfather's image. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, has seen some economic growth under Kim's leadership. Increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities may explain this progress. Kim Jong-un's economic reforms have led to improved living standards for many North Koreans, with increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities helping the country withstand international sanctions. Market principles have been partially allowed to govern certain sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture. Kim Jong-un's economic reforms have allowed market principles to govern some sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture, leading to the legalization of consumer and business-to-business markets. This shift has resulted in an expansion of markets and ancillary services, with a focus on domestic manufacturing and a move towards consuming domestically produced goods. Kim Jong-un emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift to consuming domestically produced goods. International trade with China accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests since 2010. Food prices in North Korea have been stable since around 2012. Since 2010, North Korea has seen larger harvests due to agricultural changes and favorable planting conditions. Despite stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered reforms. The North Korea Resident Coordinator estimates that over 10 million North Koreans, or over 40% of the population, continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered reforms, as the government's willingness to tolerate marketization is uncertain. The North Korean government prohibits private enterprise and periodically cracks down on market activity. Many North Koreans lack access to healthcare and face food shortages, despite the regime's claims of providing universal healthcare. In Pyongyang, healthcare facilities are better, but only the elite have access. The regime controls where families can live. In Pyongyang, health facilities are better than in the rest of the country, but only the elite have access. The regime tightly controls who can reside in and enter the capital, limiting access to quality medical care for many North Koreans. Pyongyang is struggling to control information flows from the outside world into North Korea, as revealed by surveys of North Korean defectors. North Koreans struggle to afford medications and bribes for doctors, leading to limited access to quality medical care. Pyongyang is losing control over information flows, with citizens turning to outside news sources despite government efforts to jam foreign broadcasts. Some citizens possess illegal radios to access outside information. The North Korean government attempts to block its citizens from listening to foreign broadcasts by jamming stations like VOA, RFA, and the BBC. Despite efforts to alter radios, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to access foreign programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017, allowing increased mobile-phone use. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009 in cooperation with Orascom, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance. Some reports suggest North Korean cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls. Phone conversations are monitored, but cell phones enable faster communication. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls, despite being illegal in North Korea. The spread of cell phones allows for faster dissemination of information, potentially leading to positive changes in the political system. A 2015 survey found that 28% of North Koreans owned domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. Increased access to information through cell phones in North Korea could potentially lead to positive changes in the political system. A 2015 survey revealed that 28% of North Koreans owned domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that outside sources of information could weaken the regime's control over its citizens indoctrinated to believe in the superiority of North Korea. The North Korean regime has indoctrinated its citizens for decades to instill loyalty to the Kim family and portray the outside world as inferior. The country has one of the largest militaries globally, with significant defense spending. North Korea has one of the largest militaries globally, with 1.28 million personnel in uniform and 600,000 in reserves. Defense spending may account for 24% of the country's national income. The military has deployed most of its ground, air, and naval forces near the DMZ for rapid deployment in a conflict with South Korea. North Korea is focusing on developing its WMD capabilities to compensate for deficiencies in its conventional forces, particularly nuclear weapons. North Korea is prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional military forces. Pyongyang also possesses a significant stockpile of chemical weapons and potentially biological weapons. The U.S. intelligence community has identified North Korea as one of the top cyber threats to the United States in 2018. North Korea has developed offensive cyber operations capabilities and is considered one of the top cyber threats to the United States in 2018. South Korea's Defense Ministry reports North Korea has 6,000 cyber warfare troops. Despite outdated military equipment, North Korea could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have declined since 1990, but they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts believe the U.S. and South Korea would ultimately prevail in a war on the Korean Peninsula, despite the potential costs. North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a conflict, but their equipment is outdated compared to the U.S. and South Korean militaries. North Korea's artillery forces, based in underground facilities, could launch thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a conflict. Despite having outdated equipment compared to the U.S. and South Korea, North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years. This includes unmanned aerial vehicles, offensive cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, stealth technology, and electromagnetic pulse weapons. North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years, including advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. They have also constructed new helicopter-carrier corvettes and may be developing a larger model of submarine for launching ballistic missiles. North Korea has developed surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command and control structure, limiting independent actions. War plans are rigid and mid-level officers lack training and authority. North Korean military's command and control structure is highly centralized, with rigid and inflexible war plans. General resource scarcity affects military readiness, including lack of fuel for training, logistical shortages, lack of spare parts, and food shortages. U.S. analysts remain concerned about these issues. The North Korean military faces challenges such as flight training and logistical shortages, lack of spare parts, and food shortages. U.S. analysts are concerned about the pace of North Korea's nuclear weapons development and skepticism towards denuclearization talks. The United States is in talks with North Korea about abandoning its nuclear weapons program, but the intelligence community is skeptical of Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize. North Korea's commitment to possessing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles suggests they do not intend to negotiate them away. North Korean regime's focus on fielding long-range missiles and emphasizing the importance of nuclear weapons for its survival indicates a reluctance to negotiate them away. Choe Son Hui stated that North Korea's nuclear arsenal is crucial for deterring US attacks, with a commitment to developing smaller, lighter, and more diverse warheads through multiple nuclear tests since 2006. North Korea has been building its nuclear force with a focus on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads. They have conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb in September 2017. North Korea announced in early 2018 that they had achieved their goals and would no longer conduct nuclear tests. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. By early 2018, North Korea announced the cessation of nuclear tests and closure of its test site, but fissile material production continues. North Korea's nuclear program started in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a research program near Yongbyon. They built a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium and a reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent fuel. The reactor and reprocessing facility have been alternately operational and frozen under safeguards since 1994. North Korea has restarted its 5MW(e) reactor and reprocessing plant, built a uranium enrichment plant, and is constructing a new experimental light water reactor. Estimates suggest they have produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium. North Korea has built a uranium enrichment plant and is constructing a new experimental light water reactor. Estimates suggest they have produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. Intelligence in the late 1990s pointed to a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium (HEU). North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, claiming it is for nuclear power production. In November 2010, North Korea showed American experts early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor. North Korea acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009 for nuclear power production. In November 2010, they displayed construction of a light-water reactor and a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. Reports in July 2018 identified a clandestine enrichment facility at Kangson. U.S. officials suspect other undisclosed enrichment sites exist. North Korea's clandestine enrichment facilities have not been independently confirmed, with U.S. officials suspecting the existence of other undisclosed sites. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Recent scholarly analyses suggest North Korea could produce 20 to 100 warheads by 2020 based on fissile material production estimates. North Korea prioritizes developing ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since 2011 to enhance offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. Estimates suggest they could have 20 to 100 warheads by 2020 based on fissile material production. Since 2011, North Korea has conducted over 80 ballistic missile test launches to improve offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests, and in 2017, they test launched 18 ballistic missiles, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles. North Korea has conducted multiple ballistic missile test launches since 2011, with a focus on improving offensive capabilities and evading U.S. missile defense systems. They have around 700 short-range ballistic missiles and are working towards developing a miniaturized nuclear warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. The accuracy of their antiquated missiles limits their military effectiveness. North Korea is developing a miniaturized nuclear warhead for long-range ballistic missiles, with assessments differing on progress. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and U.S. military bases. Experts believe North Korea may have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. A 2015 Department of Defense report identifies hypothetical ICBMs that North Korea could use to deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. North Korea has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 are identified as potential ICBMs for delivering a nuclear warhead to the U.S. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of these ICBMs, and in 2017, conducted two ICBM tests. North Korea has shown progress in its ICBM program, with two tests conducted in 2017. The country is also advancing in its MRBM and SLBM programs, and is transitioning towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles. North Korea is advancing in its ballistic missile programs, including medium-range and submarine-launched missiles. They are transitioning to solid rocket motors for their missiles, which offer stability and faster reaction times. Recent tests of the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM led to plans for mass production. North Korea is also focusing on developing capabilities to counter missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. North Korea's recent ballistic missile tests aim to defeat missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD by launching missiles at higher altitudes and steeper angles, making interception more challenging. North Korea's ballistic missile tests aim to defeat missile defense systems by launching missiles at higher altitudes and steeper angles, making interception more challenging. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially complicating interception efforts. Their progress with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) may be a strategy to counter land-based missile defenses like THAAD. North Korea's progress with SLBMs could challenge missile defense systems by launching attacks from sea, potentially countering land-based THAAD defenses. The United States has tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program since its first long-range missile test in 1998. The United States has attempted to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program since 1998, but negotiations were abandoned during the Bush Administration. Ballistic missiles were not discussed in the Six-Party Talks, and in 2006, UNSC Resolution 1718 barred North Korea from further missile testing. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over negotiations on ballistic missiles. UNSC Resolution 1718 in 2006 prohibited North Korea from missile activities, but they defied it with a 2009 test launch. Resolution 1874 imposed more restrictions on their ballistic missile program. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on missile tests, but North Korea argued it didn't cover satellite launches. Recent talks have not focused on missiles. North Korea has an active biological and chemical weapons program, with one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. Reports estimate they have around 12 weapons. North Korea possesses one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. Estimates suggest they have around 12 facilities for production and storage, with a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year and 12,000 tons during a crisis. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense reports a current inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea has a significant chemical weapon production capability, estimated at 4,500 metric tons in a typical year and 12,000 tons during a crisis. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense reports an inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and could target South Korea and Japan with chemical weapons. North Korea's chemical weapons capability poses a threat to South Korea and Japan, as it is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The country is suspected of also having biological weapons production capabilities, according to U.S. intelligence assessments. North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability and infrastructure to support it, with a munitions production capacity for weaponizing biological agents. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense estimated in 2012 that North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox. North Korea has also proliferated WMD and missile-related technology and expertise, selling missile parts and technology to several countries. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile technology is a serious concern for the United States. Pyongyang has sold missile parts and technology to multiple countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Sales of missiles have been a key source of revenue for the Kim regime. North Korea has assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor, destroyed by Israel in 2007, which may have been part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Panel of Experts has reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. North Korea and Iran have also cooperated. The U.N. Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. North Korea and Iran have cooperated on missile development since the 1980s, with assistance from China. Iran's ballistic missile research centers' advisors were seen in North Korea before the December 2012 launch. Missile research centers in North Korea were observed before the December 2012 launch, potentially contributing to its success. China may have supported North Korea's missile program, with evidence of a Chinese company selling heavy transport vehicles to North Korea for missile purposes. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn currency for weapons programs, utilizing a global network of entities. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn currency for weapons programs, utilizing a global network of entities. One agency, Office 39, oversees many of these activities, including drug trafficking and counterfeit currency production. These activities serve as a source of foreign currency for the regime. North Korea's Office 39 oversees illicit activities like drug trafficking, generating $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies smuggling networks. Tighter sanctions have led to increased narcotics production since 2017. North Korea has been involved in smuggling 100 kg of methamphetamines into the United States, possibly due to tighter sanctions. It is unclear if these activities are directed by the state or local criminal gangs. The country also sells Cold War-era weapons to states in the Middle East and North Africa. North Korea is a provider of cheap Cold War-era weapons, selling arms to states in the Middle East and North Africa. In August 2016, a ship carrying over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades was seized outside the Suez Canal, allegedly destined for the Egyptian military. North Korea has cooperated with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles with Iran and supplying weapons to Syria. North Korea uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. These companies, often set up with the help of North Korean diplomats, keep the regime's earnings in overseas bank accounts instead of repatriating the funds to North Korea. Some Chinese companies, with the assistance of North Korean diplomats, help the regime keep its earnings in overseas bank accounts to avoid repatriating funds to North Korea. They use front companies in various locations to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars for a sanctioned North Korean bank. The U.S. government has been sanctioning such companies, with the Treasury Department banning a Chinese entity in November 2017. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies assisting the North Korean regime in conducting transactions in U.S. dollars. In November 2017, the Treasury Department banned a Chinese bank, Bank of Dandong, for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activity. In the past, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for the regime. The Department froze $24 million in North Korean accounts with the bank. In September 2005, the Treasury Department identified Banco Delta Asia in Macau as a bank distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for criminal enterprises. $24 million in North Korean accounts with the bank were frozen, leading to a North Korean boycott of Six-Party Talks. Past Administrations have highlighted North Korea's poor human rights record, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. The State Department's annual human rights report emphasizes the dire situation for most North Koreans. The State Department's annual human rights reports and reports from private organizations have consistently highlighted North Korea's extreme human rights abuses. These include a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties, with no freedoms of speech, press, or assembly, and no independent judiciary. Citizens do not have the right to choose their leaders. Reports on North Korea highlight the denial of political, civil, and religious liberties, absence of freedoms of speech and press, lack of independent judiciary, and extensive ideological indoctrination. Severe physical abuse is inflicted on citizens who violate laws, with roughly 100,000 political prisoners held in prison camps. North Korea operates prison camps (kwanliso) housing around 100,000 political prisoners, including family members. There are reportedly four kwanliso camps with harsh conditions where many do not survive. Reports from survivors and escapees indicate extreme abuse. Reports from survivors and escapees reveal harsh conditions in North Korea's prison camps, with close to 400,000 prisoners perishing due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The number of political prisoners has decreased, likely due to high mortality rates in the camps. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with the creation of the Special Rapporteur on human rights in 2004 and the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry in 2013 to investigate the country's conditions. The number of political prisoners in North Korea has decreased in recent years, possibly due to high mortality rates in the camps. The UN established the Commission of Inquiry in 2013 to investigate human rights violations in North Korea. The commission found that the North Korean regime had committed \"crimes against humanity.\" The Commission of Inquiry found that the North Korean regime committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommended referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. Despite a resolution in 2014, no further action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. The Assembly recommended referring North Korea to the ICC, but no action has been taken due to China and Russia's resistance. The U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository for evidence of human rights violations in North Korea. Thousands of North Koreans have fled to China to escape persecution and food shortages. Thousands of North Koreans have fled to China in the past two decades due to food shortages, persecution, and human rights abuses. They face further abuse and lack of protection, with women and children often becoming victims of human trafficking. If repatriated, they risk harsh punishment or execution. The UNHCR has not been allowed to conduct a systematic survey in North Korea. Reports indicate that many women and children are victims of human trafficking, particularly women lured to China seeking a better life but forced into marriage or prostitution. Some refugees who escape to China make their way to Southeast Asia, seeking passage to a third country, usually South Korea. Over 30,000 North Koreans have resettled in South Korea, with a recent decline in defectors. In 2017, 1,127 North Koreans came to South Korea\u2014a 21% decrease from 2016. In South Korea, all North Korean defectors receive citizenship. The number of defectors has declined, with 1,127 North Koreans arriving in 2017, a 21% decrease from 2016. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted the changing profile of defectors. The decrease may be due to tightened border patrols. The changing demographic profile of North Korean defectors has seen a decrease in overall numbers since Kim Jong-un's rule, but an increase in defectors with good songbun. This shift may be due to heightened border security, making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Diplomats, responsible for earning foreign currency, may fear returning to North Korea if unable to meet expectations, leading some to defect instead. Elite defectors face greater consequences if caught. Since the late 2000s, diplomats have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the regime, leading some to defect to avoid returning to North Korea. Elite defectors risk being imprisoned or executed, with many fleeing to China where between 50,000 and 200,000 escapees are in hiding. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry in February 2014 implicated China for repatriating defectors, suggesting Chinese officials could be complicit in crimes against humanity. China has been actively cooperating with the North Korean regime to repatriate defectors, with Chinese officials accused of aiding crimes against humanity. China has intensified its crackdown on North Korean refugees, repatriating them despite violating the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. The Chinese government labels defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them instead of granting asylum. China, despite signing the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, considers North Korean defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them, citing a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting the refugees is also illegal in China, but defectors who reach foreign embassies or consulates are allowed to leave the country. The Chinese government considers North Korean defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them under a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting refugees is illegal in China, but those who reach foreign embassies or consulates are allowed to leave the country. Beijing maintains this policy to preserve ties with North Korea, treating the refugee issue seriously like China's stance on Taiwan. The fear of allowing refugees into China also influences Beijing's cautious approach. The Chinese government treats the refugee issue seriously, similar to its stance on Taiwan. Beijing fears that allowing North Korean refugees into China could lead to social and political destabilization in its northeastern provinces and potentially cause the collapse of the North Korean regime. In 2004, Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act to support human rights in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004 to support human rights efforts in North Korea. It authorized new funds and called for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be linked to human rights improvements in the country. The act also required the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, a position that was later folded into the responsibilities of the Under Secretary of State. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004 to support human rights efforts in North Korea. It required the appointment of a \"Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea,\" which was later folded into the responsibilities of the Under Secretary of State. The act allows North Koreans to apply for asylum in the United States, with Congress reauthorizing it in 2008, 2012, and 2018. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was reauthorized by Congress in 2008, 2012, and 2018. The 2018 reauthorization bill emphasized increasing freedom of information into North Korea and enhancing efforts to process North Korean refugees in third countries. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. The 2018 reauthorization bill, H.R. 2061, focused on increasing freedom of information in North Korea and improving the working conditions of overseas North Korean laborers. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently highlighted North Korea's overseas-labor program. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program, where workers face conditions of forced labor akin to \"state-sponsored slavery.\" Workers toil long hours, up to 20 hours a day, under exploitative conditions, with their families monitored by government minders back in North Korea. North Korean workers abroad face exploitative conditions, working up to 20 hours a day with government minders monitoring their families back home. The regime takes a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions annually to prop up the country's economy. This labor program has been ongoing for decades, with workers sent to various countries since the 1960s. North Korea's overseas-labor program has a long history, with workers sent to Russia, Africa, and the Middle East since the 1960s. There are about 50,000 to 80,000 North Koreans working overseas, mainly in Russia and China. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to send these workers home by 2019. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to expel North Korean laborers by 2019. Congress passed a law prohibiting North Korean goods from entering the US and sanctioning foreign entities using North Korean forced labor. The US provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008. The US provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with aid for food and energy. Assistance stopped in early 2009, tied to progress in the Six-Party Talks. Technical assistance was also provided for nuclear disablement. In 2008, Congress enabled the President to provide expanded assistance to North Korea for nuclear disablement. However, after North Korea's actions in 2009, including missile tests and halting denuclearization activities, Congress rejected the Obama Administration's requests for additional funds. U.S. food aid to North Korea ended. In 2009, North Korea tested a nuclear device, halted denuclearization activities, and expelled nuclear inspectors. U.S. food aid to North Korea ended due to disagreements over monitoring. North Korea has periodically appealed for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided food aid for young children, pregnant mothers, and the elderly. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement aimed to provide 240,000 metric tons of food aid for young children, pregnant mothers, and the elderly. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are \"unaccounted-for,\" with efforts made in the 1990s to discuss their recovery with North Korean officials and Members of Congress. In 1992, North Korean officials engaged with Senator Bob Smith to discuss recovering U.S. POW-MIAs. By 1996, joint investigations were agreed upon to find remains of missing U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. 33 joint investigations were conducted from 1996 to 2005, resulting in the recovery of 229 sets of remains. The U.S. military and Korean People's Army conducted 33 joint investigations from 1996 to 2005 to find remains of missing U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. Despite recovering 229 sets of remains and identifying 107, operations in North Korea faced difficulties. The program was suspended in 2005 due to North Korea's actions related to nuclear weapons and the NPT. In May 2005, the DOD suspended Joint Field Activities with North Korea due to concerns about North Korea's nuclear intentions and safety issues for U.S. search teams. The DOD had provided over $20 million for recovery efforts between 1996 and 2005. Talks resumed in 2011, leading to an agreement in October 2011. In January 2012, DOD announced preparations for a return mission to North Korea. In 2011, talks between the United States and North Korea resumed for a joint recovery program with over $20 million in assistance. However, in March 2012, the joint mission was suspended due to North Korea's rocket launch announcement. The United States has not engaged in Joint Field Activities with North Korea since May 2005. In March 2012, doubts arose about North Korea's commitments, leading to the suspension of joint missions. North Korean state media warned in October 2014 about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains, signaling a desire for broader negotiations with the U.S. The Department of Defense prioritizes the recovery of missing U.S. soldiers' remains from the Korean War. Trump and Kim discussed these issues in June. The Department of Defense and North Korea have prioritized the recovery of missing U.S. soldiers' remains from the Korean War. Trump and Kim committed to recovering POW/MIA remains at the June 2018 Singapore summit. North Korea turned over 55 cases of remains to the U.S. military for repatriation and examination by the DPAA. In late July, North Korea handed over 55 cases of remains to the U.S. military for repatriation and examination by the DPAA. North Korea's delay in transferring the remains was reportedly due to a request for payment, which the United States does not provide. The largest proportion of aid to North Korea since the mid-1990s famines has come from government contributions to emergency relief programs. Some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts despite turbulent relations between governments. NGOs play smaller roles in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges in various sectors. Some U.S.-based NGOs have good working relationships with North Korean counterparts, operating through periods of tension. These NGOs have diverse aims, including joint ventures in informal diplomacy and humanitarian aid efforts in North Korea. Several religious NGOs engage in informal diplomacy and provide aid to vulnerable sectors of the North Korean population. Their ancillary goal is to promote peaceful relations with North Korea through stronger people-to-people ties, but they have faced challenges due to tighter U.S. and international sanctions since 2016. The DPRK operations have been hindered by U.S. sanctions and restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea since 2016. The June 12 Trump-Kim Jong-un Summit and various reports by CRS on North Korea's nuclear programs, military options, economic sanctions, and cyber capabilities.
