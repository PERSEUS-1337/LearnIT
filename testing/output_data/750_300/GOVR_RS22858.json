    "content": "This report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). In FY2017, Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies were set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). FY2018 funding levels for DOE were established by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). Funding history comparison covers 71 years (FY1948-FY2018) for DOE and predecessor agencies. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) set final funding for DOE programs in FY2018. Funding levels for DOE in real terms since 1978 are shown in Figure 1, while Table 1 displays cumulative funding totals for the past 10, 41, and 71 years. Table 2 presents relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. The funding totals in real terms for the past 10, 41, and 71 years are displayed in Table 1. Table 2 converts this data into relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show pie charts illustrating the cumulative DOE spending for different periods. Energy availability, especially liquid fuels like gasoline, has been crucial. During the post-World War II era, the federal government applied research and development to energy sources for economic growth, focusing on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The availability of energy, particularly liquid fuels like gasoline, played a critical role in World War II. Research and development were also applied to military technologies, including the atomic bomb. During the post-World War II era, the federal government focused on R&D for energy sources, including fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian nuclear power. AEC's research included \"atoms for peace,\" promoting nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was established to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian nuclear power. The AEC focused on research for \"atoms for peace,\" promoting nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration was created, followed by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating the activities of the FEA and ERDA. The Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was established in 1975, incorporating various energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) was created in 1977, merging activities of the FEA and ERDA. DOE consolidated all energy R&D programs, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Total federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies from FY1948 to FY1977. The federal government focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies in energy R&D from FY1948 to FY1977, spending $17.1 billion on fossil energy and $51.6 billion on nuclear energy in constant FY2016 dollars. The energy crises of the 1970s led to the expansion of R&D programs to include renewable energy sources. The federal government expanded its energy R&D programs in response to the energy crises of the 1970s, including support for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. DOE became the main funder of energy R&D since FY1978, with funding for all energy technologies peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been the primary funder of energy research and development (R&D) compared to other federal agencies. Funding for energy technologies peaked at $8.6 billion in FY1979, then dropped to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding gradually increased, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE's energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion."
