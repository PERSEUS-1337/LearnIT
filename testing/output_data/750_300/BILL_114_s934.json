    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for volumes of cellulosic biofuel under the Clean Air Act. The estimation method for projected volumes is specified in the amendment. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act, specifying the method for projections by the Energy Information Administration. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities producing biofuel from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities based on actual monthly production. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities based on average monthly production to determine annualized production for the current year. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities based on average monthly production to determine annual production for the current year. For each cellulosic biofuel production facility starting production after January 1 of the current year, specific requirements apply. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities based on average monthly production to determine annual production for the current year. Specific requirements apply to new cellulosic biofuel production facilities starting production after January 1 of the current year, including determining the average monthly volume produced. The curr_chunk is about the production of cellulosic biofuel by a facility from the date of initial production until October 31 of the current calendar year. The facility will determine the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for the current calendar year based on the average monthly production volume. Total production estimate for the following calendar year of cellulosic biofuel production is based on the projected volume from all production facilities. The estimated annual volumes of cellulosic biofuel production for all facilities are described for the current calendar year. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include using exact volumes and requiring reductions in applicable volume. Amendments to the Clean Air Act involve using exact volumes for cellulosic biofuel production and requiring the same volume reductions. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify that the term \"cellulosic biofuel\" excludes compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and electricity from biogas produced from landfills or wastewater treatment facilities. The final rule of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency regulates cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways, including biogas production from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and municipal solid waste digesters. Regulation of cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard will not have force or effect if they conflict with amendments made by subsection (c). The EPA must reissue rules to align with amendments made by subsection (c) regarding cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volumes in the Clean Air Act will be adjusted. The Clean Air Act will be adjusted to align with amendments regarding cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volumes in the Act will be revised."
