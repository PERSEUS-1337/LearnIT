    "content": "Neural networks struggle to generalize transformations outside of their training data, limiting their ability to extrapolate accurately. A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this issue by learning how neurons encode edits for improved out-of-sample generation. Neuron editing is a technique that learns how neurons encode edits for transformations in a latent space, allowing for complex data transformations with simpler distribution shifts. Neuron editing involves defining editing transformations on neurons in a latent space to encode complex data transformations with simpler distribution shifts. This technique is showcased in image domain/style transfer and biological applications such as removing batch artifacts and predicting drug synergy. Experiments in biology often study the effects of treatments or conditions on samples, like groups of cells and drug administration. Mathematically modeling the effects and interactions of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs is crucial in biology experiments and clinical trials. Typically, experiments are conducted on a small subset of samples, assuming generalizability without considering context-specific interactions. However, incorporating background information into mathematical models would provide a powerful tool for assessing treatment effects. Neural networks offer a powerful method for learning a general edit function corresponding to treatment in the biological setting, allowing assessment of treatment generalization beyond measured samples. Neural networks offer the power to learn an edit function for treatment in the biological setting, allowing generalization beyond measured samples. The approach reframes the problem as learning an edit function between pre-and post-treatment data versions, termed neuron editing. Neural networks can learn an edit function for treatment in the biological setting, termed neuron editing. This involves training an autoencoder on the entire population of data to transform pre-and post-treatment data versions. The edit function is learned in the latent space of the autoencoder neural network with non-linear activations. The autoencoder neural network transforms pre-and post-treatment data by decomposing variation into abstract features. Neuron editing extracts differences in activation distributions to generate synthetic post-treatment data. This process encodes complex edits in a multivariate space. The autoencoder neural network decomposes variation into abstract features, while neuron editing extracts differences in activation distributions to generate synthetic post-treatment data. This process encodes complex edits in a multivariate space, leveraging the autoencoder's key advantages. In this work, the focus is on using neuron editing in the latent space of an autoencoder to model complex distribution-to-distribution transformations between large samples in high-dimensional space. Research suggests that working in a lower-dimensional manifold facilitates learning transformations that would otherwise be infeasible in the original ambient space. Research has shown that working in a lower-dimensional manifold with autoencoders can simplify complex effects into simpler shifts in distribution, making computations more efficient. Editing neural network internal layers allows for modeling context dependence. By editing neural network internal layers, complex context dependencies can be modeled, with some neurons showing drastic changes post-treatment while others encoding background context information remain unchanged. These edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in predictive ways. The editing of neurons in the embedding layer influences the output along with data-context-encoding neurons. Editing in a low-dimensional internal layer allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, avoiding noise. This approach may provide more predictive results for treatment compared to assuming widespread generalization of results context-free. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. This editing assumes semantic consistency across data manifolds, which is supported by the joint manifold learned by the autoencoder. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. This editing assumes semantic consistency across data manifolds, supported by the joint manifold learned by the autoencoder. The autoencoder learns a joint manifold of all given data, including pre-and post-treatment samples of the experimental subpopulation and pre-treatment samples from the rest of the population. Neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs, even with the capacity to do so. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, with predicted changes on extrapolated data closely resembling those on interpolated data. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. The editing process produces more complex variation by preserving existing data variation, unlike generative models that need to learn to create it. Comparisons are made with traditional GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN in different applications.

Neuron editing is compared to generation-based approaches like GANs, showing their struggle with certain criteria. The benefits of neuron editing during inference are highlighted by comparing it to a regularized autoencoder. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. The method is compared to a regularized autoencoder that performs internal layer transformations during training. The extrapolation problem is motivated by attempting natural image domain transfer on the CelebA dataset and in biological applications like correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. In biological applications, extrapolation is crucial for correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. GANs learn a transformation that aligns source and target distributions, with ReLU or leaky ReLU activations commonly used for this purpose. GANs learn a transformation to align source and target distributions, often using ReLU or leaky ReLU activations. The optimization paradigm produces piecewise linear transformations, but they do not behave comparably on both source and target distributions. Instead of learning this transformation directly, a transformation is defined in a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into high-level features. Instead of directly learning a transformation, a transformation is defined in a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into high-level features. This transformation is applied to distributions of activations from source and target inputs. The text discusses a piecewise linear transformation called NeuronEdit applied to distributions of activations from source and target inputs in a neural network. This transformation is defined in a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into high-level features. The NeuronEdit function operates on distributions of activations in a neural network, transforming input activation distributions based on the difference between source and target distributions. It has properties similar to a GAN generator. The NeuronEdit function transforms input activation distributions in a neural network based on the difference between source and target distributions. It has properties similar to a GAN generator and guarantees the same editing on source and extrapolation distributions. The NeuronEdit function ensures consistent editing on source and extrapolation distributions by applying learned transformations without further training. The nomenclature of an autoencoder no longer strictly applies, as allowing training with transformed neuron activations could lead to undoing the transformations. The transformed outputX is obtained by applying neuron editing without further training, turning an autoencoder into a generative model. This allows for modeling variation in X unsupervisedly and exclusive utilization of data in S and T for GAN training. Training a GAN in this scenario can exclusively use data from S and T, as there are no real examples of the output for X. Neuron editing can model the intrinsic variation in X unsupervisedly, providing more information since X differs substantially from S. GANs are difficult to train due to issues like oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. GANs are notoriously tricky to train due to issues like oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse, where the discriminator struggles to detect differences in real and fake distributions. Mode collapse occurs when the generator produces the same point for most inputs, regardless of variability. Neuron editing avoids the struggles of GANs by learning an unsupervised model of the data space with an easier-to-train autoencoder, addressing the issue of the generator favoring ellipsoid output over the natural variability of real data. Neuron editing overcomes GANs' limitations by using an unsupervised autoencoder to model data space. It isolates variations in neuron activations to generate output, similar to word2vec embeddings in NLP. Neuron editing is a more complex extension of word2vec's vector arithmetic, transforming entire distributions instead of single points. It is compared to neuron interference as an editing method. Neuron editing is compared to various generating methods like a regularized autoencoder, a standard GAN, a ResnetGAN, and a CycleGAN. The regularized autoencoder penalizes differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy BID0 BID8. The image experiment used convolutional layers with specific filters, while other models used fully connected layers. The experiment compared neuron editing to other generating methods using different layer configurations and activation functions. Training was conducted with minibatches and the adam optimizer, focusing on a motivational experiment with the CelebA dataset. When training with minibatches and the adam optimizer, a motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset was conducted using optimizer BID16 and a learning rate of 0.001. The approach of collecting images of people with different hair colors to teach a generative model has limitations in extrapolating beyond the collected images, as shown in FIG1. The approach of training a generative model on images with different hair colors has limitations in extrapolating beyond the collected data. GAN models struggle to successfully apply transformations to out-of-sample data, as shown in FIG1. The GAN models struggle to model transformations on out-of-sample data, especially in changing hair color for females with black hair. The regular GAN model produces artifacts due to training difficulties, highlighting the benefits of stable training methods like autoencoders for neuron editing. Neuron editing involves transforming the internal layer of a neural network, focusing on complex transformations like changing hair color in a piecewise linear manner. This method showcases the ability to learn distribution transformations based on separate source/target pairs. Neuron editing can transform the internal layer of a neural network in a piecewise linear manner, showcasing its ability to learn distribution transformations. Another application is batch correction, which addresses differences in observed data caused by technical artifacts, a common issue in biological experimental data. Batch effects are a common issue in biological experimental data, leading to different datasets when measuring the same sample multiple times. Addressing batch effects is a goal of many new models, including deep learning methods. One method to tackle this issue is to repeatedly measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation in its version of the control. One method for addressing batch effects in biological experimental data is to repeatedly measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation in its version of the control. This approach can help remove variation induced by the measurement process, allowing for a more accurate comparison of samples. The dataset investigated in this section comes from a mass cytometry experiment measuring proteins in cells from two individuals infected with dengue virus. Control and sample groups have different numbers of observations, and the samples were measured in separate runs, creating variation between them. The data consists of 35 dimensions with varying numbers of observations in Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2. Technical artifacts and true biological differences create variation between the two samples. A batch effect in Control1 shows artificially low readings for the protein InfG. The model aims to identify and compensate for this variation without losing other biological differences in Sample1. The model aims to compensate for the batch effect in Control1, specifically the low readings of protein InfG, without losing other biological differences in Sample1. However, the GANs and CycleGAN fail to capture the true biological variation in Sample1, as they remove the variation in protein CCR6, mapping most cells to the same values. The GANs and CycleGAN fail to capture the true biological variation in Sample1 by mapping most cells to the same values of CCR6 and InfG, leading to loss of important information. The ResnetGAN also does not address this issue due to the generation objective focusing on output similar to the target distribution. The ResnetGAN fails to address the issue of capturing true biological variation in Sample1, as it focuses on producing output similar to the target distribution, resulting in ellipsoid data and loss of original source distribution variation. In contrast, the regularized autoencoder preserves the original data by undoing transformations in its latent space. Neuron editing separates controls and increases InfG. The regularized autoencoder preserves original data by undoing transformations in its latent space, while neuron editing separates controls and increases InfG to remove batch effects. Unlike other generative models, neuron editing accurately produces intended transformations for proteins InfG and CCR6. Neuron editing accurately produces intended transformations for proteins InfG and CCR6, confirmed globally across all dimensions. PCA embedding in FIG2 shows accurate correspondence between controls and post-transformation samples, preserving intra-sample variation. The transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors the transformation applied to Sample1, preserving intra-sample variation. Global assessments in FIG2 show accurate correspondence between controls and edited samples, reflecting the transformations produced by neuron editing. Additionally, biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is considered. The dataset analyzed includes cells from a combinatorial drug experiment on patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The results show a batch effect that needs correction in IFNg, while true variation in CCR6 should be preserved. GANs attempt to eliminate sources of variation but only do so partially. Neuron editing corrects batch effect in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under four treatments: no treatment (basal), BEZ-235 (Bez), Dasatinib (Das), and both Bez and Das (Bez+Das). Measurements from mass cytometry on 41 dimensions with datasets of varying observations. In a study on biological variation in CCR6, different treatments were applied to cells, including BEZ-235 (Bez), Dasatinib (Das), and both Bez and Das (Bez+Das). Mass cytometry was used to measure 41 dimensions, with varying numbers of observations in each dataset. The effects of applying Das to cells previously treated with Bez were predicted, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 but no change in pSTATS. The study predicted the effects of applying Das to cells previously treated with Bez, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 without changing pSTATS. Neuron editing accurately modeled this horizontal change, while the regularized autoencoder did not alter the output. None of the three GAN models accurately predicted the real combination. The regularized autoencoder and three GAN models did not accurately predict the real combination, with the ResnetGAN also facing similar issues despite residual connections. The original within-Bez variability was lost, and the models struggled to mimic the target distribution. Despite residual connections, the ResnetGAN still struggles to accurately mimic the target distribution. Neuron editing is used to evaluate if meaningful transformations are produced globally. Comparisons of every dimension are made to assess the real and predicted means and variances. Neuron editing is used to evaluate if meaningful transformations are produced globally. Comparisons of every dimension show that neuron editing better predicts the principle direction and magnitude of transformation across all dimensions, preserving variation in the real data. The GAN generates data with less variance than really exists in almost all dimensions. Neuron editing is a novel approach for generating transformed versions of data based on observed pre-and post-transformation versions of a small subset. It addresses the problem of applying treatment effects to the remainder of the dataset in clinical trials or experimental settings.

It uses autoencoder latent layers to mimic changes in activation distribution and successfully predicts transformations in image data. Neuron editing applies treatment effects to internal layer encodings to mimic transformations in image data and predict synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning edits in a hidden layer allows for interactions with context information during decoding. Learning edits in a hidden layer enables interactions with context information during decoding, facilitating the extraction of joint probability distributions in a dimensionality reduced space. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or generating conditionally."
