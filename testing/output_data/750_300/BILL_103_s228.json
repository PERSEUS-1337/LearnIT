    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans ride bicycles regularly, leading to numerous head injuries and deaths. A significant portion of these incidents involve children under 15, resulting in substantial costs to society. Children under 15 account for a significant portion of bicycle accidents, costing society $7.6 billion annually. Head injuries in children can cost $4.5 million over their lifetime. Universal helmet use could have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries, yet only 5% of children wear helmets while riding bicycles in the US. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce laws on bicycle helmet use, assist in acquiring helmets, educate on helmet importance for safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\" until a final standard is established. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets within 60 days of the enactment of the Act, based on interim standards such as ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\". The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets within 60 days of the Act, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and address child injury risks. The proceeding under this section is exempt from sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act. The final standard for bicycle helmets, established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days of the Act, will address child injury risks and prevent helmets from coming off. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to this proceeding. Any bicycle helmet not meeting the interim standard will be considered in violation of consumer product safety regulations. The final standard for bicycle helmets, established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, will address child injury risks and prevent helmets from coming off. Any helmet not meeting the interim standard will be considered in violation of consumer product safety regulations. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final safety standards."
