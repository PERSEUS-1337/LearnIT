    "content": "The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 redesignated sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and added a new section 302 for findings and purposes. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Nation celebrates the 200th anniversary of the Survey of the Coast, authorized by Congress and created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 for conducting surveys and providing nautical charts for safe passage through the Nation's ports and coastline. These capabilities are now part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, encompassing research, development, operations, products, and services. The mission requirements and capabilities related to hydrographic, geodetic, and shoreline surveying, cartography, mapping, tides, currents, water level observations, and maintenance of a national spatial reference system are currently housed in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is essential for ensuring safe navigation. The need to maintain federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is crucial for safe marine transportation and economic prosperity. With the increasing congestion in the marine transportation system and the expected doubling of international maritime commerce in the next 20 years, it is essential to support safe navigation and promote international trade. The Nation's marine transportation system is becoming more congested, with the volume of international maritime commerce expected to double in the next 20 years. Nearly half of the cargo in U.S. waters is oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances, supporting national needs for emergency response, homeland security, and marine resources. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services for the Great Lakes, coastal waters, and the territorial sea, including emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and ocean science advancement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in cooperation with other agencies and states, establishes national standards for hydrographic data and services. The Director of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. in the international hydrographic community. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey, led by the U.S. National Hydrographer, provides hydrographic expertise and data that are essential for establishing marine and coastal territorial limits, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey, led by the U.S. National Hydrographer, provides hydrographic expertise and data essential for establishing marine and coastal territorial limits, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. The Act aims to enhance NOAA's capabilities and promote research, development, and application of new technologies for increased efficiency, competitiveness, social and economic benefits, safety, and environmental protection. The Act aims to augment NOAA's capabilities for hydrographic data, support safe international trade, provide real-time information for navigation, and enhance homeland security and emergency response. The Act aims to support homeland security, emergency response, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services with various applications such as storm surge monitoring, erosion prediction, and pollution trajectory warnings. The Act supports various applications such as storm surge monitoring, erosion prediction, pollution trajectory warnings, marine and coastal geographic information systems, habitat restoration, sea-level trends, and environmental assessments. It also promotes improved ocean and coastal mapping, observations, research, and development in hydrographic data and related technologies. The Act aims to promote improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations, support research and development in hydrographic data and related technologies, and provide national and international leadership in hydrographic services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include the management, maintenance, interpretation, certification, and dissemination of various types of data for hydrographic services, including bathymetric, shoreline, geodetic, geospatial, geomagnetic, tide, water level, and current information. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include the production of nautical charts, databases, and products derived from hydrographic data. The term 'Coast and Geodetic Survey Act' is redefined. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Administration's duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act include providing hydrographic services to promote safe marine transportation and fulfill the Act's purposes. The Administrator may procure, lease, evaluate, test, develop, and operate vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and hydrographic data acquisition. They shall also design, install, maintain, and operate real-time hydrographic monitoring systems. The Administrator is responsible for ensuring safe navigation and operational expertise in hydrographic data acquisition and services. They are also tasked with designing, installing, maintaining, and operating real-time hydrographic monitoring systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency. Additionally, they may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support the conservation and management of coastal and ocean resources when appropriate. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support conservation, management of coastal and ocean resources, save lives, protect property, and resume commerce in emergencies, disasters, homeland security, and maritime awareness needs. They have the authority to create and operate real-time hydrographic monitoring systems for navigation safety and efficiency. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in emergencies, disasters, homeland security, and maritime awareness needs. The Administrator has the authority to award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in emergencies, disasters, homeland security, and maritime awareness needs, as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Changes were made to the Quality Assurance Program and the Hydrographic Services Review Panel under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Specifically, amendments were made to sections regarding the designation of subsections. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change subsection numbers and the composition of the panel. Voting members will now consist of 15 individuals appointed by the Administrator, with nonvoting members including the Co-directors of the Joint Hydrographic Institute and up to two NOAA employees appointed by the Administrator. The panel will now consist of 15 voting members appointed by the Administrator, with nonvoting members including the Co-directors of the Joint Hydrographic Institute and up to two NOAA employees. Voting members must be qualified in disciplines related to hydrographic data and services. The panel, appointed by the Administrator, will consist of 15 voting members qualified in disciplines related to hydrographic data and services. Voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. Section 307 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for carrying out the Act."
