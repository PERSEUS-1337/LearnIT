    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Federal law also directs child welfare agencies to develop policies for older youth transitioning from care. Despite independent living programs and federal policies aimed at assisting older youth transitioning from foster care, research shows that these individuals still struggle more than their peers in the general population when it comes to transitioning to adulthood. Former foster youth face challenges during their early adult years. Former foster youth face challenges during their early adult years, including difficulties in transitioning to adulthood such as forgoing higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public supports. Efforts by policy makers and child welfare advocates have brought attention to these challenges, with Congress focusing on ensuring youth have connections to caring adults and continued state support. Efforts by policy makers and child welfare advocates, along with Congress, have brought attention to challenges facing youth transitioning from care. Congress is focused on ensuring youth have connections to caring adults and continued state support after reaching the legal age of majority. Federal policy makers are interested in providing a safety net for youth who are wards of the state, as most youth are not ready to live independently at age 18. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, including those focused on older youth in care. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. This law is significant for older youth in foster care. The 113th Congress also held hearings on child welfare topics focusing on older youth. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was passed by Congress to address child welfare issues, specifically focusing on protections for older youth in foster care and promoting normalcy for children in care. President Obama signed the bill into law on September 30, 2014. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was signed into law on September 30, 2014, to protect older youth in foster care and promote normalcy. The law requires child welfare agencies to address sex trafficking issues. Implementation challenges include extending foster care to older youth. The implementation challenges of extending foster care to older youth under P.L. 110-351 include states facing cost concerns despite federal assistance. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care. States may be hesitant to extend care due to cost, despite federal assistance. They are required to help youth develop a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care, identifying available supports. Policy makers and advocates worry about challenges faced by older foster youth and those aging out. Emancipated youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections with adults, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Limited information is available on their outcomes, but a new national database may provide insight into areas such as education, employment, and social service contact. Emancipated youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections with adults, securing health insurance, and staying connected to work and school. Limited information is available on their outcomes, but a new national database may provide insight into areas such as education, employment, and social service contact. Concerns also exist about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, with P.L. 113-183 requiring child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor state implementation of these requirements. The report discusses the implementation of P.L. 113-183, which requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve youth vulnerable to child sex trafficking. Congress may need to monitor state implementation of these requirements. The report provides background on federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth and discusses the implementation of select aspects of P.L. 110-351. It notes a decline in the overall number of children in foster care over the past decade, with approximately 523,000 children in foster care in FY2002 and 397,122 in FY2012. The share of older children in care also increased but then declined slightly over this period. The number of children in foster care has been decreasing over the past decade. In FY2002, there were approximately 523,000 children in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. The percentage of older children in care increased but then slightly declined. Children aged 13-17 made up 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The number of older youth aging out of foster care also increased over the years. In FY2002, over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. This number increased each year until FY2010, when slightly more than 26,000 youth aged out, accounting for 11% of all children who exited. However, in FY2012, the number of youth emancipating reached a recent low of 23,396 (10%). Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. A study called the Midwest Evaluation is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions about their outcomes in four data collection waves. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions in four data collection waves, comparing their outcomes to peers in the general population. Results at age 26 showed similarities between former foster youth and their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions in four data collection waves. Results at age 26 found that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. For example, they were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree. Former foster youth in the Midwest Evaluation study faced barriers to education such as affordability, employment, childcare, and transportation. While they were almost as likely to have held a job as their peers, fewer were currently employed and had a lower annual income. The state child welfare agency is responsible for their care and placement after removal from their homes. Former foster youth in the Midwest Evaluation study had lower annual income compared to their peers, with a mean income of $13,000 versus $32,000. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect, using federal and state funds to facilitate reunification or find a permanent home. Funding sources include Title IV-E foster care under the Social Security Act. The primary federal source of funding for child welfare services is Title IV-E foster care, which aims to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care. States must have a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services to ensure a permanent home is established. The federal funding for child welfare services under Title IV-E foster care aims to ensure the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care. States are required to have a written case plan outlining the child's placement and services for establishing a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed regularly, at least every 6 months by a judge or panel, and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. The court must also consult with the child in an age-appropriate manner during any permanency hearing. The court must review the case plan for older youth in care every 6 months by a judge or panel, and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. For youth age 14 and older, the written case plan must include programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood. The case plan for children in foster care age 14 and older must include programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood, as well as a document listing their rights regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, provision of identification documents, safety, and avoidance of exploitation. The child must acknowledge receipt and understanding of these rights. The case plan for children in foster care age 14 and older must include programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood, as well as a document listing their rights regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, provision of identification documents, safety, and avoidance of exploitation. Children in foster care have the right to be safe, avoid exploitation, and must be consulted in the development of their case plan and permanency plan. They can choose up to two members of the planning teams, with one being their advisor and advocate. The case planning and permanency planning teams for children in foster care age 14 and older must include individuals chosen by the child, with one serving as their advisor and advocate. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan for housing and other needs upon emancipation from foster care. States must work to find adoptive parents or legal guardians for children who cannot reunite with their parents. Despite efforts, some older youth age out of foster care without finding a permanent home. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program aims to provide support in such cases. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for independence when they age out. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act was enacted to address concerns and make significant changes to the child welfare system. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, focusing on older youth in foster care and their transition to adulthood. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The 113th Congress has focused on the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking, passing the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act in 2014. This law provides protections for older youth in care and promotes normalcy for children in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), signed into law in 2014, provides protections for older youth in care and promotes normalcy for children in foster care. It requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children and offers federal funds for reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states and Indian tribes can receive federal funds for room and board costs for children in foster care. The funding is an open-ended entitlement basis, meaning the federal government must reimburse states for eligible expenses. Eligibility for Title IV-E foster care is based on the child or youth being in care. Title IV-E foster care funding is an open-ended entitlement from the general treasury, obligating the federal government to reimburse states for eligible expenses for children in care. Eligibility criteria include citizenship, age, income/assets tests, and a judge's determination of the child's welfare in the home they were removed from. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" on behalf of every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, placed in an eligible licensed setting with an eligible provider. A Title IV-E maintenance payment is provided by the state or tribal child welfare agency for eligible children in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, liability insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment travel. Federal reimbursement for costs such as food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, liability insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment travel is available for children in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must also promote safety and permanency for children in care. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for federal maintenance payments. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States and tribes can provide foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they meet certain criteria, such as completing high school, pursuing post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or working at least 80 hours per month. States and tribes can provide foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they meet certain criteria, such as completing high school, pursuing post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or working at least 80 hours per month. Additionally, states and tribes may seek reimbursement for foster care if the youth has a medical condition that prevents them from participating in activities, as supported by regularly updated information in the youth's case plan. The law does not specify programs that can help remove barriers to employment or define medical conditions that could prevent youth from working or attending school. States are allowed to seek federal foster care reimbursement. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. Child care institutions are defined as facilities with no more than 25 children, excluding detention facilities or training schools. The law does not specify programs to remove barriers to employment or define medical conditions that could prevent youth from working or attending school. A care institution is a facility for up to 25 children licensed by the state, excluding detention facilities or training schools. States can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older in foster care living independently. HHS will establish regulations for qualifying settings. The act allows youth in foster care to be placed in a supervised independent setting. HHS issued instructions in 2010, encouraging states to extend foster care assistance until age 21. States must provide a rationale if they choose to extend assistance to a lower age. States or tribes extending foster care assistance to youth aged 19 or 20 must provide a rationale in their Title IV-E plan. This plan outlines how they administer programs under Title IV-E, with funding contingent on approval. Criteria must be established to determine if youth meet employment or education conditions, or have a medical condition preventing pursuit of these options. Verification of continued eligibility is also required. Young people in extended foster care must meet employment or education conditions and have a medical condition preventing pursuit of these options. States and tribes need to verify that youth continue to meet these conditions. Examples of activities include finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. Extended foster care youth must meet employment or education conditions, including preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in post-secondary education, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. States and tribes can establish specific requirements for extended care, such as providing assistance only to those enrolled in post-secondary education. The guidance advises states and tribes to consider providing extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older in foster care, ensuring ample support for older youth. Program instructions address eligibility criteria for Title IV-E foster care, including young people reaching the state age of majority and those entering care at age 18 or older. The instructions for Title IV-E foster care eligibility apply to young people reaching the state age of majority and those entering care at age 18 or older. Eligibility is based on meeting income, assets, and living arrangements criteria at the time of removal from their home. States are not required to redetermine AFDC eligibility for these youth. For youth age 18 or older entering or reentering care, eligibility is based on their own circumstances at the time of removal from their home. Youth in extended care must have entered care through a court order or voluntary placement agreement. If youth came into care before age 18 and remain in care after age 18, the court order or voluntary agreement must have been in place before age 18. Youth in extended care must have entered care through a court order or voluntary placement agreement. The program instructions address removal criteria for youth who are 18 or older, allowing for court determination or voluntary placement agreement as guardian. The program instructions address removal criteria for youth who are 18 or older, allowing for court determination or voluntary placement agreement as guardian. This provision is subject to the requirement that there be a judicial determination that remaining in care is in the child's best interest if Title IV-E payments extend beyond the first 180 days of the voluntary placement agreement. Placement and care rules for older youth are also addressed. The program instructions address placement and care rules for older youth, allowing for supervised independent living or placement in foster family homes or child care institutions. HHS does not currently permit extended Title IV-E payments beyond the first 180 days of voluntary placement agreements for youth in care. The program instructions allow for youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations for independent living settings, leaving it up to states and tribes to develop appropriate arrangements. The instructions allow for youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings, with examples such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in supervised independent living settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes are advised to apply in a developmentally appropriate manner. States and tribes are advised to apply the same case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care as they do for children under 18. Case plans for youth aged 18 and older should address their needs and include benchmarks for independence. The case plan and review requirements for youth aged 18 and older should focus on addressing their needs and include benchmarks for achieving independence. Periodic reviews every six months should involve the youth and assess their safety in placement. States and tribes should make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth, reflecting goals of emancipation or independence. States and tribes are required to make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in foster care, reflecting goals of emancipation or independence. The court can determine the plan without a hearing if authorized by a judiciary member. The program guidance allows for determinations on permanency plans without a court hearing, as long as authorized by a judiciary member. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, except for children under 18 or 19 completing school. Data collection and reporting requirements for youth in foster care who are IV-E eligible are extended to those who remain in care after age 18 and receive federal foster care maintenance payments. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend the maximum age of foster care, with 18 states' plans approved by HHS as of May 2014. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions had amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend foster care until age 21. HHS approved plans for 18 states and the District of Columbia, with two other states under review. Indiana and Nebraska extend care until ages 20 and 19, respectively. Virginia, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are reviewing plan amendments to extend foster care until age 21. Indiana extends care to age 20, Nebraska to age 19, but legislation in Nebraska in 2013 may extend care to 21. Most states allow youth to remain in care under certain conditions, with exceptions for medical reasons in some cases. Tennessee requires youth to be in school to remain in care. Some states allow youth to remain in foster care under specific conditions, with exemptions for medical reasons. Tennessee requires youth to be in school or in a program addressing employment barriers to stay in care. Washington and West Virginia limit care to eligible youth completing high school or an equivalent program. Other states considering extending care should evaluate youth outcomes and various factors. Some states allow eligible youth to remain in foster care while completing high school or an equivalent program. When considering extending care, states need to evaluate factors such as youth outcomes, costs, court oversight, rethinking extended care, older youth returning to care, placement in foster care settings after age 18, and qualifying placements for independent living settings. The research literature on youth who emancipate from care or stay in care beyond age 18 is limited. A study in the Midwest Evaluation found that youth who remained in care until age 20 had better outcomes than those who emancipated at 18. The study looked at former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The study in the Midwest Evaluation found that youth who remained in care until age 20 had better outcomes than those who emancipated at 18 in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Remaining in care was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. The Midwest Evaluation found that foster youth in Illinois who remained in care until age 21 had higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was associated with a $470 increase in average annual earnings, with a total increase of $924 for those who stayed longer. The Midwest Evaluation found that foster youth in Illinois who remained in care until age 21 had higher earnings and a reduced risk of pregnancy. Youth who stayed longer in care saw an increase of $924 in average annual earnings. Additionally, they were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. Youth in Illinois who remained in care until age 21 had higher earnings and a reduced risk of pregnancy. While the benefits of staying in care seemed to diminish two years after aging out, by age 23, these individuals were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree. The study found that youth in Illinois who aged out of care had higher earnings and reduced pregnancy risk. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a degree. Researchers suggest they lost support services, leading to a focus on basic needs like housing. Youth aging out of foster care may struggle to meet basic needs like housing, lacking academic and social/emotional support. States face challenges extending care due to budget constraints. In a review of state policies on extending federal foster care in 2014, budget constraints were cited as a major factor by 17 states that did not extend care. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders and reviewing federal requirements when considering extending care. States can convene a planning group of stakeholders to review federal requirements and options for extending foster care to youth beyond age 18. They should consider existing supports, reach agreement on key design issues, project costs, and consider next steps. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are highlighted. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies on extending care to age 21. Considerations include key design issues, project costs, and potential benefits in offsetting societal costs like prison admissions and welfare payments. Extending foster care or providing transitional living services can offset costs to society, such as prison admissions and welfare payments. A study evaluated the cost and benefits of extending foster care based on Illinois data, showing potential savings by keeping youth in care until age 20. The costs of extending care beyond age 18 in Illinois were estimated to be around $20,800 annually, or $19,000 if public assistance costs were subtracted. The benefits were evaluated based on the potential for youth to earn higher wages by attending college while in care. The analysis found an average return of about $2 for every $1 spent on a youth remaining in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over the youth's lifetime. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. The analysis found that keeping youth in care resulted in an average return of $2 for every $1 spent, earning approximately $72,000 over their lifetime. The potential costs and benefits of extending care were not fully examined, including additional time and personnel needed by child welfare agencies and courts, as well as societal benefits like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant consideration for most states. The cost of providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant consideration for most states, with only partial reimbursement from the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. Eligibility determination and data collection costs are counted as administrative costs. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth, based on specific criteria for eligibility and placement. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to a state's Federal funding. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is linked to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. Program administration costs are reimbursed at 50%, while training costs are reimbursed at 75%. The federal government does not explicitly require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children. The federal government does not explicitly require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children who are ineligible for federal foster care. States may choose to cover only youth who are IV-E eligible, with full costs for non-eligible children covered by state or local treasuries or other federal funding sources. States have the option to cover only youth who meet Title IV-E eligibility criteria, with full costs for non-eligible children covered by state or local treasuries or other federal funding sources. Extending care only to certain eligible youth may raise equity concerns, as it could result in different levels of reimbursement and services for eligible and non-eligible youth. Eligible youth may remain in care after age 18 if they meet certain requirements. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting specific criteria, such as attending school or working. States can make staying in care conditional on pursuing certain pathways. Some states restrict eligibility for extended foster care to receive federal reimbursement. States and tribes can make staying in foster care conditional on pursuing specific pathways, potentially raising equity concerns if certain activities are restricted. For example, limiting extended care to only those in post-secondary education may reinforce inequality among youth who choose different paths like entering the workforce before pursuing college. Federal child welfare law gives state courts the responsibility to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, ensuring each child has a suitable permanency goal, regardless of their educational choices. This could impact youth in foster care who may opt out of college for work or pursue higher education later, potentially creating disparities in access to extended care. Federal child welfare law mandates state courts to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, ensuring a suitable permanency goal. A case review must be conducted every six months to assess progress and address placement concerns. A case review must be conducted every six months to assess progress and address placement concerns, with a permanency plan established for each child in care within 12 months of removal. This plan must be determined at a permanency hearing held in a court of competent jurisdiction or by a court-appointed/administrative body. The permanency plan for each child in care must be determined at a permanency hearing or by a court-appointed/administrative body. The plan must be reviewed at least every 12 months, with consultation with the child in an age-appropriate manner. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, and to those 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. HHS program instructions specify that case review system protections apply to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, and to those 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under voluntary placement. Per HHS program instructions, states can exclude children over 18 not receiving Title IV-E payments from case review and protections. Permanency hearings are not mandatory for youth under voluntary placement, but a case review must occur every six months. States extending care beyond age 18 may provide different levels of services based on IV-E eligibility, potentially leading to varying levels of support and enforcement of requirements for non-IV-E eligible youth. Non-IV-E eligible youth in extended care may not receive the same level of services and oversight as IV-E eligible youth, leading to potential gaps in meeting their needs. Juvenile courts' jurisdiction over cases involving these youth is also a separate issue. The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends that states enact legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement can continue beyond age 18 for older youth in care. The ABA recommends legislation for juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care, ensuring accountability and involvement in hearings. Foster care for youth 18 and older should provide additional support. The ABA recommends legislation for juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care, ensuring accountability and involvement in hearings. Stakeholders urge states to reconceptualize models for older youth in foster care, providing different supports than those received at a younger age. The Jim Casey Foundation highlights the challenges faced by foster youth aging out of the system at 18, emphasizing the lack of gradual transition and support. Young people in foster care lack decision-making opportunities and age out abruptly without proper support. Extending traditional foster care is not sufficient for their needs. Extended care should be developmentally appropriate, tailored to young adults, address trauma and loss, and enable their growth. Extended care for young adults in foster care should be developmentally appropriate, addressing trauma and loss, and involving them in decision-making. Research on adolescent brain development highlights the need for strong social supports during the transition to adulthood. Research suggests that young adults have a \"second window\" of neurological growth and development, emphasizing the need for strong social supports during the transition to adulthood. It also highlights the importance of opportunities for young people to learn from mistakes, take on increasing responsibility, and develop healthy relationships with family, friends, and others. Extended care should assist young people in maintaining permanent connections and developing the skills they need for independence. Extended care for young people focuses on helping them identify and maintain permanent connections while developing skills for healthy relationships with family, friends, and others. This approach emphasizes youth taking the lead in choosing who they want to connect with. It may involve graduated levels of supervision and support, redesigning case planning, assigning roles and responsibilities at an earlier age, and providing experiences that promote autonomy. The case planning team works closely with the young person to achieve these goals. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers identified reasons why youth in some parts of Illinois do not remain in extended care despite state policies. Child welfare services in the state are administered to support young people in building social networks and increasing autonomy. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers found that in the Cook County region, over 81% of youth remain in care beyond age 18, compared to the 54% in the other regions. The Department of Child and Family Services' four regional offices administer child welfare services in Illinois. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers found that factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 include active involvement of some juvenile courts in retaining youth despite resistance from stakeholders. The study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children identified factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21, including juvenile courts retaining youth despite resistance from stakeholders and lack of understanding of laws and policies. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 include limited foster care placements for older youth, stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards staying in care. Youth often request to leave due to restrictions imposed by their caseworker. These factors may be relevant to other states as well. In states that extend foster care, youth age 18 or older who emancipate from care may later decide to return due to challenges of living independently. States and tribes are permitted to extend foster care assistance according to July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS. States and tribes can extend foster care assistance for youth who may choose to return to care after turning 18, as per July 2010 HHS program instructions. The Government Accountability Office examined the implementation of this in 19 states. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office found that 19 states allow young people to leave and re-enter foster care. Youth can stay in care under voluntary placement agreements in 12 of these states. States that opt for extended care options provide supervised independent living for youth over 18 in foster care. In states that offer extended care options, youth in foster care can live independently in supervised settings after turning 18. The child welfare agency continues to provide supervision in these independent living arrangements. In states with extended care options, youth in foster care can live independently in supervised settings after turning 18. The child welfare agency provides supervision, but there is a lack of guidance on oversight for youth in these settings. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning essential life skills. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues such as purchasing independent living units, screening individuals living with youth in care, determining the share of rent and utilities youth should cover, and providing support for young adults to learn essential life skills. The child welfare agency must consider various factors when placing youth in independent living settings, including screening individuals living with youth, determining rent and utilities responsibilities, visitation frequency, consequences for lease violations, and potential for moving to different settings based on progress. In independent living settings, youth may face consequences for lease violations or damages, and can transition to different settings based on progress. States provide supervised independent living settings for youth in extended care, with supports for transitioning back home. In extended care, states offer supervised independent living settings to help youth transition back home. Challenges include finding appropriate housing options. Minnesota allows youth to live in apartments, homes, dorms, and other settings. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Minnesota allows youth in extended care to live in various settings such as apartments, homes, and dorms. The state is determining how to support youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state, with caseworkers required to meet them monthly. Youth can live with roommates but not with parents or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. The state of Minnesota allows youth in extended care to live in various settings like apartments, homes, and dorms. Independent living settings do not require licensing, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Additionally, the law addresses connecting youth to caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives, but federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have left foster care for permanent family via adoption or kinship guardianship. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Older youth with medical conditions preventing participation may also be covered. States and tribes can provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions preventing employment or participation in activities up to their 21st birthday, regardless of when they left foster care. This assistance can be continued if the youth has a mental or physical handicap that warrants it. States and tribes can provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions preventing employment or participation in activities up to their 21st birthday, regardless of when they left foster care. This assistance can be continued if the youth has a mental or physical handicap that warrants it. For kinship guardianship, the child must have resided for at least six consecutive months with the prospective relative guardian. HHS's July 2010 program instructions direct states to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older, up to the age the state has elected. States and tribes can establish conditions for kinship guardianship, including residency requirements with the prospective relative guardian. HHS's program instructions allow for adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies for youth over 18, with a broad definition of \"relative\" that includes biological, legal, tribal, extended family, and fictive kin. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides funds for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, with conditions for guardianship including a six-month care period and targeting specific age groups. The program aims to identify youth likely to remain in foster care until age 18. The Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, aiming to help them transition to self-sufficiency through employment, education, and emotional support. The Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) aims to provide support services for youth aging out of foster care, including personal and emotional support, connections to employment, education, housing, and other services to achieve self-sufficiency. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to offer independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16 for adoption or kinship placement. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure children likely to stay in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million. The Chafee program, established by the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, aims to provide opportunities for children in foster care likely to remain until 18 years old. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million, with states and tribes entitled to funding based on their foster care population. States must provide a 20% match and have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources. The Chafee program, established by the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, provides opportunities for children in foster care. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million, with states and tribes entitled to funding based on their foster care population. States must provide a 20% match and have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources. These programs offer direct services to youth such as housing, career exploration, education services, preventative health activities, counseling, mentoring, training in financial management, and other services. States and tribes must describe in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan how they will carry out their independent living program to be eligible for CFCIP funds. The CFCIP funds independent living programs for children in foster care, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. States and tribes must meet requirements on how funds are spent, such as limiting room and board expenses for youth ages 18 to 21. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides funds for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million for the program, allocated to states based on their share. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides funds for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million for the program, allocated to states based on their share. The program authorizes vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually per eligible youth for the cost of attending an institution of higher education. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides funds for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted at age 16 or older. Eligible youth can receive up to $5,000 annually for higher education costs. The vouchers cover tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, and related expenses. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. Youth receiving a voucher at age 21 can continue in the program until age 23. States can also provide independent living services to eligible youth who have left foster care permanently. States may have additional requirements for youth receiving a voucher at age 21 to continue in the program until age 23. Independent living services can be provided to youth who left foster care permanently before age 18, in addition to those aging out without a permanent home. These services focus on connecting youth to school, work, and resources until they reach age 21. States may have additional requirements for youth receiving a voucher at age 21 to continue in the program until age 23. Independent living services focus on connecting youth to school, work, and resources until they reach age 21, with states having discretion in defining eligibility criteria. In FY2016, states will need to prioritize which youth to serve in the program and ensure capacity to serve additional youth. In FY2016, states will need to prioritize serving youth in the program and ensure capacity to serve additional youth. Child welfare law requires a transition plan for youth, including options for housing, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. The transition plan for youth in foster care must be developed with the assistance of a representative and include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It should be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday, or later for those in states extending foster care, regardless of receiving benefits under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. The transition plan for youth in foster care must include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It should be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday, or later for those in states extending foster care. The plan must also address designating another individual to make health care treatment decisions if the youth becomes unable to participate in these decisions. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must also address designating someone to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to do so. This plan is separate from the case plan required for every child in foster care, but they complement each other. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It is distinct from the case plan required for every child in foster care but complements it. The case plan describes the youth's placement and care plan, while the transition plan outlines services and supports for the youth's successful transition to adulthood. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services to help them transition successfully to adulthood. The plan must specify housing options and be directed by the youth. The transition plan for youth in foster care must specify housing options and be directed by the youth, with guidance provided by HHS program instructions. The transition plan for youth in foster care, guided by HHS program instructions, should review permanency goals and engage youth well in advance. It is not required for youth leaving foster care more than 90 days before. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to engage youth in the transition plan process well in advance of permanency hearings. The transition plan is not required for youth leaving foster care more than 90 days before their 18th birthday, raising concerns for those who emancipate at age 17. Without a transition plan, youth emancipated from care at age 17 may be less prepared than their peers who are emancipated at ages 18 or older. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth who remain in care beyond age 18 but leave before reaching age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance on implementing transition plans. Social work professionals are developing guidance on how to carry out a transition plan for youth who remain in care beyond age 18 but leave before reaching age 19, 20, or 21. The guidance emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in the process, focusing on achieving permanency with caring adults, and developing plans based on the strengths of the young people. The planning process for youth transitioning from foster care should prioritize achieving permanency with caring adults. Plans should be youth-directed, focus on their strengths, and involve service providers and stakeholders in the process. States have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning and provide essential supports. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require youth input on the plan and ensuring key documents are included. Some jurisdictions have separate transition plans and require specialists to assist youth with the process. Several jurisdictions require a separate transition plan for youth aging out of foster care, with over half requiring a specialist to assist with the process. Challenges reported include lack of staff training, difficulty engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for transitioning youth. Some states, like Hawaii and Nebraska, have developed unique transition planning processes. In some states like Hawaii and Nebraska, unique transition planning processes have been developed for youth aging out of foster care. Hawaii, for example, holds transition planning \"circles\" where youth and others celebrate the young person becoming an adult and assist in planning for their future. These conferences are youth-driven and aim to draw on the youth's support system to generate options and resources for decision-making. Transition planning processes in states like Hawaii and Nebraska involve youth-driven conferences to assist young people in foster care with planning for their future. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit specifying roles and oversight, including a checklist revisited after six months. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, specifying roles, oversight, and a transition proposal checklist. It includes a \"permanency pact\" for youth to identify individuals who can assist them during their transition with various supports. Transitioning older foster youth face challenges as they age out, including difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Policy makers and child welfare advocates are concerned about the lack of support for these youth as they transition to adulthood. The Midwest Evaluation and other research show that transitioning older foster youth struggle with forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. There is limited knowledge about their outcomes as they leave foster care, but a new national database may provide insights into areas like education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children who may go missing from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), enacted in September 2014, aims to address issues faced by youth aging out of foster care, such as lack of permanent relationships with caring adults and vulnerability to sex trafficking. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth, a study tracking young people who aged out of foster care, shows that at age 26, these youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. The study on Former Foster Youth at age 26 shows they were more likely to be married and less likely to live with parents compared to peers. Many alumni did not have strong relationships with biological family members. The study on former foster youth at age 26 revealed that a significant portion did not have strong relationships with some relatives after leaving care. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting long-term connections with caring adults, which can lead to better outcomes for youth. Advocates push for policies to enhance the transition to adulthood by fostering lasting connections with supportive adults, aiding youth in achieving successful outcomes through emotional and financial backing. Child welfare agencies in some areas actively work to secure permanent adult relationships for youth aging out of care, emphasizing the importance of a stable, secure, and committed connection for these individuals. Relationships for youth in foster care are crucial for their well-being and success. These connections involve committed adults providing stability, security, and unconditional support. Practitioners emphasize the importance of helping youth find permanent connections through various means, including adoption and developing relationships with caring adults like teachers. Child welfare researchers caution practitioners in designing policies to help foster youth form lasting connections with adults. Youth in care have experienced failed relationships and could be harmed by unsustainable connections. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care, as research shows they tend to maintain contact with their biological family. This can be achieved through the case planning process and annual permanency hearings. Advocates recommend initiating permanency planning before youth leave care through the case planning process and annual permanency hearings. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child, including goals like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be selected with a compelling reason documented by states. APPLA is a permanency option for children in foster care when other goals like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative are not possible. It was added to the statute in 1997 to provide a stable and permanent arrangement for children, addressing concerns about long term foster care. States must document a compelling reason for selecting APPLA as the permanency goal. Advocates pushed for the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 to establish the Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) as a stable and permanent option for children in foster care when other permanency plans are not feasible. Concerns have been raised that APPLA has been misused as a substitute for true permanency options. Since the enactment of ASFA in 1997, concerns have been raised about APPLA being used as a default permanency goal for children in foster care. Advocates caution against pursuing certain settings like group care unless there is clear evidence that a child cannot function in a family before emancipation. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, co-chaired by Senators Grassley and Landrieu, issued a white paper in December 2010 discussing policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. The paper emphasized the importance of achieving permanency for all children in foster care and highlighted the lack of understanding among youth regarding permanency goals. The white paper from the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth proposed policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care, specifically addressing the goal of permanency. Two policy options related to APPLA were suggested: eliminating it as a case plan goal or restricting it to older teenagers after intensive family finding efforts. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) incorporates recommendations from a white paper by the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth. It stipulates that no child under 16 can have a permanency plan of APPLA, effective one year after enactment, or three years for children under an Indian tribe. The law requires court determination of APPLA necessity at each permanency hearing for older teenagers in care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates that children under 16 cannot have a permanency plan of APPLA, effective one year after enactment, or three years for children under an Indian tribe. Additional requirements are imposed for children with an APPLA designation during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews in foster care to ensure ongoing efforts to find a permanent family for them. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates that children under 16 cannot have a permanency plan of APPLA. Additional requirements during periodic reviews in foster care ensure ongoing efforts to find a permanent family for them. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth foster permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities and potential changes to federal child welfare law to assist youth in achieving permanency. Changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by amending written case plan requirements to include steps for ensuring a permanent living arrangement for emancipated children and older youth. The plan should also document efforts to find a permanent placement with a family or adult connection for the youth. A 2014 report by GAO found that states were surveyed about their transition planning process, revealing areas for improvement. The agency works to find permanent placements and living arrangements for youth. A 2014 report by GAO surveyed states on transition planning processes, with 36 jurisdictions requiring efforts to establish adult connections for young people. In Texas, youth receive help in identifying supportive adults for when they leave care. During the transition process in Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults who can provide consistent support when they leave care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact aims to help youth aging out connect with supportive adults for lifelong commitment. The Permanency Pact by Foster Club helps youth aging out of care connect with caring adults for lifelong support. Efforts to support permanency also include initiatives like Adoption Opportunity Grants for older youth. HHS funded a pilot project in 2005 to support adoption for older youth, known as Adoption Opportunity Grants. The grants aimed to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for youth through adoption, open adoption, guardianship, and kinship care. Federal grants could be funded to provide mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation introduced in Congress to permanently authorize funding for this purpose. The Department of Justice has already provided funding for mentoring programs for teens in care. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to authorize grants for mentoring foster children, supporting state and local child welfare agencies in promoting safety and well-being. Child victims of sex trafficking may be identified through child protective services. Children in foster care are often placed due to abuse. Child victims of sex trafficking may be identified through child protective services or reported to the agency's hotline. Children in foster care, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are vulnerable to trafficking, especially those who run away. State and local child welfare agencies may have limited capacity to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims due to inadequate training, resources, and high caseloads. The capacity of state and local child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking victims is limited due to inadequate training, resources, and high caseloads. States may lack mechanisms to identify cases involving children who are sex trafficked by perpetrators who are not their parents or caregivers. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration and information sharing to address child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration and information sharing across various sectors to address child sex trafficking. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on the opportunities and challenges for child welfare agencies to respond to child sex trafficking. Witnesses testified on how children become victims. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on child sex trafficking in the commercial sector. Witnesses testified on strategies used by child welfare agencies to combat child sex trafficking, leading to the passage of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183). This act amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and combat child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. The procedures must involve collaboration with various agencies and organizations. The Victims Protection Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures in consultation with various agencies to identify and provide services for at-risk children. These procedures must include relevant training for caseworkers and be implemented within two years of the bill's enactment. Additionally, agencies must report information about child trafficking to law enforcement authorities within 24 hours. The Victims Protection Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report child trafficking information to law enforcement within 24 hours. Within three years, agencies must report the total number of child trafficking victims to HHS annually, which will then report to Congress and the public within four years. The Victims Protection Act requires state child welfare agencies to report child trafficking information to law enforcement within 24 hours. HHS must annually report to Congress and the public the total number of children reported as victims of sex trafficking by state agencies. HHS is also directed to provide a written report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide services for child victims of sex trafficking. The Victims Protection Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report child trafficking information promptly. HHS is required to report annually to Congress on the number of children identified as sex trafficking victims by state agencies. Additionally, HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of the bill's enactment to advise on improving the response to domestic sex trafficking of minors in the child welfare system. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking is tasked with advising the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies to improve the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system. Congress should monitor states' implementation of these requirements one to four years after the law's enactment. Key considerations include the guidance provided by HHS to states and the role of child welfare agencies in responding to child sex trafficking. State child welfare agencies must serve only children and youth victims who are already in the child welfare system, not necessarily those who may come to the system. Key considerations for states include the type of guidance provided by HHS, serving youth not previously in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and identifying best practices for serving victims of child sex trafficking. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth victims who are already in the system, not those who may come to their attention as victims. Congress may consider the extent to which agencies should screen in victims. Pending legislation would mandate procedures for identifying and assessing reports of children involved in sex trafficking. Pending legislation, such as H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Child protective services workers would also be trained to identify and assess these victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Some child welfare stakeholders have sought a more uniform and robust response to children missing from care. The Child Welfare League of America conducted a survey in 2004 on children missing from foster care, revealing varying implementation of policies across states. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act provides guidance to state child welfare systems. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies on locating missing children from care and involving other entities. The extent of policy implementation and differences across jurisdictions remain unclear. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, investigating possible sex trafficking involvement, and reporting relevant information to HHS within one year of enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, investigating possible sex trafficking involvement, and reporting relevant information to HHS within one year of enactment. Children missing from care raise issues about the role of child welfare. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) shares information with law enforcement and the FBI's NCIC database. Child welfare agencies must address larger issues related to missing children from care. Best practices recommend agencies have procedures for workforce training and retention. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) issued best practice guidelines in 2005 for state child welfare agencies to have procedures in place for workforce training, involving youth and family in decision-making, examining foster care facilities, and taking corrective action if needed. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) issued best practice guidelines in 2005 for state child welfare agencies to involve family, tribal members, and caregivers in decision-making, examine foster care facilities with high runaway rates, and implement corrective actions if necessary. States also need to consider how they define missing children and whether all missing children should be reported to law enforcement agencies. States may need to consider whether all missing children, even those whose whereabouts are known, should be reported to law enforcement due to competing demands and limited resources in law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies may not always respond vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, like frequent runaways, due to competing demands and logistical challenges. This can put children and youth at risk, even if their whereabouts are known. The challenges in processing paperwork and transporting juveniles, dealing with runaway cases, and the risk of endangerment for known juveniles are key issues. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy outlines general requirements that could serve as a starting point for addressing these issues. The CWLA Best Practices and NCMEC guidelines emphasize collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies to address missing children. Little is known about children missing from foster care, and state agencies must report runaways to HHS via AFCARS. Currently, state child welfare agencies report missing children from foster care to HHS through AFCARS, but the system does not account for children missing for reasons other than running away. This gap hinders efforts to locate and assist these children. Child welfare agencies report missing children from foster care to HHS through AFCARS, but the system does not account for children missing for reasons other than running away. States may need to track and locate children who are no longer living where they were placed by child welfare agencies, including those who were abducted or are otherwise missing. Stakeholders have concerns that policies may limit foster youth from participating in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare agencies need to identify and count missing children, including those who were abducted. Concerns have been raised about policies limiting foster youth from participating in normal activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports. Witnesses testified about the restrictions faced by foster youth, such as limitations on activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports. Youth may need background screenings for certain activities, and their desire for independence can lead to risky behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Witnesses explained that teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. The enactment of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act addressed federal child welfare provisions related to youth independence and risk-taking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addressed federal child welfare provisions for youth in foster care, including promoting normalcy and implementing a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the law's implementation as it goes into effect one year after enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to make decisions for children in care. HHS will assist states in identifying best practices for implementing the standard, and child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and applying the standard. The law requires child welfare agencies to train foster parents on the reasonable and prudent parent standard for foster children's activities. States must update licensing standards for foster homes to include provisions for normalcy. Youth aging out of foster care face challenges with affordable housing. Several studies have examined rates of homelessness among former foster youth, with varying percentages reported. The Midwest Evaluation found that 24% of 23-year-olds reported being homeless at least once since exiting care. Former foster youth face housing instability, with 24% experiencing homelessness by age 23. Many also couch surf, lacking permanent housing. Individual factors like lack of financial support and ties to family impact their housing status. Former foster youth often face housing instability due to individual characteristics, involvement with the child welfare system, and the housing market. This can lead to difficulties in staying in school and maintaining employment. States can allocate up to 30% of their funds to address these housing challenges. Former foster youth may struggle with securing affordable housing, which can impact their ability to stay in school and maintain employment. While states can allocate funds for room and board, these may not be sufficient. Nonprofit organizations and housing programs may provide support for former foster youth in finding housing. In a review of housing programs for former foster youth, researchers found options like single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. These programs focus on providing independent living supports. Housing programs for former foster youth offer various options like single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. These programs focus on providing independent living supports, requiring youth to be working or in school. However, none of the programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. Some states face challenges in providing appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth, especially during school breaks. California law mandates public universities to review housing options for these youth. Some states require public universities to provide housing for emancipated foster youth during school breaks. The Higher Education Act addresses housing concerns for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth. The Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses housing concerns for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth by authorizing services specifically for them, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. Additionally, the law allows for the establishment of demonstration projects that provide comprehensive support services through the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. The Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes services for disadvantaged college students, including temporary housing during academic breaks. Funds can be used for demonstration projects providing support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. However, universities may not necessarily use funds for housing during breaks. Federal law allows universities to use funds for housing during breaks when on-campus housing is closed or unavailable. Owners of properties with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits can designate units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. Students are generally not considered low-income households for this purpose. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or employed, lacking support networks. Youth in foster care and other vulnerable groups are at higher risk. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or employed, lacking support networks. Youth in foster care and other vulnerable groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected from employment and education. Young people who have aged out of care tend to have low rates of employment and earnings. At age 24, about three out of five youth who emancipated in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina were working, with lower earnings compared to their counterparts nationally. These young people also faced challenges in education. The average monthly earnings for emancipated youth in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina were substantially lower than the national average of $1,535. Youth in care or who have aged out face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent education support. Foster care alumni are less likely to attend college, with only about 7% attending by age 26. Foster care alumni, especially those who age out of care, face challenges in education. By age 26, only about 7% of youth who aged out of care attained a degree, compared to one-third of the general youth population. This suggests that additional supports are needed to help foster care alumni complete their education, such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical support, including year-round housing. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in or formerly in care. Foster care alumni may require extra support to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance, as well as year-round housing. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in or formerly in care, with state agencies required to consider proximity to the child's school when placing them in foster care. The law requires state child welfare agencies to consider proximity to the child's school when placing them in foster care and include education-related records in the child's case plan. Agencies must collaborate with education authorities to ensure continuity in schooling or facilitate immediate enrollment if needed. The law mandates collaboration between state child welfare agencies and education authorities to ensure children in foster care remain in their current school or are promptly enrolled in a new school if it is in their best interest. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care maintenance payments. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, ensuring children in foster care are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and that educational records are provided to foster care parents at each placement. Educational records must be reviewed, updated, and supplied to a child's foster care parent at each placement. Federal agencies are working together to address the education needs of vulnerable youth, including foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought state teams from education, child welfare agencies, and the judicial branch to discuss promoting educational stability and improving outcomes for children in foster care. Teams were tasked with creating a plan for collaboration across systems. State teams from education, child welfare agencies, and the judicial branch collaborated to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite this, federal education law does not address the educational needs of these children. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve access to education for children and youth in foster care through federal education statutes. Recent legislation, like S. 1094, aims to improve education access for children and youth in foster care through federal education statutes. The bill would require state education agencies to ensure educational stability for foster children, allowing them to remain in the same school or enroll in a new one if necessary. The bill aims to ensure educational stability for children in foster care by requiring state education agencies to keep them in the same school or enroll them in a new one if needed. Federal education law also addresses the educational needs of current and former foster youth, providing supportive services through the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for foster youth, including mentoring and tutoring through the federal Trio programs. These programs aim to identify potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Higher Education Act mandates the Department of Education to require Trio program applicants to offer mentoring, tutoring, and other services to disadvantaged youth. The Trio programs aim to prepare these students for higher education and provide support services while in college. Additionally, the FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for foster care identification and provide information on federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funds independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is a key funding source for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of these services and the outcomes of former foster youth. Studies have not shown significant improvements in outcomes, and there is a lack of national data on how well former foster youth transition to adulthood. The Midwest Evaluation and other studies have not rigorously shown the effectiveness of interventions for improving outcomes for youth transitioning from foster care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will provide a national perspective on the transition to adulthood for former foster youth, but full implementation may take several years. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the primary funding source for independent living services for young people aging out of care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main funding source for independent living services for youth aging out of foster care. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend their maximum CFCIP funds. States receive $140 million annually for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend their maximum CFCIP funds, but additional funding is needed for independent living services. Research suggests that learning about effective services is crucial due to limited funding. States receive $140 million annually for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, with a 20% match requirement. Research indicates that additional funding is necessary for independent living services as current funding is limited. HHS conducted evaluations of innovative independent living programs funded by the CFCIP to determine their effectiveness. The Urban Institute and partners conducted an evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth funded by P.L. 106-169. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, non-marital pregnancies, delinquency, and crime rates. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts. The evaluation assessed the impact of independent living programs on foster youth, focusing on educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, non-marital pregnancies, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, including employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring programs. Participants were surveyed at three points over two years, with in-person interviews conducted by researchers. The evaluation in Los Angeles County, CA involved 1,400 youth in intervention and control groups surveyed at three points over two years. In-person interviews were conducted with various stakeholders, and state administrative data was used to assess demographics, placement history, and health status. The evaluation of the Los Angeles and Kern County programs, along with the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, found no statistically significant impacts overall. However, the Outreach program in Massachusetts showed positive impacts on some education outcomes for participating youth. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services emphasizing a youth development approach. The Outreach program aims to help youth achieve outcomes like obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. Social workers oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth, building close relationships to act as advocates for the youth. The Outreach program aims to help youth achieve outcomes like obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. Caseworkers oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth, developing close relationships to act as advocates for the youth. Caseworkers assist youth with tasks such as obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment, and may refer them to service providers as needed. The evaluation examined educational, employment, and other outcomes to assess the transition to adulthood, with Outreach youth more likely to report enrolling in college compared to the control group. The Outreach program aims to help youth achieve educational, employment, and other outcomes for a successful transition to adulthood. Outreach youth were more likely to enroll and persist in college, remain in foster care, and receive assistance in various areas such as money management and housing. Remaining in care and college enrollment were found to be closely linked in the study. The Outreach program aims to assist youth in achieving successful transitions to adulthood by providing educational and employment support. The study found that staying in foster care and enrolling in college were closely related, with Outreach youth reporting more help in educational and financial areas. However, outcomes in employment, housing, and other measures were similar between Outreach youth and the control group, raising questions about the program's overall effectiveness. The evaluation of the Outreach program raises questions about its efficacy in helping youth transition to independent living. While the program shows promise with case workers assigned to transitioning youth, outcomes in employment, housing, and other areas were not significantly better than for similarly situated foster youth. The Outreach program, which assigns case workers to transitioning youth, did not show significant improvements in outcomes compared to similarly situated foster youth, except in education and remaining in foster care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth, providing insight into their outcomes nationwide. However, states have reported limited information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169). The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks outcomes of current and former foster youth nationwide. States have reported limited information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169). The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to track outcomes of current and former foster youth. It aims to develop outcome measures to assess state performance in operating independent living programs and collect data on children receiving services and state performance. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to track outcomes of current and former foster youth, assess state performance in independent living programs, and collect data on children receiving services. The final rule for NYTD became effective on April 28, 2008, requiring states to start collecting data on youth in FY2011. States collect and report information twice a year on eligible youth receiving independent living services. States collect and report data on eligible youth receiving independent living services twice a year. The information includes their status in foster care, child welfare services, and outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. States collect data on the outcomes of current and former foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive independent living services. States have the option to track a sample of youth to reduce data collection burden, with financial penalties for non-compliance."
