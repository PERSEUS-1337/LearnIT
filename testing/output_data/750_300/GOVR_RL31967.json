    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and the government's own accounts, including trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Government surpluses or deficits determine changes in debt held by the public, while the on-budget fiscal balance does not directly affect debt held in government accounts. The government's on-budget fiscal balance does not directly affect debt held in government accounts, which are influenced by net financial flows into accounts like the Social Security Trust Fund. Legal requirements and government accounting practices also impact debt levels in government accounts. Federal borrowing from the public increased in most years since the late 1950s, except in FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. The federal government has increased borrowing from the public since the late 1950s, except for a few years. Budget deficits have led to more debt issuance. Growth in government-held debt, including trust funds, has been sustained since 1983. Since 1983, growth in federal debt, including trust funds, has led to the need for Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has further complicated debt limit issues, affecting the Treasury's ability to finance government activities when debt nears its legal limit. The U.S. Department of the Treasury faces challenges when federal debt approaches its legal limit, impacting its ability to finance government activities. Fluctuations in government income and outlays throughout the year affect the level of debt, even with trust fund accounts experiencing monthly deficits and surpluses. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing cash flow fluctuations. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is essential for managing cash flow fluctuations caused by fluctuations in government income and outlays. If the Treasury is unable to borrow due to a debt limit, it may struggle to meet all of its legal obligations in a timely manner. If the U.S. Treasury is unable to borrow due to a debt limit, it may struggle to meet all legal obligations in a timely manner, leading to cash flow issues and potential inability to pay bills or invest surpluses as required by law. The U.S. Treasury may face challenges meeting legal obligations and investing surpluses if unable to borrow due to the debt limit, potentially impacting borrowing costs and Treasury market. The Government Accountability Office warns that delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Defaulting on interest payments on Treasury securities could trigger a global financial crisis. Delaying payments on obligations effectively amounts to borrowing from various entities, leading to potential interest costs. The government's delay in payments can lead to borrowing from vendors, contractors, and others, incurring interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Credit agencies and banks are concerned about the impact on the financial system. Several credit ratings agencies and investment banks have expressed concerns about the consequences to the financial system and the economy if the U.S. Treasury were unable to fund federal obligations, as it could lead to significant effects on global capital markets. Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies in the past to manage cash and debt responsibilities during near-binding debt ceiling situations. If Treasury securities face default risks, global capital markets could be significantly affected. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies during near-binding debt ceiling situations, such as suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. The Treasury Secretary has the authority to invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to manage cash and debt responsibilities using specific government trust funds. The Treasury Secretary can use government trust funds like the Civil Service Retirement Fund and the Thrift Savings Fund during a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to manage cash and debt responsibilities. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008 at a pace of $10 billion per month. The U.S. Treasury Secretary can utilize government trust funds during a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to manage cash and debt responsibilities. The Treasury began selling off mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008 at a rate of $10 billion per month, aiming to minimize market disruptions. By March 2012, the Treasury's MBS portfolio had been eliminated. However, proceeds from potential asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. Proceeds from potential asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama and legal analysts reject this idea. More creative strategies are being considered. The Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits questioning the validity of the US public debt, has been suggested as a way for the President to bypass the debt limit. However, President Obama and legal analysts have rejected this idea. Creative strategies are being explored to manage federal finances when the debt limit hinders the Treasury's operations. The debt limit requires the Treasury to take extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations when near its statutory limit. While it has not caused default, it has caused inconvenience and uncertainty. Congress uses the debt limit to control spending and impose fiscal accountability on the federal government. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and impose fiscal accountability on the federal government. Some argue for its elimination, stating that other controls in the modern budget process have superseded its effectiveness. Some budget experts advocate eliminating the debt limit, arguing that the modern budget process has made it redundant. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, providing a different leverage for controlling federal spending. The debt limit provides Congress with leverage to control federal spending, separate from the budget process. Congressional committees have specific responsibilities for discretionary and mandatory spending decisions. Measures involving the debt limit often involve individual Members' input. Committees on the Budget draft budget framework for federal spending and taxation. Debt limit measures allow individual Members to influence fiscal policy. Congress historically restricts federal debt to assert constitutional powers. Aggregate limit on federal debt evolved between World War I and World War II. Limitations on federal debt have helped Congress assert its constitutional powers of the purse, of taxation, and of the initiation of war. Before World War I, Congress often authorized borrowing for specified purposes and specified details of debt instruments. Before World War I, Congress often authorized borrowing for specified purposes and specified details of debt instruments. This included limitations on the types of financial instruments Treasury could use, interest rates, maturities, and redemption details. Some opponents raised concerns about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, while proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt monetary settlements. These concerns became less relevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. The Act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to have $100 million outstanding in certificates of indebtedness with maturities under a year, mainly sold to large investors. The 1898 War Revenue Act allowed the Treasury Secretary to issue $100 million in certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing, mainly sold to large investors. Additionally, $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds were made available to the public for subscription. The act granted the Treasury Secretary administrative leeway within specified limits, which tended to expand over time. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed the Treasury Secretary substantial administrative leeway within specified limits, dropping certain restrictions on bond maturity and redemption. It incorporated unused borrowing capacity from previous acts but retained separate limits for previous debt issues. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed the Treasury Secretary more administrative flexibility, incorporating unused borrowing capacity from previous acts while retaining separate limits for previous debt issues. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to the act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. In the 1920s, Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with additional leeway to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues by allowing the issuance of notes and limiting the amount outstanding. Savings certificates were also designed for small investors. In the 1930s, Congress introduced aggregate constraints on federal borrowing, giving the Treasury more flexibility in financial management. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the need for orderly and economical management of public debt, especially with upcoming refinancing of Liberty bonds. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds to manage federal debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of orderly and economical debt management, leading to changes in bond issuance limits. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury more flexibility in issuing bonds to manage federal debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized orderly and economical debt management, leading to changes in bond issuance limits. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau called for a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds in 1935, highlighting their role in federal finances. Congress then established limits on shorter-term debt and outstanding bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau later requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt, leading to approval by the House and Senate in 1939. In March 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau asked Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt. The House approved the measure (H.R. 5748) on March 23, 1939, and the Senate passed an amended version on June 1. On July 14, the amendment was withdrawn in the Senate after the House had disagreed, thus clearing the way for President Franklin Roosevelt's signature. When enacted on July 20, the law (P.L. 76-201) created the first aggregate limit ($45 billion) covering nearly all public debt. The law (P.L. 76-201) enacted on July 20,  created a $45 billion aggregate limit on public debt, combining limits on bonds and shorter-term debt. This allowed the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by rolling over maturing notes into longer-term bonds, reducing interest costs and financial risks. Additionally, a separate $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities was introduced in 1940. The legislation in 1941 increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion, folding the separate $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities back under it. This gave the Treasury greater independence in managing federal debt, especially as the U.S. entered World War II. The debt limit was much closer to total federal debt compared to the end of World War I. During World War II, the debt limit was raised to accommodate increasing costs, reaching $300 billion by 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion. The Korean War was mostly financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. After World War II, the debt limit was reduced to $275 billion. The Korean War was mostly financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Eisenhower Administration requested an increase in 1953, but Congress did not raise the limit until 1954. Temporary increases followed, but the limit reverted to $275 billion in July 1957. Congress finally raised the limit in February the following year. In August 1954, Congress approved a temporary increase in the debt limit after declining to raise it following the State of the Union address. The limit reverted to $275 billion in July 1957, but was raised again in February the following year to \"compel more economy of efficiency.\" By March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, its level at the end of World War II. Since then, Congress has enacted 78 separate measures altering the federal debt limit, with most changes being relatively small compared to wartime or Great Depression adjustments. Since the end of World War II, Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the federal debt limit. Recent increases in the debt limit have been significant, such as a $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Debt held by the public has grown since FY2001 due to persistent budget deficits. Since FY2001, federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts grew by $855 billion and debt held by the public fell by almost $450 billion. Debt held in government accounts has also grown, mainly due to excess Social Security payroll taxes. Table 1 and Figure 1 show the components of federal debt as percentages of GDP since FY1996 and projections through FY2019. Table 2 provides information on debt limit increases. Federal debt has grown steadily since 1982, with debt held by government accounts increasing due to Social Security tax increases. Debt held by the public grew as a share of GDP through the mid-1990s. Deficits have contributed to the growth of debt held by the public. Table 2 provides information on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. Following the 1983 Greenspan Commission recommendations, federal debt increased as a share of GDP until the mid-1990s. Surpluses in the late 1990s reduced debt, but deficits in the early 2000s led to a rise in debt again. Accumulating debt in government accounts caused pressure on the debt limit in 2002. In the early 2000s, deficits led to a rise in debt as a percentage of GDP. Accumulating debt in government accounts caused pressure on the debt limit in 2002, with increases in debt held by the public adding to the strain. During the four fiscal years with surpluses, there was a net increase of $405 billion in total debt subject to limit. At the beginning of FY2002, debt subject to limit was within $217 billion of the existing $5,950 billion debt. In FY1998-FY2001, increases in federally held debt and decreases in debt held by the public resulted in a $405 billion net increase in total debt subject to limit. By the beginning of FY2002, debt subject to limit was $217 billion away from the $5,950 billion limit. Between then and May 2002, debt subject to limit increased by $217 billion, with $117 billion held by government accounts and $100 billion held by the public, nearing the limit. In FY1998-FY2001, total debt subject to limit increased by $405 billion, with debt held by government accounts and the public. By early FY2002, debt was $217 billion away from the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested a $750 billion increase to $6,700 billion due to the growing debt. Treasury kept debt below the limit by invoking its authority on April 4, 2002. The Administration repeatedly asked Congress to increase the debt limit as debt approached the limit in FY2002. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury suspended reinvestment in the G-Fund to issue new debt and meet obligations. By April 15, debt was just $25 million below the limit. The Treasury suspended reinvestment in the G-Fund to issue new debt and meet obligations. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit, but by mid-May 2002, it had risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. The Treasury, facing financing problems, requested Congress to raise the debt limit or make statutory changes to issue new debt to avoid default. Treasury warned that without action, the government would exceed the debt ceiling by May 16. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit or make statutory changes to issue new debt to avoid default by May 16. This allows the Treasury to suspend investments in trust funds and issue new debt to fund government operations. The Treasury reduced federal debt held by government accounts to issue new debt and avoid breaching the debt ceiling. Extraordinary actions were taken to fund government operations until June 28, 2002. Treasury postponed a securities auction but needed a debt limit increase to meet obligations at the end of June and beginning of July. The Treasury postponed a securities auction and indicated the need for a debt limit increase to avoid default as large payments and obligations were due at the end of June and beginning of July. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit through the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill. In 2002, Congress passed the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill to increase the debt limit. The House included language for a potential increase, but the Senate omitted it. Instead, the Senate passed a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The Senate passed a bill (S. 2578) to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In 2003, the House narrowly passed a $450 billion debt limit increase to avoid default. The President signed the bill into law, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. Treasury repeatedly requested the debt limit be raised to prevent financial problems. In 2003, the Treasury requested a debt limit increase to avoid financial problems. The Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the debt limit. The Treasury took actions to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the debt limit, allowing for additional debt issuance to acquire necessary cash. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" in April 2003. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" in April 2003, allowing legislation to raise the debt limit. The Senate acted in May 2003 after Treasury warnings of default, with debt just below the existing limit. In May 2003, the Senate raised the debt limit to $7,384 billion after receiving Treasury warnings of imminent default. The legislation was signed by the President on May 27. In January 2004, CBO estimated that the debt limit would be reached the following summer, prompting the Treasury to request another increase to avoid financial disruptions. In June 2004, the Treasury asked Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid disruptions to government finances. By October 14, the debt subject to limit reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the existing limit. Treasury used previous methods to keep debt under the legal limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that available measures were in place to avoid breaching the debt limit. The Treasury employed methods to keep debt under the legal limit, but available measures would be exhausted by mid-November without an increase. Failure to raise the debt limit could undermine the U.S. government's reputation in capital markets and raise borrowing costs. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in 2004, but final agreement with the Senate was not reached. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no resolution to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed by the House automatically under the Gephardt rule. Consequently, no measure was available to send to the Senate. As the debt approached the limit through the summer and into the fall, no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit. Earlier, in September 2004, the House had added an amendment to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations ( H.R. 5025 ) in an effort to. In September 2004, the House added an amendment to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations in an effort to remove Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the existing limit. Legislation was passed by the House but the Senate did not act on it. Senator Frist introduced legislation in November 2004 to raise the debt limit by $800. The government faced financial obligations as debt neared the limit. Legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion was introduced and approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law on November 19, 2004. The new limit was expected to be reached between August and December 2005. The President signed legislation (P.L. 108-415, 118 Stat. 2337) into law on November 19, 2004, raising the debt limit. The Treasury delayed a debt auction and implemented a \"debt limit suspension period\" before the increase. Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic. In 2005, Congress included three reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution, directing committees to report bills raising the debt limit. However, no bill was reported, leading to a delay in the debt limit increase. The Senate Finance Committee was instructed to report bills raising the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion by September 30, 2005. The Gephardt rule was triggered, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) automatically passing in the House to raise the debt limit. However, by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress, the Senate had not considered the resolution. The House passed H.J.Res. 47 to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. Treasury Secretary Snow warned that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase. Treasury Secretary Snow warned Congress in multiple letters that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase to avoid default. Despite taking measures to delay reaching the limit, the Treasury was close to being unable to meet its obligations by mid-March 2006. In March 2006, Secretary Snow authorized actions to address the government's inability to meet its obligations. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution in mid-May 2007. In 2006, the debt limit was raised to $8,965 billion. In mid-May 2007, Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution. The House's Gephardt rule triggered the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. Treasury requested another debt limit increase in July 2007, projecting it would be reached in October or November. In July 2007, the Treasury asked Congress to raise the debt limit, projecting it would be reached in October. The Senate approved the House resolution without changes on September 12, 2007, and the President signed it into law on September 29, 2007. Financial markets started showing signs of turmoil in mid-2007. The Senate passed House resolution H.J.Res. 43 on September 27, 2007, which was signed into law by the President on September 29, 2007 (P.L. 110-91). The financial crisis and recession that began in late 2007 led to federal actions to stabilize the housing and financial markets. The economic slowdown started with a decline in housing prices and a rise in interest rate spreads, leading to major financial institutions being hesitant to lend. This prompted actions to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending. The recession also caused federal deficits to increase, reaching 9.8% of GDP, with subsequent weak economic recovery. The recession led to large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending spiking to 9.8% of GDP. Economic recovery has been weak compared to other post-World War II recessions, affecting federal revenues from capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, and individual income taxes. The recession caused deficits to increase sharply, impacting federal revenues from capital gains, corporate taxes, and individual income taxes. Deficit spending can stimulate the economy if output levels are below potential, but it may also lead to inflation. Deficit spending can boost the economy through fiscal stimulus but may also accelerate inflation if output levels are near potential. In FY2008, the actual deficit exceeded estimates, and in FY2009 and FY2010, the deficits were projected to be significantly high. The budget deficit exceeded estimates in FY2008, reaching $455 billion. In FY2009 and FY2010, deficits were projected to be $1,587 billion and $1,381 billion, respectively. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times due to economic conditions and government actions. House and Senate resolutions recommended policies resulting in a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion, respectively. The House and Senate resolutions in 2009 recommended policies that would lead to a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion, respectively, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The budget conference report passed the Senate on June 4, 2008, and the House the next day. The House and Senate recommended spending levels in FY2009 that would require an increase in the debt limit. The House passed a measure to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, so the limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House passed a bill to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, which was later approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President on July 30, 2008. The bill also included provisions for extending a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The bill signed on July 30 (P.L. 110-289) increased the debt limit and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. It also established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to replace OFHEO and FHFB. The CBO estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers exceeding $100 billion. The CBO estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers exceeding $100 billion for potential intervention in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Concerns arose due to the debt limit being close to the ceiling when H.R. 3221 was passed. On September 7, 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship by the FHFA. The FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship on September 7, 2008, giving full control to stabilize financial markets. The U.S. Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related assets to stabilize markets, allowing holdings up to $700 billion. On September 20, 2008, the U.S. Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related assets to stabilize financial markets, with a $700 billion limit. Representative Barney Frank's amendment to raise the debt limit was rejected by the House on September 29, 2008. The House rejected a vehicle measure (H.R. 3997) incorporating the Treasury proposal to raise the debt limit to $11,315 billion. The Senate passed a different version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (H.R. 1424) with the same debt limit increase. It was signed into law on October 3, 2008. Congress considered another economic stimulus measure with tax cuts and spending increases to address current economic conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law by the President on the same day, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Congress considered another economic stimulus measure containing tax cuts and spending increases, which would increase the deficit. The Senate version of ARRA included a provision to raise the debt limit to $12,140 billion, while the House version did not. The final conference agreement on ARRA, signed into law in 2009, increased the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt limit of $13,233 billion, requiring an increase in the statutory debt limit. The conference report on the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2010 recommended policies that would lead to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule and resulting in a House Joint Resolution to raise the debt limit to $13,029 billion. In April 2009, the Gephardt rule was triggered, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) to raise the debt limit to $13,029 billion. Treasury announced in November that the debt limit could be postponed until December by reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing. The U.S. Treasury announced a postponement of reaching the federal debt limit until December by reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the limit. Repayments of TARP funds by major financial institutions could also contribute to this. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the limit. Repayments of TARP funds by major financial institutions could also contribute to this. Other measures, such as those taken in 2003 during a \"debt issuance suspension period,\" could extend the U.S. Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury was scheduled to issue $48 billion of nonmarketable securities to the FDIC on December 30 and make interest payments to various federal trust funds on December 31. The U.S. Treasury was scheduled to issue $48 billion of nonmarketable securities to the FDIC on December 30 and make interest payments to federal trust funds on December 31. Senior Members of the House chose a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow the Treasury to continue its debt management activities. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit to support normal debt management operations. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passing in the House on December 16 and in the Senate on December 24. The President signed the measure on December 28. On January 28, the Senate approved an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling.

Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues, but an amendment to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" was not approved. President Obama then charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation. The Fiscal Commission issued a report on December 1, 2010. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established by President Obama, issued a report on December 1, 2010. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, 2011, and the President signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2011, after voicing strong support for a debt limit increase. The 2011 debt limit episode was longer and more contentious compared to previous ones. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating caps on discretionary spending and other measures to constrain federal spending. Treasury Secretary Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period in May 2011 to extend borrowing capacity until August. On May 16, 2011, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period due to the federal debt reaching its limit. The Treasury confirmed that its borrowing authority would be exhausted by July 1, 2011, with extraordinary measures being used to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. The FY2011 federal deficit was projected to reach $1,399 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office. The FY2011 federal deficit is projected to reach $1,399 billion, and extraordinary measures may provide limited additional time before the government cannot meet its financial obligations. Some suggest cutting spending to slow the growth in federal debt, but the scale of required reductions would be significant. The U.S. Treasury announced on July 15 that it had suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a measure to avoid reaching the borrowing limit by August 2. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund to avoid reaching the borrowing limit by August 2. Analysts suggest that the Treasury may have limited cash management options, making funding federal operations more challenging without a debt limit increase. An independent analysis projects a significant cash flow deficit from August 3 to the end of the month. An independent analysis projects a cash flow deficit from August 3 to the end of the month, with cash inflows totaling $174.4 billion and projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures have shifted since January 6, 2011. Estimates of when Treasury would reach the debt limit and how long extraordinary measures would extend federal borrowing capacity have typically been close to Treasury's estimates, with higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities providing additional headroom. The Treasury Secretary's estimates on the debt limit and the duration of extraordinary measures to extend borrowing capacity are based on analysis of federal spending patterns, debt redemptions, and receipts. If Congress does not act, the Secretary may declare a debt issuance suspension period, allowing measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. The Treasury Secretary estimated the debt limit and duration of extraordinary measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. Certain measures, like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program, have already been taken. New issues of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit on January 6, 2011. The U.S. Treasury suspended new issues of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit on January 6, 2011, stating that federal debt would likely reach its limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. The Treasury projected that its borrowing capacity would be exhausted around July 8, 2011. The U.S. Treasury projected that federal debt would reach its limit between April 15 and May 31, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24 but was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 (H.R. 2560) was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. It aimed to increase the federal debt limit to $16,700 billion once a balanced budget amendment was proposed. This led to the introduction of the Budget Control Act of 2011 by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid on July 25. President Obama signed a revised compromise measure, the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25), into law on August 2, 2011. The Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, after being approved by the House and Senate. It included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. The Budget Control Act (BCA) signed into law in 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. Key provisions of the BCA included discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions through sequester, a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a vote on a balanced federal budget amendment, and a mechanism for raising the debt ceiling. The legislation in 2011 allowed for expedited consideration, mandated a balanced federal budget amendment, and provided a procedure for raising the debt ceiling. The debt limit was increased in two steps, first by $400 billion and then by $500 billion. The debt limit was increased to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011, and then by an additional $500 billion on September 22, 2011. A joint resolution of disapproval was required for the second increase, but it was rejected by the Senate. The House passed a disapproval measure, but the Senate did not act on it. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, prompting a potential $1.2 trillion increase. The President delayed the request to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The debt limit faced a potential $1.2 trillion increase in late December 2011, which was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The increase could have also been triggered by a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The debt limit faced a potential $1.2 trillion increase in late December 2011, subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The increase could have also been triggered by a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which failed to reach a consensus. The third increase in the debt limit was $1.2 trillion, matching the budget. The debt limit increase in late December 2011 was set at $1.2 trillion, matching budget reductions planned through sequestration. The Joint Select Committee failed to agree on recommendations, leading to this increase. Further analysis on debt limit developments can be found in CRS Report R43389. After the debt limit increase in late December 2011, policy developments continued. In 2012, the debt limit was suspended until May 19, 2013, through H.R. 325 (P.L. 113-3), which was passed by the House and Senate. Treasury Secretary Geithner utilized extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until mid-February to mid-March. On January 23, 2013, the House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013. The Senate also passed the measure on January 31, and it was signed into law on February 4. This allowed the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments and reset the debt limit at $16,699 billion on May 20, 2013. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit at $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than before. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, as the debt approached the limit. Lew sent updates to Congress on the expected exhaustion of borrowing capacity, pushing back the date. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit at $16,699 billion. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013. Secretary Lew sent notices to Congress with updated forecasts of the expected date of borrowing capacity exhaustion. Strong revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pushed back the exhaustion date. In September 25, 2013, letter to Congress, Secretary Lew projected borrowing capacity exhaustion no later than October 17. Congress passed a continuing resolution on the evening before October 17, 2013. On September 25, 2013, the U.S. Treasury projected it would exhaust its borrowing capacity by October 17. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014. After the suspension ended, the debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion, and the Treasury Secretary used extraordinary measures. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $17,212 billion. Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $17,212 billion. Congress approved a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015, which was signed into law by the President on February 15, 2014. The debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015, and Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures until the end of October 2015. After extending the debt limit until July 30, 2015, Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary powers until the end of October. He stated that these measures would allow the U.S. Treasury to meet financial obligations for a brief additional period after October. By October 15, 2015, Secretary Lew announced that these measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Treasury Secretary Lew announced that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected, leading to earlier depletion of funds than previously anticipated. Independent analysts initially projected that these measures would suffice until November or early December 2015, but more recent estimates in September 2015 pushed that date closer to mid-November 2015. Analysts initially projected that measures to meet federal obligations would last until November or early December 2015, but more recent estimates in September 2015 moved that date closer to mid-November 2015. A \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit, resetting it on March 16, 2017. The agreement prohibits the U.S. Treasury from creating a cash reserve beyond certain amounts. The debt limit would be reset on March 16, 2017, reflecting federal obligations during the suspension period. The agreement prohibits the U.S. Treasury from creating a cash reserve beyond necessary amounts. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law in November 2015, aiming to offset budget increases. Prior to this, from FY1998 to FY2001, the federal government had budget surpluses reducing its debt. Forecasts in early 2001 projected significant surpluses, raising concerns about the consequences of eliminating federal debt held by the public. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt. Forecasts in early 2001 projected large surpluses, but deficits emerged due to increased military and security spending post-9/11, rising nondefense outlays, and tax reductions in 2001 and 2003. The federal government faced deficits due to higher military and security spending post-9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions in 2001 and 2003, and the expiration of statutory caps on discretionary spending in 2002. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession further increased federal deficits, leading to the growth of total debt and necessitating debt limit increases. The growth of total debt led to a series of debt limit increases. The direct fiscal costs of a financial crisis are overshadowed by diminished tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. Fiscal sustainability concerns were prominent during the 2011 debt limit episode but have since decreased. Federal deficits have decreased as economic recovery progressed, with the FY2015 deficit at 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. Federal health program costs and net interest expenses have risen at a slower pace. The federal deficits have decreased as economic recovery progressed, with the FY2015 deficit at 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. Despite this improvement, without major policy changes, persistent deficits could substantially increase federal debt, leading to slower economic growth in the long run. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been warning about the unsustainable trajectory of federal borrowing, which could lead to slower economic growth in the long run as debt increases as a percentage of GDP. Without policy changes, Congress would need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt. Data on federal debt amounts and changes between September 2001 and September 2015 are provided in Table A-1. Table A-1 shows the increase in federal debt from September 2001 to September 2015. Total federal debt rose by $12,380 billion, with debt held by government accounts increasing by $2,566 billion. This growth in debt occurred after the last year of a federal budget surplus in FY2001. Total federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion since the end of FY2001, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion from September 2001 to September 2015."
