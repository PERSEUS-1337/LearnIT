    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act of 1994\". The Congress recognizes the Department of Energy's unique mathematics and science capabilities that contribute to education. There is a need to enhance collaboration between the Department of Energy, other federal agencies, and the mathematics and science education community, which includes nationally recognized teachers. The mathematics and science education community includes nationally recognized teachers who can provide insight into effective education programs. A pilot program has confirmed the effectiveness of these teachers serving in professional staff capacities in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Act aims to establish a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, who will be known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". The Act defines key terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit educational organization selected to administer the fellowship program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"outstanding\" refers to a mathematics or science teacher who has received national or state recognition. The teacher must have received national or state recognition comparable to the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, participated in the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program, or received a sabbatical leave to participate in the fellowship program under this Act. (B) has received a sabbatical leave to participate in the fellowship program under this Act, ensuring a return to a teaching position in the same school district. The term \"secondary school\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5. FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program allows the Secretary to provide fellowships to outstanding math or science teachers, with the possibility of reducing the number of fellowships based on funding availability. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program may reduce the number of fellowships awarded in a fiscal year if the appropriated amount is less than authorized. Priority is given to individuals selected under specific criteria for awarding fellowships. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program awards fellowships to outstanding math and science teachers in various government departments, including the Senate, House of Representatives, Department of Energy, and Department of Education. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program awards fellowships to outstanding math and science teachers in government departments such as the Department of Energy, Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and NASA for a 10-month term. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program awards 10-month fellowships to exceptional math and science teachers in government departments, including NASA. The program is administered by a contractor through a contract authorized by the Secretary. The contractor administers the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program, including developing the application process and promoting the program to teachers in various recognition programs. The contractor administers the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program by developing and administering an initial screening process for applicants from various recognition programs. The Einstein Fellowship Program selects 10 outstanding math and science teachers, administers the selection process, develops an orientation program for recipients, and oversees the program. The Einstein Fellowship Program oversees the selection process, develops an orientation program for recipients, and administers reporting and evaluation programs for fellowship recipients. The Einstein Fellowship Program oversees the selection process, develops an orientation program for recipients, and administers reporting and evaluation programs for fellowship recipients. The program requires annual reports to the Secretary, administration of funds, and agreements with educational agencies or school districts for fund disbursement to teachers. The Einstein Fellowship Program manages the selection process, orientation, and evaluation of fellowship recipients. Funds are used for recipient salaries, insurance contributions, and administrative expenses. The contractor may seek funding from non-Federal sources to establish an account for fellowship recipients' expenses such as travel and professional meetings. The contractor can seek funding from non-Federal sources to create an account for reimbursing fellowship recipients for travel and professional meeting expenses. The contractor will invite 20 semifinalists to Washington, D.C., for interviews after the initial screening process, with final selections announced before May 1 for each fellowship term. The final selections for fellowship recipients under this Act are made in accordance with a process developed by the contractor, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader each selecting a recipient assigned to the House of Representatives. The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate, along with their designees, select fellowship recipients for assignment to their respective chambers. Additionally, various government officials select recipients for placement in specific agencies. The Secretary of Energy, Education, NIH Director, NSF Director, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Policy, and NASA Administrator each select 1 fellowship recipient for placement within their department or agency. Each designee selects a fellowship recipient for placement within their department or agency. The recipient will interview in different sections before final placement, which must occur before the fellowship period begins. The fellowship recipients will be paid at a rate not exceeding GS-13 of the General Schedule. $550,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995, with additional funding for fiscal years 1996 through 2001."
