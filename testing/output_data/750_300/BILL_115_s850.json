    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for international medical schools to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act for students at foreign medical schools, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other international medical schools. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommend that all foreign medical schools should meet consistent requirements. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommends that all foreign graduate medical schools should meet the same eligibility requirements for Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act. The attrition rate at US medical schools is 3.4%, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools can reach 30%. Residency match rates for foreign trained doctors were reported in 2016. In 2014, the attrition rate at US medical schools was 3.4%, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools can reach 30%. In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates were 54% compared to 94% for US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduating students in a foreign medical school are not U.S. residents. At least 60 percent of graduates from foreign medical schools outside the US were not US residents in the year before applying for a loan under title IV. At least 75 percent of individuals from foreign medical schools outside the US passed the exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before applying for a loan under title IV. In the year prior to seeking a loan under title IV, foreign medical school graduates must have passed exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. The authority of a graduate medical school to qualify expires. The authority of a graduate medical school to qualify for loan programs under title IV expires after the enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, students enrolled before the enactment of the amendments can still receive loans while meeting academic progress requirements. Students can receive a loan under part D while attending a graduate medical school, as long as they continue to meet academic progress requirements. This eligibility lasts until the student withdraws, completes the program, or reaches the fourth June 30 after losing eligibility."
