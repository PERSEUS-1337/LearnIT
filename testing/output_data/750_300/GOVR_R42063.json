Unemployment may not immediately decrease when the economy picks up after a recession due to firms keeping underutilized employees on payroll to avoid costs of layoffs and rehiring. This phenomenon is known as a lagging economic indicator. Firms may retain underutilized employees to avoid costs of layoffs and rehiring during economic downturns. This can lead to a temporary increase in labor productivity as output rises to meet demand. However, once current labor is fully utilized, output growth is limited until firms start hiring again. Output growth in an economic expansion depends on the growth rates of labor supply and productivity. During economic expansion, output growth is determined by labor supply and productivity rates. If GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, employment will increase, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. There is a long-term negative relationship between real GDP growth rates and unemployment levels. In the long run, there is a negative relationship between real GDP growth rates and unemployment levels, as highlighted by economist Arthur Okun in the early 1960s. Okun's law states that stable unemployment rates require real GDP growth to be equal to potential output growth. This relationship has been widely accepted in the economics profession. The relationship between real GDP growth rates and unemployment levels, as highlighted by economist Arthur Okun in the early 1960s, states that stable unemployment rates require GDP growth equal to potential output growth. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. The rate of growth in potential output depends on productivity and labor supply at full employment. The output gap occurs when actual GDP falls short of potential GDP due to high unemployment rates. If GDP growth is lower than labor force growth, there won't be enough new jobs for all job seekers. If GDP growth falls below labor force growth, unemployment will rise. If GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment will fall. If GDP growth equals labor force growth with productivity growth, more people will be employed. If GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity, the unemployment rate will fall in the long run. Policymakers should be aware of this rate of GDP growth. The unemployment rate will rise unless GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Policymakers need to know the rate of GDP growth to implement stimulus policies to reduce unemployment. The growth rates of the labor force and productivity have changed over time, with the labor force growing at an average annual rate of 1.6% between 1950 and 2000. Between 1950 and 2000, the civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6%. The growth rate has slowed since then and is expected to continue doing so partly as a result of the aging of the baby-boom generation. Between 2000 and 2010, the annual rate of labor force growth fell to 0.8%. It is projected to fall further, to 0.7% per year on average, between 2010 and 2020. Predicting productivity growth is more difficult than predicting labor force growth. Between 1947 and 1973, productivity in the private nonfarm business sector grew at an annual rate of 2.8%. This rate slowed to 1.4% between 1973 and 1995, then accelerated to 2.9% between 1995 and 2005. However, since 2005, productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% will be needed to lower the unemployment rate if current trends continue. Since 2005, productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually. To lower the unemployment rate, real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed. According to Okun's law, a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment requires real GDP to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. The unemployment rate can decline when real GDP grows 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. It may take some time for the unemployment rate to start decreasing after an economic recovery. For example, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, it took over a year for the unemployment rate to begin steadily declining. The unemployment rate can take time to decline after an economic recovery. Following the end of 11 economic contractions, it has varied how long it took for the rate to start decreasing. For example, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, it took over a year for the unemployment rate to begin steadily declining, leading to jobless recoveries. The current recovery is closer to the high-end of the range in terms of the time it took for the rate to trend downward. The current recovery from the 2007-2009 recession is experiencing a jobless recovery, with the unemployment rate taking varying amounts of time to decline after past recessions. The slowest decline occurred after the recession that ended in November 2001. After eight of the eleven postwar recessions, it took at least eight months for the unemployment rate to fall by one full percentage point. The slowest decline occurred after the recession that ended in November 2001 when the unemployment rate stood at 5.5%. About 3\u00bd years elapsed before the unemployment rate fell one-half of a percentage point. In contrast, the expansion that followed the July 1981-November 1982 downturn began with the highest unemployment rate of the postwar period (10.8%). It took only eight months for the unemployment rate to fall more than one percentage point (to a still high 9.4%). The July 1981-November 1982 downturn started with a high unemployment rate of 10.8%, which fell to 9.4% in eight months. There is a debate on Okun's law and its applicability to economic growth and unemployment rate changes. Despite initial high growth rates, the unemployment rate stalled at around 9.0% in 2011 due to slow GDP growth. Despite slow GDP growth in 2011, the unemployment rate stalled at 9.0%. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, output growth accelerated, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate to 8.5% in December. The decline in the unemployment rate was greater than expected based on GDP growth. In 2011, despite slow GDP growth, the unemployment rate decreased more than expected. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board noted a disconnect between GDP growth and the decline in the unemployment rate. Bernanke suggested this may have compensated for a previous deviation from Okun's law in 2009. In 2009, workers were laid off and the unemployment rate rose beyond the level commensurate with the contraction in economic growth. McCarthy, Potter, and Ng at the New York Federal Reserve Bank estimated that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during the recovery periods after the three recessions before the 2007-2009 recession. Others also noted periods of instability in the relationship between economic growth rates and unemployment, possibly influenced by the stage of the business cycle. Based on their analysis, Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that the relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and output growth should not be taken too seriously but rather as an approximation. In contrast, Ball et al estimated increases and decreases in unemployment rate as posited by Okun. \"Calculations relating changes in unemployment rate to output growth should be seen as an approximation. Ball et al found that increases and decreases in output have the same effect on unemployment, consistent with Okun's theory. They also showed that Okun's law held during recent jobless recoveries, with the relationship between output and unemployment gaps aligning with predictions.\" Okun's law remained valid during recent jobless recoveries, with large output gaps persisting in the 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. Ball et al confirmed the relationship between output and unemployment gaps aligned with Okun's predictions, stating that Okun's Law has earned its name as a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship. The researchers confirm Okun's Law as a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship, noting its validity during jobless recoveries. Economist Robert J. Gordon predicts slower growth in potential GDP due to diminishing gains from information technology investments. Gordon predicts slower growth in potential GDP over the next 20 years at a rate of 2.4%, attributing this to diminishing gains from information technology investments. This could lead to a declining rate of unemployment if real economic growth exceeds 2.4%. Economists Basu and Fernald also analyze the outlook for potential output growth. Economists Basu and Fernald suggest that a decline in household net worth from the 2007-2009 recession may lead to a larger supply of labor in the near term, temporarily boosting growth in potential output. However, disruptions in financial markets are expected to constrain potential output growth in the short term. The supply of labor may be larger in the near term, temporarily raising growth in potential output. Disruptions in financial markets are expected to constrain growth in potential output due to higher investment risks. Estimates of potential output growth are uncertain. Weidner and Williams found rapid potential output growth in the 1960s-1980s. Weidner and Williams analyzed the relationship between real economic growth and past recoveries. They found that potential output growth was faster during the 1960s-1980s at 3.6%, compared to the more moderate growth of 2.5% in the recoveries from the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions. The slow rate of labor force growth led to a sluggish 2.1% potential GDP growth at the start of the Great Recession recovery. Real economic growth above 2.1% could result in a decrease in the unemployment rate. GDP growth during the recovery from the Great Recession was slow at 2.1% due to labor force growth. Real economic growth above 2.1% could lead to a decrease in the unemployment rate. The Congressional Budget Office projected a 2.2% average annual growth rate of potential output between 2012 and 2022, lower than the 3.3% rate between 1950 and 2011. The Congressional Budget Office projected a lower average annual growth rate of potential GDP at 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, compared to 3.3% between 1950 and 2011. This decrease is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, with the annual average rate of unemployment expected to remain above 8.0% through 2014 before falling to 5.9% by 2018. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the annual average growth rate of real GDP will stay below potential output until 2018. Unemployment is estimated to remain above 8.0% through 2014, then fall to 5.9% by 2017."
