    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school since the 1930s. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. WIA includes programs for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. Youth job training programs under WIA are carried out by the Department of Labor and include Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program is also carried out under WIA. These programs collectively form the federal job training system. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for youth through programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. WIA programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the future. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for youth through programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. WIA programs are funded through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the future. Policy makers in the 112th Congress signaled possible reauthorization of the law. This report discusses issues relevant to WIA youth programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps, and provisions of two bills: H.R. 803 and Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for youth through programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. H.R. 803 and S. 1356 are two bills that address job training and employment services for youth under WIA, including programs like Job Corps and YouthBuild. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 offers job training and services for youth through programs like Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG). The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training programs for youth, including Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG). The YOG program, funded through FY2003, created centers in low-income communities for youth employment services. Although WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for YOG which has not been funded since FY2003. All programs, except Job Corps, are managed by the Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration. Job Corps is administered by ETA's Office of Job Corps. The Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, and Youth Opportunity Grants are job training programs for youth funded through the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. These programs aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities, with YouthBuild specifically targeting high school dropouts. Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild are managed by the Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration, while Job Corps is administered by ETA's Office of Job Corps. The programs, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants, aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities. YouthBuild specifically targets high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Each program provides employment and educational services differently, with specific requirements for elements like mentoring and follow-up under the Youth Activities program. The Youth Activities program, YouthBuild program, Job Corps, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program provide employment and educational services to low-income youth. Each program has distinct elements and activities, such as mentoring, construction work, and residential services. Job Corps is the only program offering residential services for youth, providing onsite living and employment/educational support. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program includes mentoring, education, and reentry services for youth transitioning from secure facilities. Funding for Youth Activities is allocated by DOL to states, which then distribute it to local WIBs. Job Corps centers are operated through agreements with nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Youth Activities funding is distributed by DOL to states, which then allocate it to local WIBs. Job Corps centers are operated through agreements with nonprofit and for-profit organizations. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is working on reauthorizing WIA. For more information on these programs, refer to CRS Report R40929, Vulnerable Youth: Employment and Job Training Programs. The program awards grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is taking steps to reauthorize the WIA youth programs, with recent hearings addressing various issues. The Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions to discuss the positive aspects of WIA and potential reauthorization legislation. The Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee held listening sessions and hearings in 2009 to address the positive aspects of WIA and discuss potential updates to help workers and employers in a changing economy. During 2009, hearings were held to update the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the needs of a changing economy. In 2011 and 2012, discussions focused on modernizing job training programs and reauthorizing WIA with the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297). The committee held hearings on updating job training programs and modernizing WIA in 2011 and 2012. Legislation to reauthorize WIA was discussed and reported favorably in June 2012. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education ordered reported the SKILLS Act. In June 2011, legislation to amend and reauthorize WIA was introduced but did not progress. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education ordered reported the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House on March 15, 2013. The Workforce Training legislation, H.R. 803, was discussed and approved by the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The bill was later passed by the House and introduced in the Senate as the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). Key issues in the WIA reauthorization process include proposals by policymakers. The Senate HELP Committee marked up S. 1356 on July 31, 2013, ordering the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3. Issues in the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth to make them more efficient and cost-effective. Some stakeholders argue that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups could be overlooked under a consolidated approach. Advocates for consolidation argue that it could make workforce programs more efficient and cost-effective, but some stakeholders are concerned that at-risk youth and other vulnerable populations may be overlooked. Suggestions include considering the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies like youth councils to address the needs of youth. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems, such as education, is also seen as crucial to meeting the varied needs of youth as intended by WIA. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, such as education. They believe that better coordination can help meet the diverse needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress is also interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only Job Corps having undergone an impact evaluation so far. An evaluation of YouthBuild is currently underway. Congress is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with a recent impact evaluation of Job Corps completed. A contract has been awarded to conduct an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. Concerns have been raised about income eligibility requirements for Youth Activities, with some stakeholders noting challenges in proving eligibility for needy youth. State and local workforce officials are debating the income eligibility requirements for youth programs, with concerns about excluding needy youth and challenges in proving income. There is also a discussion on whether the program should focus on serving older youth, particularly those aged 22 to 24. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22-24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders are debating whether the program should target older youth and focus on out-of-school youth, including those who are not working. Congress is considering proposals for federal funding for these initiatives. The Youth Activities program is under debate regarding its focus on out-of-school youth and the age eligibility for the program. Congress is considering proposals for federal funding for Job Corps centers due to concerns about mixed performance outcomes and low-performing centers. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found overlapping services in federal workforce programs. The 2011 Government Accountability Office report identified overlapping services in federal workforce programs, recommending consolidation of selected programs. The Government Accountability Office recommended consolidating selected federal workforce programs, including the Employment Service and training services under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate multiple workforce programs. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate multiple workforce programs, including Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. The 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities, including Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. Job Corps would remain a stand-alone program with substantive changes. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, incorporating existing core and intensive services along with additional services. The bill aims to provide work-ready services in the one-stop delivery system for youth, including assessment, job search assistance, career planning, and case management. Funding allocation to states and local areas would be based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. States must set aside some funding for youth workforce training. The bill aims to distribute funding to local workforce areas based on specific factors, with a portion set aside for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including youth aged 16 or older from low-income families. States can award grants to provide employment and training services to these individuals as part of their workforce plans. States could award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services to individuals aged 16 or older from low-income families. State and local workforce investment boards would be required to describe strategies and services to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for the labor market. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth aged 16-24 in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for the labor market, including dropout recovery activities and internships in in-demand industries. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth aged 16-24 in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for the labor market, including dropout recovery activities and internships in in-demand industries. The bill would define \"at-risk youth\" as those ages 16 through 24 who are low-income and high school dropouts, youth in foster care, youth offenders, youth with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Chairman Kline stated that consolidating workforce programs would eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs while ensuring accountability. Some concerns have been raised about the proposed WIF potentially serving fewer youth. Chairman Kline emphasized the need to consolidate workforce programs to eliminate duplication and inefficiency, ensuring accountability. Some policymakers are concerned that the proposed WIF may serve fewer youth due to the lack of a set-aside funding for youth programs. S. 1356 would maintain existing youth programs and introduce Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for competitive state grants. S. 1356 would maintain youth programs and introduce Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for competitive state grants to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers in serving youth if youth programs are consolidated with other workforce programs. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting youth to job training and employment services, even if they are not eligible for specific programs. These centers, which currently serve nearly 20 federal programs, use various methods to attract youth, as highlighted in a 2002 GAO report on the Youth Activities program. One-stop centers attract youth through various methods like active recruitment, staff placement, and training. However, some areas struggle to attract youth without referrals from schools or service providers. Some local areas face challenges attracting youth to one-stop centers, as youth typically only come when referred by schools or service providers. Recommendations include catering more to youth, training service professionals on youth matters, and providing funding to enhance youth connections to the one-stop delivery system. The Department of Labor (DOL) has encouraged one-stop centers to target youth by providing funding for planning projects and guidance on enhancing youth connections to the one-stop delivery system. This includes methods like co-locating youth program staff, coordinating outreach, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" Under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, states would be required to continue funding one-stop centers to provide job search and other assistance for youth. The bills do not specify how youth would be served at these centers, but there is a focus on customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly\" and potentially establishing separate satellite centers for youth. Additionally, the role of youth councils in developing workforce plans for eligible youth is being considered. The role of youth councils in developing workforce plans for eligible youth is being considered. Members of the youth council include representatives from various agencies and parents of eligible youth seeking assistance through WIA's grant programs. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Some councils struggle to engage youth and parents due to participation barriers. Some youth councils have difficulty developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) due to challenges in engaging youth and parents, such as lack of transportation and conflicting schedules. Innovative youth councils have overcome these barriers by establishing intermediary organizations with strong reputations and infrastructure. Some conditions for developing youth councils include the presence of an established intermediary organization with a strong reputation, a school-to-career partnership, and a community-wide planning process. These conditions aim to facilitate youth activities under the Youth program and leverage WIA dollars with other funds. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, enabling greater flexibility in partnerships and priorities. They suggest councils develop a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and consolidate funding streams. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils in coordinating activities and consolidating funding streams. Legislation may make youth councils optional and not require local workforce boards to have youth representatives, but state boards would need to have representatives with youth interests. H.R. 803 would require state boards to have representatives with youth interests and address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and require them to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee would assist with planning and operational issues related to youth services. The bill would require LWDBs to establish three standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee must include community-based organizations with a successful track record in serving eligible youth. Existing entities can fulfill the committee requirements if they meet the necessary criteria. The bill requires LWDBs to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. Existing entities can fulfill the committee requirements if they meet the necessary criteria. Congress may want to consider best practices from existing youth councils to improve coordination between the workforce and education systems. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIA) aims to improve coordination between the workforce and education systems by requiring local boards to have representatives from education entities and youth councils to establish linkages with educational agencies. Stakeholders believe greater coordination can better meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. The Youth Activities program under WIA requires local boards to establish linkages with educational agencies for youth programs. Stakeholders believe greater coordination can meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA, as discussed in a Senate HELP Committee listening session. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted collaboration between workforce and education systems, along with areas needing improvement. The 2004 Government Accountability Office report on the Youth Activities program highlighted collaboration between workforce and education systems, focusing on the entities local WIBs contract with to provide services to youth. About half of all youth received services through community-based organizations, secondary schools, and colleges. However, some education entities were cautious about partnering according to the report. Some education entities were cautious about partnering with the Youth Activities program, as they believed it conflicted with schools' mission to provide academic services to all youth. In Wisconsin, schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds due to the perceived stigma of it being targeted only to at-risk youth. In Wisconsin, schools were hesitant to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds due to the perceived stigma of it being targeted only to at-risk youth. At a July 2009 hearing, the Under Secretary of Education and Assistant Secretary of Labor testified about the commitment to ensuring all youth receive necessary services and supports. Collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education on education and workforce activities was highlighted. The Department of Labor and Department of Education collaborate to provide services and support for youth, whether in-school or out-of-school. The School-to-Work program was a successful example of their partnership, offering grants for work-based learning and job training programs. Congress could learn from this program's successes and challenges in fostering partnerships between the two agencies. The grants supported programs combining work-based learning in schools, school-based learning in the workplace, and job training. H.R. 803, passed by the House in 2013, includes provisions for workforce and education system coordination, but it is not explicit. The bill H.R. 803 includes provisions for workforce and education system coordination, allowing local areas to include education officials on the local workforce investment board to assist youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market. This could facilitate coordination between the workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 addresses coordination between the workforce and education systems by requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA. The Unified State Plan required under the Senate bill S. 1356 covers programs authorized under Titles I and II of WIA, including Youth Activities, Adult Activities, Dislocated Workers, adult education, Employment Service, and vocational rehabilitation. States have the option to submit a unified plan that includes elements like an analysis of economic conditions and goals for workforce preparation. Congress and stakeholders are concerned about the effectiveness of youth programs authorized under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. Evaluations of these programs are limited, but they are measured against common performance metrics. The three major youth programs - Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild - have met or exceeded their goals under the common performance measures. Evaluations are required under Section 172 of WIA to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these programs. The Department of Labor (DOL) is required to continuously evaluate programs and activities authorized under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to assess their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Legislation from the 113th Congress would mandate independent evaluations of WIA-funded programs every five years. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of these programs, as noted in a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Legislation from the 113th Congress, H.R. 803, would require the Department of Labor to conduct independent evaluations of programs funded under the Workforce Investment Act every five years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted the lack of information on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few undergoing impact studies since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine program outcomes. The Government Accountability Office report identified five programs not authorized under WIA, making it difficult for policymakers to assess their effectiveness. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants. The Youth Activities program under WIA lacks formal evaluation for impacts on participants. A few studies have focused on program implementation. An impact evaluation of YouthBuild is underway, with initial results expected in 2015. The Department of Labor (DOL) has contracted a research organization to evaluate the impact of YouthBuild program on youth employment. Initial results are expected in 2015. DOL also completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to identify practices associated with center performance. The evaluation of the YouthBuild program and Job Corps program identified key factors related to center performance measures, including job placement rate and post-program earnings. Factors such as robust student support and staff accountability were associated with strong performance. The Job Corps program was rigorously evaluated in the late 1990s through the early 2000s to determine its impact on youth ages 16 through 24. Positive outcomes were found for youth enrolled in Job Corps, including strong performance factors like robust student support and staff accountability. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s on youth aged 16-24. Positive outcomes in education and employment were found, but long-term impacts showed diminished employment effects, with similar rates and earnings between program and control groups. The research evaluated the Job Corps program on youth aged 16-24, showing positive outcomes in education and employment initially. However, long-term effects revealed similar employment rates and earnings between program and control groups. Additionally, the study found increased earnings for older youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application, with benefits outweighing costs. The discussion also includes performance measures specified for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and the directive for the DOL Secretary to identify measures for the YouthBuild program. The discussion includes an overview of performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild program. Concerns have been raised about disincentives for serving youth with barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, would eliminate current youth core performance measures and add new ones. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new indicators for individuals participating in Workforce Investment Fund activities. These new measures would assess entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, and changes in median earnings of participants. The new indicators for individuals participating in Workforce Investment Fund activities include measuring entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, changes in median earnings, attainment of industry-recognized credentials, participation in education or training programs leading to credentials, and employment in a related field. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities programs, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in these activities, earnings for employed youth, attainment of credentials or diploma, participation in education or training programs, and skills gains towards education or training. The DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on six indicators for youth in WIA Youth Activities programs, including education, training, employment entry and retention, earnings, credential attainment, participation in programs, and skills gains. States may add more indicators as needed. The DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on six indicators for youth in WIA Youth Activities programs. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities funded under this subtitle. The accountability system under WIA assesses the effectiveness of States and local areas in improving workforce investment activities to optimize the return on Federal funds. State performance measures include core indicators for youth aged 14-18 and 19-21, such as basic skills attainment, secondary school diplomas, and placement and retention. The core indicators for youth aged 14-18 and 19-21 under WIA include basic skills attainment, secondary school diplomas, postsecondary education or employment for younger youth, and employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment for older youth. States negotiate performance levels with DOL for each indicator. Stakeholders have raised concerns about this process. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to prioritize higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars have been reported to only accept youth who meet certain criteria. The Government Accountability Office found that some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted youth at specific grade levels to meet program goals. Department of Labor officials were aware that program contracts may unintentionally discourage working with lower-skilled youth due to short timeframes. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to address program contracts that may discourage working with lower-skilled youth by implementing strategies like multiyear contracting and using real-time indicators to assess provider performance. The 2010 guidance from the Department of Labor emphasized six key strategies for improving youth programs, including multiyear contracting, basing enrollment goals on total participant count, using real-time indicators for provider performance assessment, considering participant characteristics in goal negotiations, incentivizing enrollment of at-risk youth, and promoting interagency collaboration. The 2010 Department of Labor guidance emphasized six key strategies for improving youth programs, including multiyear contracting, using real-time indicators for provider performance assessment, considering participant characteristics in goal negotiations, incentivizing enrollment of at-risk youth, and promoting interagency collaboration. The report by GAO also suggested common measures for local programs to have more flexibility in working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Common measures provide flexibility for programs to work with youth at different ability levels. The DOL guidance suggests using indicators like learning gain and grade level improvement for youth programs. Some recommend adjusting performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act could inform adjustments for serving the neediest youth under WIA reauthorization. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) allowed for adjustments to national performance standards for serving challenging youth populations in different local areas. Governors could adjust standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) based on economic and demographic factors, similar to local workforce investment boards. This process could provide insight into how adjustments could be made for serving the neediest youth under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) reauthorization. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) allowed for adjustments to national performance standards for serving challenging youth populations in different local areas. Governors could adjust standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) based on economic and demographic factors. This process aimed to level the playing field across areas with different local conditions. WIA requires Job Corps to establish more than 20 core performance metrics covering a range of outcomes. Under JTPA, adjustments to national performance standards were allowed for serving challenging youth populations in different local areas. WIA mandates Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures like entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. Additionally, DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess program performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act. The DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act. A 2011 report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results and targets for some metrics by the Office of Job Corps. The Office of Job Corps reported inaccurate performance metrics, failed to establish targets for some metrics, and did not publish required results. The cost of each program participant was also miscalculated. YouthBuild program applicants must include a description of results to be achieved, as required by WIA. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. Additional indicators may be required by the Secretary. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. DOL will provide details of the performance indicators in administrative guidance. The retention rate includes individuals who exit the program and are placed in employment, post-secondary education, or training in the first quarter after exit and remain in employment or education in the third quarter after exit. The retention rate for the YouthBuild program measures the number of individuals who exit and are placed in employment, education, or training in the first quarter after exit and remain in employment or education in the third quarter after exit. The recidivism rate tracks participants re-arrested or re-incarcerated within one year of enrollment, excluding those released without conviction. Stakeholders have been evaluating program effectiveness since its inception. Under H.R. 803, the reauthorization legislation passed by the House in March 2013, states and local areas would need to have strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals facing barriers to employment. Stakeholders are discussing eligibility criteria for the YouthBuild program, including the emphasis on serving out-of-school and older youth. The program's retention rate measures successful placement in employment, education, or training, while the recidivism rate tracks re-arrests or re-incarcerations within one year of enrollment, excluding those released without conviction. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would need strategies to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment. Out-of-school youth aged 16-24 are included, with no specific percentage or funding requirement. Youth Activities program eligibility includes age 14-21, low-income status, and barriers like basic literacy skills deficiency. The Youth Activities formula program provides funding for services for low-income individuals aged 14-21 with barriers to employment. Eligibility criteria include basic literacy skills deficiency, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy or parenting, offender status, or need for additional educational or employment assistance. Discussions have centered around the requirement for youth to prove their low-income status. The WIA Youth program's eligibility requirement for low-income status has been a point of discussion. The Government Accountability Office found that many eligible youth struggle to provide necessary income documentation, such as parents' paycheck stubs or tax returns. Many eligible youth struggle to provide income documentation for the WIA Youth program, diverting resources from service delivery. State and local officials noted challenges in obtaining necessary documentation. According to GAO, state and local workforce officials mentioned that youth face difficulties providing required documents for WIA program eligibility, and income requirements may exclude some needy youth. Additionally, youth may struggle to prove eligibility under other WIA criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the justice system, or being homeless or runaways. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria for youth under WIA. DOL can waive statutory or regulatory requirements for states or local areas, but not for participant eligibility. This limitation affects states and localities seeking waivers for youth who are homeless, runaways, or have difficulty providing required documents. Under WIA, DOL can waive certain requirements for states or local areas, but not for participant eligibility. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not allow flexibility in documenting income and other factors. Some stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not allow flexibility in documenting income and other eligibility factors. States and localities have preferred using certain eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), such as in-school youth qualifying for the federal free lunch program or participating in Title I programs for low-income school districts. The Training Partnership Act (JTPA) determined eligibility for in-school youth based on participation in the federal free lunch program or Title I programs for low-income school districts. Out-of-school youth were eligible if economically disadvantaged. Other stakeholders suggest adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty areas. Youth in Youth Opportunity grant program sites were automatically eligible. Some stakeholders propose expanding eligibility for at-risk youth in the WIA program, including dropouts, foster care youth, homeless youth, and those not in school or working, regardless of income. The goal is to serve the most vulnerable youth, but the impact of changing eligibility to a means-tested program is uncertain. The eligibility for at-risk youth in the WIA program, including homeless and runaway youth, should be categorically based without regard to income. Stakeholders question whether changing eligibility to a means-tested program would affect the number of eligible youth or if those with more opportunities would receive services. There is also debate on whether the program should focus more on out-of-school youth, including those who are not working. The Youth Activities program under WIA requires 30% of funds to be used for out-of-school youth, but challenges in recruiting and retaining them persist according to GAO reports from 2002 and 2004. The 2002 and 2004 GAO reports found challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth for local youth programs under WIA. Serving out-of-school youth is twice as costly as serving in-school youth, with difficulties in maintaining contact and transportation. Stakeholders suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth. Some stakeholders propose allocating a greater share of WIA Youth funding to out-of-school youth and high-risk in-school youth, prioritizing those who are not in school or lack enough credits to graduate. Prior legislation aimed to serve primarily out-of-school youth, citing challenges in maintaining contact and transportation. The use of WIA funds should prioritize in-school youth who lack enough credits to graduate. Some argue for maintaining current funding for out-of-school youth but increasing technical assistance. Flexibility is needed for localities to determine the optimal funding share. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school youth. DOL has provided guidance to states and localities on serving out-of-school youth and in-school youth at risk of dropping out, recommending strong alternative education programs. Additionally, DOL funded the Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants under WIA's pilot and demonstration authority. In FY2007, DOL provided $3.4 million to seven midsize cities to implement a system that can reconnect youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. Additionally, a 2004 report for DOL addressed the implementation of WIA programs for out-of-school youth, highlighting successful strategies such as providing technical assistance through a training and technical assistance network. In 2004, a report for DOL discussed successful strategies for serving out-of-school youth through WIA programs. States provided technical assistance, resources, and contracted service providers for GED, high school diploma, and vocational training programs. Some Job Corps centers and local areas partner with service providers to offer GED, high school diploma, and vocational training programs for out-of-school youth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded WIA Youth services to include individuals up to age 24 to address youth unemployment. The WIA Youth services have been expanded to include individuals up to age 24 to address youth unemployment. Research suggests that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and high living costs. Vulnerable youth face additional challenges such as family conflict and obstacles to independence. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth is complicated by challenges like family conflict and employment obstacles. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. Reauthorization legislation could address targeting older disconnected youth in the WIA program. Increasing the age of youth in the WIA program to target older disconnected individuals may strain resources if funding remains stable. A report by GAO found that 7% of youth in the program were ages 22 through 24, indicating a potential influx of youth seeking services if the age limit is expanded. Approximately 7% of the 300,000 youth in the ARRA-funded Youth program were ages 22 through 24, totaling about 21,000 youth. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both the Youth and Adult Activities programs to meet individual needs, such as mentoring services under the Youth program and eligibility for an individual training account under the Adult program. Older youth can receive mentoring services under the Youth program and be eligible for an individual training account (ITA) under the Adult program. It is unclear how youth ages 18-21 choose to participate in either program or both. Exiters ages 19-21 in the Youth program increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% in a recent period covering 2012-2013. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% in 2012-2013, compared to 10% in the Adult Activities program for youth ages 18-21. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring, while the Adult program focuses on mentoring and individual training accounts. The Adult program in the Adult Activities program provides information about available dropout services and combines workplace training with related instruction. The Youth program focuses on academic services, leadership skills development, and community service activities. The Adult program offers workplace training with related instruction, while the Youth program focuses on leadership skills development and community service activities. Both programs provide opportunities for occupational skills training and links to employment, but the emphasis on leadership and community service is unique to the Youth program. The Adult program offers workplace training and job counseling during the intensive phase, while the Youth program focuses on leadership skills development and community service activities. The Adult program provides referrals to supportive services like child care and transportation, while the Youth program offers adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse. The Youth program offers adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse, while the Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. DOL published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance ratings. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering criteria for closing low-performing centers, including performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, exempting certain centers from closure and considering the impact on specific student subpopulations. The closures are part of DOL's reform agenda to improve center performance through federal oversight. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. The closures are not driven by cost but by the need to maximize results for students and taxpayers. The comment period for the closure proposal ended in February 2013, with no further information provided as of February 2014. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to improve performance for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and close underperforming centers based on certain performance criteria. The bill H.R. 803 aims to develop a program improvement plan for centers reporting less than 50% on performance indicators. It includes provisions to close low-performing centers based on specific criteria. The DOL Secretary will conduct an audit ranking centers by performance and incidents of violence. A report to Congress will detail findings and conclusions from the audit. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close low-performing Job Corps centers based on specific criteria. The DOL Secretary will rank centers by performance and incidents of violence, with a report to Congress detailing findings and conclusions. Reagan Administration had similar proposals in the past to improve program efficiency. The Reagan Administration proposed closing Job Corps centers to improve efficiency, but they were not ultimately closed. Legislation in the 104th Congress also aimed to close underperforming centers based on criteria like program outcomes and incidents of violence. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on various criteria, including center performance, incidents of violence, and cost. The proposal also suggested transferring operation of Job Corps from the federal government to states, but states would not be required to have Job Corps centers. The 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming Job Corps centers and transferring operations to states, believing states are best suited to manage centers integrated with their workforce systems. Some Members objected, fearing states could reduce student numbers or limit access to programs outside their state. Both House and Senate bills passed without convening a conference committee to resolve differences. The 104th Congress proposed closing underperforming Job Corps centers and transferring operations to states, with concerns about limiting access to programs outside states. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would give the Secretary authority to close centers and change performance indicators. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would empower the Secretary to close underperforming centers, establish new performance metrics, and implement a performance improvement plan within a one-year timeframe. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would require the DOL Secretary to develop a performance improvement plan (PIP) within a one-year period. Common measures, including employment placement and education attainment, are used across various workforce programs. ETA first implemented common measures in 2003 for workforce programs. The common measures, including employment placement and education attainment, were first implemented by ETA in 2003 for various workforce programs. ETA introduced three measures for youth programs, such as Youth Activities and Job Corps, and has since issued additional policy guidance on the common measures. These measures aim to collect, record, and report program performance for workforce programs. ETA introduced common measures in 2003 for youth programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. These measures aim to streamline data collection for program performance assessment under the Government Performance and Results Act. The common measures introduced by ETA in 2003 aim to streamline data collection for program performance assessment under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The goals and outcomes of these measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs are included in Table A-1, with data for PY2011 and PY2012. The goals for the common measures are established as part of the budget process. The table includes data for PY2011 and PY2012 for YouthBuild based on aggregated program data from the 2007 grant cycle. DOL sets ambitious goals for common measures, adjusting them for individual grantees as needed. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. DOL develops performance targets for programs using regression analysis, incorporating factors like prior year results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics for Youth Activities. Performance targets for YouthBuild are based on various factors. The performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are set based on regression analysis using factors like program results, labor market conditions, and economic assumptions. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012. The performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are set based on economic assumptions, program results, and unemployment. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012. Placement in Employment or Education measures the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed in the first quarter after the program. The placement measure for YouthBuild and Job Corps refers to the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed in the first quarter after the program. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after the exit quarter.

The term diploma includes credentials equivalent to a high school diploma, as well as Associate's and Bachelor's degrees earned from various educational programs. Work readiness certificates are not considered diplomas. The measure of Literacy or Numeracy Gains focuses on the percentage of youth participants who increase their educational functional levels after completing a year in the program. This measure excludes youth in postsecondary school and those with work readiness certificates. The measure of Literacy or Numeracy Gains focuses on the percentage of youth participants who increase their educational functional levels after completing a year in the program. This measure is calculated based on initial assessments in reading, writing, and math, with pre-tests administered up to six months prior to the first service received. If prior scores are unavailable, tests must be taken within 60 days of receiving a service. Youth are then tested at regular intervals after entering the program. The measure of Literacy or Numeracy Gains focuses on youth participants increasing their educational functional levels after a year in the program. Pre-tests are administered up to six months before the first service, with follow-up tests at regular intervals. Individuals not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on those needing remediation. DOL provides guidance on test types for assessing gains. The measure excludes individuals not basic skills-deficient to focus on youth needing remediation and to ease testing burden.
