    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose to rescind funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for similar authority as Governor of Texas. President George W. Bush advocated for the item veto as Governor of Texas and later as President, pushing for the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to address excessive earmark projects. The proposed expedited rescission process aimed to prevent Congress from ignoring presidential recommendations for funding cuts. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) was introduced to Congress on March 6, 2006, proposing expedited rescission to require a vote by at least one house on presidential funding cut recommendations. Enhanced rescission, previously available under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President in spending reductions. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 introduced \"enhanced rescission,\" which favored the President in spending reductions by creating a presumption in their favor. Under this framework, spending cuts identified in special presidential messages would remain permanently cancelled unless Congress enacted a disapproval bill. If the President vetoed the disapproval bill, a two-thirds majority in both chambers would be needed to override the veto. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. Expedited rescission bills aim to streamline the process of approving the President's spending cuts by implementing fast-track procedures in Congress. This approach requires congressional approval to rescind funding but encourages a prompt up-or-down vote on the President's proposal. It is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other methods. The expedited rescission approach aims to streamline the process of approving the President's spending cuts by implementing fast-track procedures in Congress. It requires congressional approval to rescind funding but encourages a prompt up-or-down vote on the President's proposal. This approach is viewed as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other methods. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills in multiple years, with specific details on the process outlined in the 102nd Congress. H.R. 2164, passed in 1992, allowed the President to propose rescissions within three days of signing an appropriations act. Rescissions couldn't reduce a program below the previous year's budget or by more than 25% for a new program. H.R. 1578 in 1993 had no limit on rescission amounts, allowing the President to request 100% funding cuts for a program. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 1578 allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding with expedited judicial review. H.R. 1578 also detailed fast-track procedures for expedited consideration of a rescission's substitute. In the second session of the 103rd Congress, H.R. 4600 passed the House in 1994 with a substitute amendment for expedited rescission. The bill allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time but required separate messages for each appropriations subcommittee. H.R. 4600 in the 103rd Congress allowed for expedited rescission with separate messages for each appropriations subcommittee. The bill also authorized special messages proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. A motion to strike any proposed rescission or repeal could be made with support from 50 Members in the House or 15 in the Senate. On March 7, 2006, a draft expedited rescission bill was submitted by the White House. The White House introduced a draft expedited rescission bill titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 as H.R. 4890 and S. 2381 on March 7, 2006. The bill proposed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by adding a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto\" allowing the President to propose rescission of discretionary budget amounts in a special message to Congress. The Administration bill proposed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by inserting a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto.\" This would authorize the President to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or repeal targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting and packaging these special messages, with no time constraints on the number of items included. The LLIVA allows the President flexibility in submitting special messages for rescission of budget authority or direct spending items. There are no time constraints, and multiple rescissions can be included in one message. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction, and committee allocations must be adjusted within five days of approval. The LLIVA allows the President flexibility in submitting special messages for rescission of budget authority or direct spending items. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction, and committee allocations must be adjusted within five days of approval. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures, with adjustments made to committee allocations and spending caps. The President's proposed bill allows for fast-track procedures for rescission requests, with a quick timeline for introduction and committee review. If the committee fails to report the bill within five days, it will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar for a vote by the 10th day of the session. The President's proposed bill includes fast-track procedures for rescission requests, with a strict timeline for committee review and approval. Failure to meet reporting deadlines results in automatic discharge from consideration, with a vote required by the 10th day of the session. Limited debate time and restrictions on amendments are also outlined. The bill allows the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission for up to 180 days. The LLIVA bill introduces expedited procedural rules for the approval of rescission requests. It allows the President to withhold budget authority for up to 180 days and suspend the execution of direct spending items for the same period. This provision is unique to expedited rescission bills and gives the President the option to release funds before the 180-day deadline. The LLIVA bill introduces expedited procedural rules for rescission requests, allowing the President to withhold funds or suspend spending for 180 days. Supporters argue it provides temporary withholding until Congress can review the President's proposal, while others see it as potentially abusive and unnecessary. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill argue that it could lead to the return of policy deferrals and potentially allow the President to initiate multiple 180-day withholding periods, which they view as unnecessary and subject to abuse. They suggest that a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on a special message from the President. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill argue that it could potentially allow the President to initiate multiple withholding periods, which they view as unnecessary and subject to abuse. They suggest a shorter period for Congress to act on a special message. Supporters stress that the 180-day provision is the maximum deferral period, with the option for the President to release funds earlier if needed. Supporters of the 180-day provision in the LLIVA bill emphasize that it is the maximum period for funding deferral, with the President having the option to release funds earlier if necessary. The bill language allows for early release if the President deems it necessary, but does not mandate it, even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA also states that its provisions are severable, meaning that if any part is found unconstitutional, the rest remains in force for judicial review. The LLIVA bill allows for a 180-day funding deferral period, with the President having the option to release funds earlier if needed. The provisions of the bill are severable, meaning that if any part is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains in force for judicial review. The act would apply only to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Several other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress. Several expedited rescission measures, including the LLIVA bill (H.R. 4890 / S. 2381) and H.R. 2290 introduced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, have been proposed in the 109th Congress. These measures allow the President to propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in appropriations acts and reduce discretionary spending limits. The President can propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in appropriations acts and reduce discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. H.R. 2290 limits the President to one message per appropriations act, unless it includes accounts from multiple appropriations subcommittees. H.R. 2290 would limit the President to one message per appropriations act, unless it includes accounts from multiple appropriations subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699, the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (or SLICE Act) of 2006,\" to enable the President to require Congress to debate. The \"SLICE Act of 2006\" (H.R. 4699) aims to allow the President to propose spending cuts for Congress to debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for budget authority in appropriations acts or P.L. 109-59. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, allowing the President to propose spending cuts for specific projects in the transportation act. The Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, introduced by Senator John Kerry, allows the President to propose spending cuts for specific projects in the transportation act. The President can propose spending cuts for specific projects within three days of a law's enactment. The process includes submitting a special message with draft bills for cancellations, with expedited procedures for a vote within 10 days. Representative John Spratt is involved in the House Budget. H.R. 5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, proposes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to cancel discretionary spending and limited tax benefits through a special message. Mandatory spending would not be affected. H.R. 5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, would allow the President to propose cancellation of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions through a special message. It includes expedited procedures for congressional consideration, allowing a separate vote on spending items or tax provisions by a limited number of members. On June 14, 2006, the House Budget Committee approved H.R. 4890 (the Administration's rescission proposal) by a vote of 24-9. The Rules Committee then voted 8-4 to report an amended version. The House later approved H.R. 4890 by a vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg and others in the Senate also discussed the proposal. The House Budget Committee approved H.R. 4890 by a vote of 24-9, and the Rules Committee voted 8-4 to report an amended version. The House later approved the bill by a vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg and others in the Senate introduced the Stop Over Spending Act, including a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. Senator Gregg and others introduced bill S. 3521 on June 15, 2006, which was later marked up and favorably voted on by the Senate Budget Committee. A comparative overview of expedited rescission bills, including H.R. 4890 and Title I of S. 3521, is provided in Table 1 at the end of the report. Relevant provisions from the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 are also included in the comparison. Title I of S. 3521, as amended by the Senate Budget Committee, includes provisions that differ from the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. Changes in H.R. 4890/S. 2381 have reduced the President's flexibility, such as setting a deadline for special rescission messages. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 requires special messages to be submitted within 45 days. The committee bills aim to limit the President's flexibility by setting deadlines for special rescission messages. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 requires messages to be submitted within 45 days, while S. 3521 allows submission up to one year after enactment. The Senate Budget Committee version limits the President to four special messages per year, compared to the House version's limit of five per act or 10 for omnibus measures. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President to submit up to five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures, with a deadline of 45 days. In contrast, the Senate bill permits up to four special messages per calendar year, with a submission deadline of up to one year after enactment. The Senate bill also allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days after submitting a special message, regardless of congressional action. The LLIVA bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days after submitting a special message, with no sunset termination date. In contrast, the House-passed version limits withholding to 45 days, with a possible 45-day extension, and includes a sunset termination date after six years. S. 3521 also limits withholding to 45 days. The LLIVA bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days with no sunset termination date. In contrast, the House-passed version limits withholding to 45 days, with a possible 45-day extension, and includes a sunset termination date after six years. S. 3521 also limits withholding to 45 days, with a termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521, as ordered to be reported, narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. H.R. 4890 focuses on revenue-losing provisions affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify targeted tax benefits, while the House-passed version would require the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to identify such provisions. The President could propose a rescission of identified tax benefits, with H.R. 4890/S. 2381 allowing the President to propose any targeted tax benefit he identified. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 allows the President to propose targeted tax benefits he identifies. It also includes changes related to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, repealing it except for certain sections. The bill would also amend Title X of the Impoundment Control Act. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 would repeal the Impoundment Control Act, except for specific sections. The bill aims to amend Title X of the Impoundment Control Act by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and replacing it with new text. The current bills propose expedited rescission procedures that could potentially enhance or replace the President's existing rescission authority under the Impoundment Control Act. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 aims to amend the Impoundment Control Act by proposing expedited rescission procedures that could enhance the President's existing authority. A manager's amendment clarified that any cancelled funds from a trust or special fund would be returned to the original fund. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee amendment in H.R. 4890 clarified that cancelled funds from trust or special funds would be returned to the original fund. Changes in the bill occurred during committee markups, with a manager's amendment in S. 3521 prohibiting the President from resubmitting certain items. The manager's amendment in S. 3521 made changes to Title I, including the legislative line item veto. The bill would prevent the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allow resubmission of cancellations if Congress fails to act due to adjournment. The amendment also proposes to shorten the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits if a cancellation proposal is submitted after the effective date. The amendment in S. 3521 aims to reduce the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits if a cancellation proposal is submitted after the effective date. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on final passage within 10 days of introduction. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress aim to ensure a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days after its introduction in the chamber. The scope of coverage of expedited rescission bills has varied over the years, with some bills containing provisions for alternative packages or motions to strike specific rescissions. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have differed in scope, with some including discretionary budget authority and later adding direct spending and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 would expand possible cancellations to include certain transportation projects. The LLIVA in all versions considered grants the President authority in rescissions. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4699 would add transportation projects to possible cancellations available to the President. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional flaws and provisions for judicial review. The LLIVA grants the President broad authority for rescissions. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional flaws and provisions for judicial review, while the expedited rescission approach for discretionary spending is seen as constitutional. The LLIVA includes a severability provision for statutory insulation. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 includes a provision for statutory insulation, ensuring that if one provision is found unconstitutional, the rest of the act remains unaffected. This allows the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration. The Bush Administration is still involved in seeking enactment of a version of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress. The Bush Administration is actively seeking the enactment of a line item veto legislation in the 109th Congress to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline. The President is pushing for a line item veto to target pork in large spending bills and improve fiscal discipline."
