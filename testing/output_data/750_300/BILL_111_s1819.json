    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Civil Rights Center and Museum Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress acknowledges the significance of the Greensboro sit-in in 1960, which sparked nonviolent protests against segregation across the US. Over 70,000 people participated in similar demonstrations by 1961 in over 60 cities. This led to the establishment of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, located at the site of the F.W. Woolworth's store where the sit-in movement began in 1960, will serve as an archival center and teaching facility exploring the international struggle for civil and human rights. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, opening on February 1, 2010, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the sit-in movement, preserving the legacy of the civil rights struggle for future generations. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue up to 1,000 $1 silver coins commemorating the opening of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum.
