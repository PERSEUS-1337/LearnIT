    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising health insurance enrollment and an aging population. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for healthcare provision are often overlooked in budget discussions, alongside the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Congressional focus on health-related tax expenditures is important. Tax subsidies for healthcare provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, in the form of tax expenditures, result in revenue foregone. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, and comparison to total revenue collected. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to determine the increase in tax expenditures since the enactment of the ACA and how they compare to total revenue collected. It also examines the size of health tax expenditures relative to discretionary and mandatory outlays on health programs in past years, as well as the growth of federal support for health through direct outlays versus revenue losses from tax expenditures. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) at the budget function level. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001. The report CP10001 provides background material on individual tax expenditures, using the methodology of the Joint Committee on Taxation. It defines tax expenditures as revenue losses attributable to specific provisions. For a broader analysis and comparison of tax expenditures by budget function, refer to CRS Report R44012. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws. JCT uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income to identify provisions causing a deviation from measured income. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws. These provisions cause a divergence from measured income under a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition. JCT publishes estimates of tax expenditures during each session of Congress, categorizing them in various ways. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws, which are included in JCT's estimates during each session of Congress. These provisions are categorized by budget function, such as health, commerce, housing, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. The Department of the Treasury has its own list of tax expenditures categorized by budget function. The health budget function used by JCT for tax expenditures is broader than that used by agencies like OMB for outlays, due to historical practices and the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions. The difference in historical practices between JCT and OMB, along with the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions, contributes to the broader health budget function used by JCT for tax expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes tax expenditures based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) categorizes tax expenditures by forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act: exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, which can inform Congressional decision-making on policies' economic impacts. Tax expenditures are evaluated based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity to inform Congressional decision-making. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies but create others. Exclusions and deductions in tax expenditures may undermine tax progressivity. Administrative considerations also play a role in evaluating tax expenditures. Tax expenditures in the form of exclusions and deductions could undermine tax progressivity by benefiting filers based on their top marginal income tax rate. Administering social policy through the tax code may be advantageous for targeting lower-income households, but it could also increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. Administering tax expenditures as direct spending or grant programs may be easier in some cases. Administering social programs through the tax code could increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. Administering tax expenditures as direct spending or grant programs may be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, excluding Medicare-related provisions as of December 2015. References to \"health-related\" tax provisions include both health and Medicare tax expenditures before FY2015. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, excluding Medicare-related provisions. The largest tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which is also the largest in the federal tax code. JCT no longer includes Medicare-related provisions in its tax expenditure estimates. The largest health tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which is also the largest in the federal tax code. From FY2015 to FY2019, the annual tax expenditure amount for ESI will increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with the annual tax expenditure amount for APTCs increasing from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion. The tax expenditure for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges (APTCs) is estimated to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. These health-related tax expenditures serve various purposes and have a long history in the tax code, subsidizing private health insurance costs and reducing the cost of private activities with positive societal benefits. Some health tax provisions in the code have origins in legal doctrine or thought about income definitions at the time of adoption, indirectly affected by other policies. Some older health tax provisions in the code have origins in legal doctrine or income definitions at the time of adoption, indirectly affected by other policies. For example, the ESI tax exclusion can be traced back to 1918. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, saw significant expansion during and after World War II due to administrative decisions and policies that froze wages. Regulatory rulings in 1954 had conflicting outcomes on the tax treatment of employer health contributions. The ESI tax exclusion was significantly expanded during and after World War II by freezing wages but not employer-sponsored fringe benefits. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 explicitly excluded employer health contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 are analyzed in this section. The analysis covers JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019, showing changes in the number of provisions over time. Three Medicare-related tax provisions were separately analyzed through FY2014, as they were no longer classified as tax expenditures from FY2015 onwards. Multiple tax expenditure provisions are combined to track changes in tax expenditures. For this report, tax expenditure provisions are analyzed together to show changes over time in this budget function. JCT does not typically combine multiple tax expenditure values due to potential interactions between provisions. Provisions with minimal tax expenditure value are excluded from calculations. The value of tax expenditures estimated as a group is not the same as the sum of individual tax expenditure estimates. Health-related tax expenditures have increased over time, with a 43.0% increase from FY2004 to FY2014 in real terms. From FY2004 to FY2014, health-related tax expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with fluctuations above and below historical averages. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics, health care costs, and policy changes affecting the cost of health-related tax expenditures. The annual value of health tax expenditures is projected to rise from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019 due to factors like demographic shifts, increasing healthcare costs, and policy changes impacting health-related tax expenses. Medicare-related tax expenditures were previously calculated based on benefits exceeding insurance payments, excluding all Medicare benefits from income tax. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time, with JCT measuring a positive tax expenditure if insurance benefits exceeded payments for Medicare Part A, B, or D. Before FY1987, tax expenditures for Medicare were minimal, indicating that insurance benefits were roughly equal to payments. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with JCT estimating a 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) annual increase from FY1987 to FY2014. This suggests that the value of Medicare insurance benefits to beneficiaries grew at a faster rate than payments during this period. The annual value of Medicare insurance to beneficiaries increased at rates higher than payments over time, with Medicare-related tax expenditures estimated to be 26.8% of health tax expenditures in FY2014. Health tax expenditures have also increased from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014, growing faster than total revenue collections. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014, growing faster than total revenue collections. In FY2015, health tax expenditures are estimated to increase to 7.7% of total revenue collected. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014, growing faster than total revenue collections. In FY2015, health tax expenditures are estimated to increase to 7.7% of total revenue collected. Tax expenditure values alone do not provide a complete picture of tax policies in health fields relative to total revenue. Several taxes imposed by the ACA raise revenue, such as the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, the individual mandate, the employer mandate, and the medical device tax. Additionally, the ACA imposed a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax on higher-income taxpayers. The annual revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total value of health tax expenditures. Figure 3 displays discretionary and mandatory outlays, as organized under OMB's health budget function, and health-related tax. The annual revenue raised by the ACA provisions, including the 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax on higher-income taxpayers, is small compared to total health tax expenditures. Figure 3 shows discretionary and mandatory outlays under OMB's health budget function and health-related tax expenditures as a share of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The OMB classifies a narrower set of activities under its health budget function compared to JCT's categories for tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. The comparison between federal outlays and tax expenditures can help track support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, while administrative costs are funded through discretionary spending. Federal health research and veterans' health care are primarily funded through discretionary spending. The values of health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health increased from 1.0% of GDP in FY1974 to 5.0% of GDP in FY2014. Mandatory health outlays as a percentage of GDP have increased significantly over the years, from 1.0% in FY1974 to 5.0% in FY2014. Health-related tax expenditures have also grown, from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained relatively stable between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. Health tax expenditures have varied between 0.3% and 1.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Medicare-related tax expenditure provisions were no longer classified starting FY2015. Some health tax expenditures are long-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, with historical rationales potentially differing from current policy effects. Some provisions in the Internal Revenue Code have long-standing historical origins, potentially different from current policy effects. These provisions may have stemmed from past legal definitions or administrative rulings.
