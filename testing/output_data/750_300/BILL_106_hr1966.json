    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Asthma Awareness, Education and Treatment Act of 1999\". Asthma affects 14.6 million Americans, including 4.8 million children. Allergies, including allergic asthma, impact 40-50 million Americans. Asthma is common in children, causing 25% of school absenteeism and is the third leading cause of preventable hospitalizations. Pediatric asthma prevalence increased by 72% from 1980 to 1994. During 1980-1994, pediatric asthma prevalence rose by 72%, with preschool children seeing a 160% increase. Asthma is more prevalent in women than men, and low-income families have a higher prevalence. In low-income families, asthma prevalence is higher. For families earning less than $10,000 annually, 79.2 out of 1,000 individuals under 45 have asthma, compared to 53.6 out of 1,000 for those earning $20,000 to $35,000. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks. African Americans had an average of 38.5 deaths per million individuals from asthma during 1993-1995, while Caucasians had 15.1 deaths per million. The average number of deaths from asthma for African Americans was 38.5 per million individuals from 1993 to 1995, compared to 15.1 deaths per million for Caucasians. Asthma costs the US over $12 billion annually, with rising prevalence leading to higher future costs. African Americans are five times more likely to seek care for asthma at an emergency room. The asthma death rate is four times higher among African American children and two times higher among all. Exercise can improve the physical and psychological well-being of children, including self-esteem, and help manage asthma. It can also establish lifelong habits of physical activity, enhancing quality and length of life. SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR PROJECTS FOR ASTHMA-RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES.
