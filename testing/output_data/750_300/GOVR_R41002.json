    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are at the center of a conflict involving Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage to M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, altering the benefits produced by a dam. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a significant role. Congress recognized state primacy in developing M&I supplies in the Water Supply Act of 1958. Reallocation requests for shifting storage to M&I use are expected at Corps facilities in various states. The Water Supply Act of 1958 recognized state primacy in developing water supplies for various purposes, emphasizing federal cooperation with states and local interests in water resource projects. The federal government has primarily invested in water resources infrastructure to support flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities. The largest projects were constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Since the 1960s, construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Recent reservoir planning focuses on balancing objectives in operating existing reservoirs. Construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on balancing objectives in operating existing reservoirs, with Congress authorizing the Corps for construction projects. Each dam and reservoir are operated to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. The Corps operates dams and reservoirs to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has also included additional requirements for all Corps facilities, such as fish and wildlife protection. The Corps operates dams and reservoirs for authorized purposes, with 91 reservoirs having M&I storage. Congress has additional requirements for all facilities, including fish and wildlife protection. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply, allowing surplus water for temporary M&I use. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply, allowing surplus water for temporary M&I use. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with storage reallocated under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with storage reallocated under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority. Congress provided the Corps with M&I water supply authority in the 1958 WSA, limiting the agency's decision-making without congressional approval. The Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 390b) granted the Corps M&I water supply authority, but limited decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply require Congress approval. The Water Supply Act of 1958 granted the Corps M&I water supply authority, but major changes require congressional approval. The Corps developed guidance for implementing this authority in 1977. The Corps developed guidance in 1977 for determining when a reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for water supply purposes does not require congressional approval. The Corps developed guidance in 1977 for determining when a reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for water supply purposes does not require congressional approval. Reallocation of storage serving authorized purposes to domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes is considered insignificant if the total reallocation is not greater than 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet, whichever is less. The Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir storage reallocations have come under scrutiny following a federal court decision regarding operations at Lake Lanier. Lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated in 2007, with a court order in 2009 addressing whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes in operations to provide water supply. In 2007, lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated, leading to a court order in 2009 that found the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval. The court sided with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers, who argued that the Corps' actions harmed authorized purposes. The court found that the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without seeking congressional approval. This reallocation represented roughly 260,000 acre-feet and started in the mid-1970s with operational changes shifting storage from hydropower to M&I supply. The court determined that the Corps exceeded its discretionary authority to reallocate by contracting with M&I water providers for storage space for withdrawals directly from the lake. The court found that the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating storage from hydropower to M&I supply at Lake Lanier. This exceeded its authority, raising questions about water reallocation at other Corps reservoirs with M&I storage designated. The Corps has 135 reservoirs with 11 million acre-feet of storage for M&I water, with 44 reservoirs authorized under the 1958 WSA for M&I storage. Lake Texoma has had over 50,000 AF reallocated for M&I use through four reallocations. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with four reallocations totaling 103,003 AF. One reallocation for 84,099 AF was approved in 1985 with compensation for lost hydropower. Other reallocations at Lake Texoma required specific congressional approval. The Corps approved a compensation arrangement for lost hydropower at Lake Texoma, allowing for a transfer of water without significant harm to the lake's purposes. The transfer exceeded the agency's policy limit but was deemed permissible under the 1958 WSA. The Corps exceeded the agency's policy limit for reallocations without congressional approval, except at Cowanesque Lake where reallocated water supply exceeded 15% of storage. The Cowanesque Lake case involved a mix of project-specific reallocation direction from Congress and the Corps' discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. The Cowanesque reallocation under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority was mentioned in P.L. 99-88, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1985. The Corps evaluates potential effects before recommending a reallocation, considering impacts on authorized purposes and operational changes. Studies supporting reallocations should assess how M&I reallocation may impact authorized purposes. The Corps evaluates potential effects before recommending a reallocation, considering impacts on authorized purposes and operational changes. Concerns raised by a 2009 court order question the sufficiency of studies supporting reallocations, particularly regarding how an M&I reallocation may affect authorized purposes or constitute a major operational change. The evaluation of Corps reallocation analyses is not covered in this CRS report. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in Table 1 due to exceeding the 1958 WSA authority. The CRS report does not cover the evaluation of Corps reallocation analyses. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in Table 1 due to exceeding the 1958 WSA authority. Unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities are largely unknown. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns raised about unauthorized withdrawals and reallocations at other Corps facilities. Many Corps dams are old and their operations have evolved over time, leading to uncertainty about future reallocations. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial due to concerns about unauthorized withdrawals and reallocations at other Corps facilities. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention, but there is uncertainty about future reallocations and how they will be evaluated and performed. Congress may need to address the Corps' interpretation and use of its discretionary authority. The Corps' reallocations under the 1958 WSA have generally met the numeric criteria set for their discretionary authority. Congress may need to address issues such as multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and financial arrangements. The Corps' reallocations under the 1958 WSA have generally met numeric criteria. Congress may need to address issues like multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, financial arrangements, and handling ongoing unauthorized withdrawals. The Corps' reallocations under the 1958 WSA have generally met numeric criteria. Congress may need to address issues like multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, financial arrangements, and handling ongoing unauthorized withdrawals. Questions arise regarding reallocations to M&I, including transition processes, charging for storage space, crediting return flows, and broader water policy considerations for Congress. This includes determining the federal role in municipal water supply and potential adjustments due to climate change impacts on existing water supplies. The appropriate federal role in municipal water supply and potential adjustments due to climate change impacts on existing water supplies are complex issues for Congress to address. The wide range of opinions and challenges in enacting changes to federal facilities operations add to the complexity of these water policy questions. Addressing questions about the national interest and current challenges regarding federal facilities operations is complex due to differing opinions and difficulties in implementing changes."
