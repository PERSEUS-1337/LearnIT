    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States for agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders under nonimmigrant status for an initial period of 3 years. Aliens admitted as nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) for employment as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders can be admitted for an initial 3-year period, with the possibility of extending for an additional 3 years. Employers petitioning to employ H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from temporary or seasonal requirements. Employers filing petitions for H-2A workers as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders are exempt from showing that the positions are temporary or seasonal. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status in these roles may adjust to lawful permanent resident status. An eligible alien with H-2A worker status as a dairy worker, sheepherder, or goat herder can seek an immigrant visa under specific conditions. An eligible alien with H-2A worker status can seek an immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii) without the need for a labor certification. The classification petition can be filed by the alien's employer or the eligible alien themselves. An eligible alien under H-2A worker status can apply for an immigrant visa without needing a labor certification. Filing a petition or adjustment of status based on the petition will not affect other H-2A worker petitions. Adjustment of status based on an H-2A worker petition will not impact other H-2A worker petitions, extensions of nonimmigrant status, admissions, visa requests, or requests to modify immigration status. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved H-2A worker petition in 1-year increments until a final decision is made. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. This does not prevent the alien from seeking adjustment of status through other provisions of law.
