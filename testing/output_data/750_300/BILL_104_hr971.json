The Congress recognizes the importance of homeowners in preserving property value, which is influenced by the neighborhood and environment. The value of a home is linked to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including water, air, flooding risk, scenic beauty, odors, noise, wildlife, and other factors in the United States. The value of homes in the United States can be negatively impacted by various factors such as offensive odors, excessive noise, industrial activities, and irresponsible actions of entities or individuals.

If a homeowner's property is likely to lose value, the agency will investigate and look for ways to minimize the impact. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. Whenever a person carries out an activity authorized by a permit, license, or other approval that generates pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of private homes, the homeowner can take legal action against them.

The agency head can convene a meeting to resolve the claim and avoid litigation costs, but the homeowner retains the right to take legal action after the 30-day notice period. In any legal action for property value reduction, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's actions caused the decrease. Homeowners with similar issues can file class action suits in federal court.
