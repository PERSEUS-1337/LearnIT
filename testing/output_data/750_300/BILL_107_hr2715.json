The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands per population. This deficiency will worsen with continued growth unless action is taken soon. The lack of park, recreation, natural open space, and habitat protection in the greater Southern California metropolitan region deprives residents of health benefits, reduced crime, lower social tension, and increased educational opportunities associated with nature proximity. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys offers significant scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and economic benefits to Southern California. These assets deserve increased protection to provide urban populations with nature proximity benefits like reduced crime and increased educational opportunities. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, encompassing various mountain ranges and connector areas, contains significant examples of scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and economic assets deserving increased protection for public benefit in the 21st century and beyond. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills, and adjacent connector areas, showcases the endangered Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem and unique ecotones. The escarpment of the San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest is a key feature of this area. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including various mountain ranges, features the San Gabriel Mountains escarpment within the Angeles National Forest, primarily managed for watershed, recreation, and habitat values. Privately owned lands in the corridor provide additional scenic, environmental, and recreational benefits and should be protected through voluntary incentives. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, with its diverse mountain ranges and the San Gabriel Mountains escarpment, holds significant scenic, environmental, and recreational value. Efforts to protect these lands through voluntary incentives have been hindered by a lack of financial resources and technical assistance. The State of California and local governments have made progress in preserving the unique natural and recreational resources in the area. Valley Corridor has made progress in protecting natural and recreational resources but lacks financial resources, technical assistance, and expertise from the Federal Government. Study of Rim of the Valley Corridor for potential inclusion in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will use specific criteria and involve consultation with relevant advisory committees. Establishment of an advisory committee is outlined in Section 4. Establishment of the Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee to advise on boundaries for an expanded recreation area. The Committee will recommend boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area, reflecting the existing Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area boundaries and including the lands of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Committee will recommend boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area, including lands, waters, and interests as depicted on maps on file with the Secretary of the State of California. The recommendation must be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior within 365 days after the first Committee meeting. The Committee will recommend boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area, including maps depicting proposed boundaries. Public participation in the recommendation process is required. The Committee consists of 24 appointed members. The Committee consists of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, with opportunities for public participation in recommending boundaries for the Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area. The Committee consists of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, with one nominee each from various local government bodies in the Los Angeles area. The Committee consists of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, with nominees from city councils of Westlake Village, Malibu, Calabasas, Burbank, Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, and Santa Clarita. The city councils of Pasadena, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, Santa Clarita, Moorpark, and the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county represent the unincorporated communities within the jurisdiction of the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor, in consultation with the Town Council of Altadena and the Crescenta Valley Town Council. The unincorporated communities within the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor are represented by various authorities, including the Superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the Supervisor of the Angeles National Forest, and the Superintendent of the Angeles District of the State of California Department of Parks and Recreation. The stakeholders involved in the management of the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor include the Supervisor of the Angeles National Forest, the Superintendent of the Angeles District of the State of California Department of Parks and Recreation, the Director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a representative of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, and a representative of the Conejo Recreation and Park District. The Committee overseeing the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor includes representatives from Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Conejo Recreation and Park District, and Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. The Committee will select a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members, who will serve without compensation but will be reimbursed for expenses by the Secretary. The Committee overseeing the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor will select a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members.
