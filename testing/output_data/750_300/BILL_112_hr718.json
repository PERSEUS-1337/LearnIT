Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in approximately 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. There is currently no effective treatment to halt or slow the disease's progression, with clinical indicators including loss of movement control and cognitive impairment.

Huntington's Disease can manifest in adults between 30 and 50 years of age, with late-onset cases occurring after 50 years and juvenile cases affecting individuals under 19 years old, progressing more rapidly. Due to the incapacitating nature of the disease, individuals with Huntington's Disease are unable to work and often rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite medical advancements, the disease still poses challenges for affected individuals. The Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, specifically for Huntington's Disease.

The Act will amend the Listing of Impairments to provide medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease in adults and children, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease. Amendments will be made to the Listing of Impairments to include medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile Huntington's Disease.
