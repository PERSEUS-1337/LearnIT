The House had also passed a consolidated bill (H.R. 3354) that included agriculture. The final appropriation was facilitated by new, higher budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1625) included Agriculture appropriations from both House and Senate Committees. The final appropriation was facilitated by higher budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123).

The bill focuses on discretionary spending and is detailed in Figure 2. The bill focuses on discretionary spending for the Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. Mandatory spending is also included in the bill. In the annual budget resolution process, discretionary appropriations set spending limits for agency operations and grant programs. Mandatory spending, controlled by budget rules, is set in laws like the 2014 farm bill and 2010 child nutrition reauthorizations. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, while mandatory spending comprised 84%. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total, with mandatory spending making up the remaining 84%. The majority of the mandatory spending was attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The largest discretionary spending items included the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid and trade, and farm programs. The largest discretionary spending items in Agriculture appropriations are for programs like WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. Mandatory spending includes SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes spending items such as SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" that requires annual funding, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. Annual appropriations reimburse the Treasury for using the CCC's line of credit. The CCC operates on a line of credit, with annual appropriations reimbursing the Treasury. Changes in Agriculture appropriations have generally mirrored changes in the bill's total discretionary limit. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have since increased. Historical comparisons may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title has increased since FY2008. The total budget authority in Titles I-VI was higher than the official discretionary spending allocation due to negative amounts in Title VII and other adjustments. Rescissions and limits on mandatory programs contributed to the net negative general provisions. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed a 21% reduction in funding for USDA, including the elimination of some programs. The budget outline was released in March 2017, later than usual, with intentions primarily at the Cabinet level.

Congress emphasized its authority in determining final funding levels for FY2018, cautioning USDA and FDA against preemptively redirecting staffing based on uncertain outcomes. USDA and FDA released their budget justifications, with some discrepancies from OMB proposals. CFTC, as an independent agency, requested a different budget amount than the Administration. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations in FY2018, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. The congressional appropriations committees evaluated the Trump Administration's request for Agriculture appropriations in FY2018. The House Appropriations Committee incrementally made \"302(b)\" allocations to its subcommittees to facilitate markups beginning in June 2017, with the Agriculture Subcommittee receiving nearly $20 billion of discretionary budget authority. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed and reported it on July 12, 2017.

The $20 billion discretionary total in the House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017. This reduction would primarily come from cuts to rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, and department administration. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill aimed to reduce funding compared to FY2017, with cuts to rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research.

It reduced rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million, while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it made $220 million more in reductions compared to the House-passed bill through rescissions and changing mandatory programs. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading Congress to pass CRs to fund the government. The first Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. The first CR for FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation, including a 0.6791% across-the-board reduction and increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The CR for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program provides about $238 million, slightly higher than the FY2017 funding level of $236 million. A technical correction is made for the computation of rescission to Section 32 funds, allowing for carryover funds, especially for disaster payments. Two subsequent CRs extended the provisions and anomalies of the first CR. The CR extended provisions and anomalies to December 22, 2017, then to January 19, 2018, waiving PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A three-day government shutdown occurred until a fourth CR extended the CR to February 8, 2018. The government experienced multiple shutdowns due to the absence of further continuing resolutions or appropriations, with the last one occurring in February 2018. This led to the extension of the CR to March 23, 2018, as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the continuing resolution to March 23, 2018, raised budget caps for discretionary spending, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, amended farm bill provisions, and revised agriculture programs.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $165 million for rural water and wastewater recovery, $89 million for disasters in other USDA accounts, and $1.4 billion for the successor to the farm bill, including funding for dairy programs, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton. The cotton addition involved adding seed cotton to farm commodity programs, offset by reductions in base acres and crop insurance. These changes were also included in the Senate appropriations markup, Section 728 of S. 1603. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated funds for rural water and wastewater recovery, disaster relief, and farm bill successor programs. This included adding seed cotton to farm commodity programs, offset by reductions in base acres and crop insurance.

Budget Sequestration is a process of automatic, across-the-board reductions that cancel budget authority. Budget Sequestration is a process of automatic, across-the-board reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory budget goals. Sequestration is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2027. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps set by the BCA, allowing for larger appropriations and avoiding sequestration on discretionary spending. Sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised discretionary budget caps, allowing for larger appropriations and avoiding sequestration on discretionary spending. Sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts, despite the budget acts. Congress extended mandatory sequestration multiple times as offsets in budget acts, pushing the duration until FY2027 for nonexempt mandatory accounts. Congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027 as an offset in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. OMB may exempt certain prior legal obligations in crop insurance and farm commodity programs. OMB may exempt legal obligations in crop insurance and farm commodity programs from sequestration. While crop insurance is mostly exempt, farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. For example, under the 2014 farm bill, farm commodity program payments were reduced by 6.8% in FY2016. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction in agriculture accounts. In FY2018, nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts faced a 6.6% sequestration rate, resulting in a reduction of about $1.3 billion from authorized funds.
