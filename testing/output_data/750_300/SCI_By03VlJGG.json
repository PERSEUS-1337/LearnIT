Existing approaches focus on simple link structures between entities, but our approach proposes a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders to incorporate various data types like text, images, and numerical values. We extend existing datasets to create benchmarks with additional relations such as textual descriptions and images. Our model utilizes additional information effectively to improve accuracy in learning embeddings of entities. We create new benchmarks with extra relations like textual descriptions and images. Knowledge bases are crucial in various computational systems, but they often face challenges. Knowledge bases (KB) are vital for computational systems in various domains, but they often suffer from incompleteness and noise. Learning relational knowledge representation has been a focus of active research to address these deficiencies by estimating fixed, low-dimensional representations for entities and relations. Relational triples in knowledge bases are being actively researched to address incompleteness and noise. These triples consist of subject entity, relation, and object entity representations to encode uncertainty and infer missing facts efficiently. Knowledge bases contain various data types beyond fixed entities, including numerical and textual attributes. Knowledge bases contain various data types beyond fixed entities, including numerical attributes, textual attributes, and images. These different types of relations provide crucial evidence for knowledge base completion, such as textual descriptions and images supporting a person's age, profession, and designation. Relational modeling is essential for knowledge base completion as textual descriptions and images can provide evidence for attributes like age, profession, and designation. This additional information, like conventional link data, may be missing or noisy, requiring prediction to address queries. A comprehensive approach is needed to incorporate all observed information and represent uncertainty in multimodal relational evidence beyond just the graph view. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases, incorporating various data types like textual, images, numerical, and categorical values. The approach extends the DistMult method by learning vectors for entities and relations.

The paper introduces a multimodal embedding approach for knowledge base modeling, incorporating textual and image data using CNN and LSTM encoders. The scoring module remains unchanged, producing a score indicating the probability of a triple being correct. This unified model allows for information flow across different relation types, improving relational data modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on two relational databases with new benchmarks created from existing datasets.

The model extends to a multimodal setting, incorporating various types of information about entities in knowledge bases. Relational modeling involves training a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets of subject, relation, and object. The link prediction problem aims to learn a scoring function for entities and relations in a knowledge base using observed facts, which may be incomplete or noisy. Successful methods in recent years involve models that learn fixed-length vectors, matrices, or tensors for each entity and relation. The KB contains observed facts in the form of triples, which may be incomplete or noisy. Recent successful methods involve models that learn representations for entities and relations. The proposed framework can work with various relational models, but focuses on the DistMult approach for its simplicity, popularity, and accuracy. In DistMult, entities are mapped to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices. The proposed framework focuses on the DistMult approach for learning representations of entities and relations in a knowledge base. DistMult maps entities to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices, computing scores for triples using a pairwise ranking loss to differentiate between existing and non-existing triples. DistMult uses a pairwise ranking loss to score existing triples higher than non-existing triples. Negative samples are generated by replacing entities in training triplets. DistMult learns entity and relation representations for knowledge base tasks like completion and queries.
