    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The key difference for IC whistleblowers is the need to protect classified information. The IC recognizes whistleblowing as a way to save money, promote ethics, and ensure a safe work environment. Protections for IC employees and contractors only apply to lawful disclosures that follow reporting procedures to protect classified information. Leaking to the media or foreign entities is not covered. Whistleblower protections in the IC only apply to lawful disclosures following reporting procedures to protect classified information. They do not cover leaking to the media or foreign governments, and do not protect against differences of opinion unless there are concerns over legality or constitutionality. Legitimate adverse personnel or security clearance decisions are not covered if the agency can prove they would have taken the same action regardless. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures following reporting procedures to protect classified information. They do not cover leaking to the media or foreign governments, and do not protect against differences of opinion unless there are concerns over legality or constitutionality. Legitimate adverse personnel or security clearance decisions are not covered if the agency can prove they would have taken the same action regardless. Congress and the executive branch have defined procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures, with specific guidance available for IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and others. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections address the security of classified information and provide guidance for whistleblowers, including IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and federal employees. There are concerns about the transparency of internal processes and the adequacy of protections for IC contractors. Protections have evolved to address perceived gaps in safeguarding whistleblowers against reprisal. The first whistleblower legislation specific to the IC was the Intelligence Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures following reporting procedures to protect classified information. They do not cover leaking to the media or foreign governments, and do not protect against differences of opinion unless there are concerns over legality or constitutionality. Legitimate adverse personnel or security clearance decisions are not covered if the agency can prove they would have taken the same action regardless. Congress and the executive branch have defined procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures, with specific guidance available for IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and others. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved to address gaps in safeguarding whistleblowers against reprisal. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 established a process for IC whistleblowers to make complaints but offered no specific protections. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 included general provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, signed in 2012, provided the first specific protections. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved with the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 codifying specific protections in response to vulnerabilities perceived in IC whistleblowers. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 and Intelligence Community Directive (ICD)-120 established implementation policies for whistleblower protections. 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 provides whistleblower protections for members of the Armed Forces within the IC. In response to perceived vulnerabilities in Intelligence Community whistleblowers, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 codified protections. 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 provides whistleblower protections for Armed Forces members within the IC. Congress passed P.L. 115-118 in January 2018, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was intended to assist whistleblowers. Section 110 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 amended the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was created to assist IC whistleblowers, excluding members of the Armed Forces assigned to an IC element. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was amended to allow IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. This provision was added to address gaps in protections for IC contractors and ensure the flow of information needed by intelligence committees for oversight responsibilities. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to protect classified information. The IG must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head, who then reports to congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. Employees can directly submit complaints to Congress if the IG fails to report accurately. The ICWPA requires the IG to report complaints to congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. If the IG fails to do so accurately, employees can directly submit complaints to Congress after notifying the IG and obtaining procedures for protecting classified information. However, the ICWPA does not provide specific protections for whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The ICWPA allows IC whistleblowers to securely report complaints to Congress via the relevant IC agency IG, but lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection, establishing the OIGIC and permitting lawful disclosures to the IGIC. The IAA for FY2010 established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC) and allowed lawful disclosures to the IGIC for investigating complaints of violations within the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence. The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health and safety within the Director of National Intelligence's responsibilities. The Inspector General must protect the identity of the employee unless unavoidable during the investigation. The Inspector General must protect the identity of the employee unless disclosure is unavoidable during the investigation or made to a Department of Justice official. No reprisal can be taken against the employee for making a complaint or disclosing information. The Inspector General must protect the identity of the employee unless disclosure is unavoidable during the investigation or made to a Department of Justice official. No reprisal can be taken against the employee for making a complaint or disclosing information. Section 405 covers contractors and federal employees of IC elements, allowing the Inspector General access to any employee or contractor necessary for their duties. The Inspector General of the IC has access to employees or contractors of any intelligence community element for duty performance. Employees can report complaints or urgent concerns to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal. The Inspector General of the IC can receive complaints or urgent concerns from employees or contractors without fear of reprisal. Protections against reprisals for lawful disclosures were clarified by Section 425(d) of the IAA for FY2010 and PPD-19 signed by President Obama in 2012. PPD-19, implemented on October 10, 2012, offers protections for IC whistleblowers who make lawful disclosures to specified authorities within their chain of command or agency. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers who report violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety to designated officials in their chain of command or agency. It prohibits reprisals that could impact access to classified information or involve personnel actions. PPD-19 prohibits reprisals against IC whistleblowers for making protected disclosures, including actions that could affect access to classified information or involve personnel actions. IC elements must certify a process for employees to seek review of reprisal actions, ensuring the security of classified information. The IC element Inspector General determines if reprisals occurred. The review process under PPD-19 ensures protection for IC whistleblowers against reprisals, including personnel actions. The IC element Inspector General determines if reprisals occurred and makes recommendations for corrective action, which the agency head must consider. IC agencies also certify to the DNI that they have a review process in place. The agency head must carefully consider the Inspector General's findings and recommendations regarding violations. IC agencies must certify to the DNI that they have a review process for employees to appeal actions involving access to classified information. Whistleblowers can request an external review by an IG panel if they have exhausted the agency review process. If the panel rules in favor of the employee, the agency must take action. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if agency review process is exhausted. Panel decisions must be considered by the agency, but not necessarily accepted. IGIC reports annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Training on classified information access is required for executive branch employees. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against retaliation for lawful disclosures. This includes protection from personnel actions made in reprisal for protected disclosures. Section 601 of Title VI protects IC whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities, including the Director of National Intelligence, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, congressional intelligence committees, and employing agency officials. Section 601 of Title VI protects IC whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities, including the Director of National Intelligence, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, congressional intelligence committees, and employing agency officials. The legislation defines a lawful disclosure as a violation of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. However, there is no specific mention of protections for contractors in this section. Section 602 of Title VI protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It also requires the development of appeal policies for decisions affecting a whistleblower's security clearance. This provision allows the whistleblower to retain their employment status pending the appeal outcome. Section 602 of Title VI protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It allows the whistleblower to retain their employment status pending the appeal outcome. ICD-120 provides implementing guidance for PPD-19, including protections against reprisal involving a personnel action. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, signed in 2014 and updated in 2016, provides guidance for PPD-19. It includes protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, covers contractors and members of the Armed Forces, and allows appeals for security clearance decisions. The provision in ICD-120 includes protections for IC whistleblowers, contractors, and members of the Armed Forces, allowing appeals for security clearance decisions and maintaining employment status during pending decisions. It also mandates an IC-wide review process for reprisal claims and requires communications and training on whistleblower protections. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides additional protections. Provision for an employee alleging reprisal to request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC after exhausting internal agency review process. IC-wide communications and training on whistleblower protections mandated. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections against retaliation for protected communications by Armed Forces members in the IC. Unlike the ICWPA, Section 1034 does not include a process for making protected communications that also protect classified information. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code allows Armed Forces members in the IC to make protected communications with various entities without a process for protecting classified information. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of Armed Forces members who make protected communications with various entities, including law enforcement organizations, courts-martial proceedings, and Inspector Generals. It also outlines prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for making a protected communication and enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for members facing reprisals. The curr_chunk outlines measures to protect Armed Forces members who make protected communications, including enabling the DOD to mitigate hardship for members facing reprisals and requiring periodic updates during investigations. It also mandates uniform standards for investigations of prohibited personnel actions and training for Inspectors General staff. The curr_chunk discusses the inconsistency in coverage of contractors in existing IC whistleblower protection legislation, with efforts in Congress to address the gap culminating in the passage of P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018. The passage discusses efforts in Congress to address gaps in whistleblower protection for IC contractors, leading to the passage of P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017, to protect IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. The bill included provisions for a complaint process. Additionally, on March 18, 2015, she introduced S. 794 to extend protections for contractor employees on a contract. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 on March 18, 2015, to extend protections for contractor employees on a contract with an IC element who make whistleblower complaints. The bill aimed to protect classified information in court actions. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018, amending the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide further protections. On January 19, 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers. This amendment allows IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to the head of the contracting agency, appropriate inspector general, DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. The amendment to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act (P.L. 115-118) provides protections for IC contractor whistleblowers, allowing them to make lawful disclosures to relevant authorities. Section 110 of the amendment offers clear safeguards for IC contractors reporting retaliatory personnel actions. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including various forms of misconduct such as violations of federal laws or gross mismanagement. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act extends protections to FBI contractors, including those in the Intelligence Branch, who report violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, or other forms of misconduct. These protections are similar to those provided to IC employees and contractors under Title 50, U.S. Code. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act extends protections to FBI contractors in the Intelligence Branch who report violations of federal laws or misconduct. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC to support hiring investigators and support. The House passed a measure on June 18, 2014, redirecting $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC. The funds were allocated to hire investigators and support staff to enhance the IGIC's ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse, addressing a previously underfunded capability."
