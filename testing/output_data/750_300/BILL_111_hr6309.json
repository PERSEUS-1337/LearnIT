Definitions are provided in Section 2. The \"NOTICE Act of 2010\" defines key terms such as business entity, commerce, and consumer within the context of conducting commerce in the United States. The term \"consumer\" is defined as any individual in the United States who purchases goods or services for personal use. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to customer service communication, telecommunication, and wire communication. These terms are crucial for understanding interactions between consumers and businesses. The curr_chunk defines wire communication as the transmission of various forms of information through wire, cable, or similar connections. This is essential for understanding communication methods in customer service and telecommunication. The curr_chunk requires business entities engaged in customer service communications to disclose their physical location. Business entities must disclose their physical location in customer service communications, except if all employees are in the United States. The requirements for disclosing physical location in customer service communications do not apply if all employees involved are located in the United States. Additionally, if a consumer initiates the communication with a foreign entity, the disclosure requirements do not apply to the business entity's employees or agents. The disclosure requirements for physical location in customer service communications do not apply if the communication is initiated by the consumer and the employee or agent is located outside the United States. The Federal Trade Commission may exclude certain business entities or customer service communications from disclosure requirements if located outside the United States or related to emergency services.
