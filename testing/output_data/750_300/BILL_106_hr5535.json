    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection. Additionally, it includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. SEC. 3 of the Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose artificial reef and aquatic habitat restoration projects as a supplemental environmental program instead of paying fines. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO PUBLICLY OWNED SHORES. (a) Eligibility of Shoreline Protection Projects.--Subsection (d) of the Act authorizing Federal participation in protecting publicly owned shores is amended to consider shores with insufficient public access as privately owned. (b) Cost Sharing.--Section 103(d) of the Water Resources Development Act is amended to include additional provisions. The Secretary will issue rules to define privately owned shores as including publicly owned shores with insufficient public access. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore with assistance provided by the Secretary, allowing exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for beach nourishment without needing further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for beach nourishment without requiring further appropriation. The funds are available for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA, and for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects by the Secretary of the Army. The Beach Nourishment Account receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to use the funds for these projects in accordance with cost-sharing requirements. The Beach Nourishment Account is used for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army must report transactions to Congress and invest any excess funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to invest excess funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States for the Beach Nourishment Account. Investments can be made on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price. The Beach Nourishment Account allows the Secretary of the Treasury to invest excess funds in US obligations. These investments can be made through original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly carry out a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. They will partner with local and regional interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability to interested parties. The pilot program will collect data on coastal oceans and inland waterways in partnerships with local and regional interests. Information to be collected includes wave heights, water temperature, coastal currents, large mammal movement, sewage outfall movement, and water quality. The pilot program will also involve tracking beaconed fishing boats, oil spills, beach erosion, weather patterns, river mouth sediment observation, and global information system coastal mapping in cooperation with the Geological Survey. The pilot program involves tracking fishing boats, oil spills, beach erosion, weather patterns, river mouth sediment observation, and global coastal mapping. Federal cooperation includes the Geological Survey, Navy, and EPA. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California Bight and Orange County. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish 2 regional test projects. One project will be in the Southern California Bight from Encinitas to Point Dume, with Orange County as the focal point. The second project location will be determined later. They will coordinate with existing Federal, State, and local efforts in monitoring ocean conditions without replacing or duplicating them. The program aims to coordinate with existing Federal, State, and local efforts in monitoring ocean conditions without duplication. $4,000,000 from the Beach Nourishment Account will be available annually for regional test projects. In fiscal years 2001 through 2006, $2,000,000 per year will be allocated for 2 regional test projects under this section."
