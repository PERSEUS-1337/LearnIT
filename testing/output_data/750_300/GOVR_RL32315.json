    "content": "Significant amounts of technically recoverable oil and gas resources are projected to be on federal public lands, but energy development is restricted in environmentally sensitive areas. These restricted areas may still contain substantial oil and gas reserves. The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue addressed in legislation such as the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute S. 2095. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands, reflecting Energy Task Force recommendations. Oil and gas development practices on public lands have sparked debate in Congress for years. The Bush Administration is expediting oil and gas permitting on federal lands, which has sparked debate in Congress for years. Originally, oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872, leading to concerns about abuse and wasteful use of public lands. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law in 1909. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law of 1872 in 1909. This led to the Pickett Act of 1910, which recognized executive branch authority for public land withdrawals. Congress later passed the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, removing oil and gas from the patenting process and keeping them under federal ownership. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing them under a leasing system that has generated billions in revenue for the federal government. This created split-estate situations where minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, leading to various ownership scenarios. The federal government's ownership of minerals under privately held lands creates split-estate situations. Various scenarios exist, such as surface and mineral rights held by different private interests or state-owned mineral rights with privately held surface rights. Federal statutes allow for patents to land while reserving mineral rights, making the mineral estate dominant. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders for mineral development, including meeting conditions for oil and gas extraction. The split-estate situation arises when the federal government owns minerals under privately held lands, with specific policies and procedures to be followed by mineral estate holders for mineral development. In Wyoming, 50% of lands are split-estate, and in Montana, about 57%. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals due to concerns about the Mining Law of 1872. Environmentalists and ranchers have expressed concerns about the impact of development on water and land, citing inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Development supporters argue that current environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands, including compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Development supporters argue that environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands, including compliance with NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other regulations. The industry faces delays in drilling due to environmental reviews. The industry faces delays in drilling on public lands due to environmental and other reviews. Proposed legislation aims to expedite permitting and address concerns over increasing domestic oil and gas supplies. Proposed legislation in H.R. 6 and S. 2095 aims to establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas development. Environmentalists and public land users are concerned about potential harm to the environment. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action after a cloture motion failed to pass. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, has not been approved due to a failed cloture motion. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. It discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. An Appendix gives historical background on land withdrawal from mineral development and the role of the Bureau of Land Management. The curr_chunk discusses U.S. energy demand and estimates reserves in restricted areas, focusing on onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development. It also mentions the role of the Bureau of Land Management and the application of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter. Industry has complained about the lengthy process. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. Resource Management Plans are required for tracts of public lands prior to development, with the Bureau of Land Management considering environmental impacts during planning. Management Plans or Land Use Plans are required for public lands prior to development. The Bureau of Land Management must consider environmental impacts during planning. These plans cover large areas and reflect diverse uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The impacts of various uses are identified early in the process to be weighed equitably. The plans also consider the needs of present and future generations and aim to maximize the benefits associated with public lands. The Bureau of Land Management's Management Plans for public lands consider environmental impacts and aim to maximize benefits for the community. Plans weigh various uses and must be consistent with regulations, allowing public participation. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through a competitive bidding process. The Bureau of Land Management determines lands with oil and gas potential for leasing through competitive bidding, ensuring a fair market value return to the federal government. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, noncompetitive leasing is offered within 30 days, remaining available for two years. If bids do not meet the $2/acre minimum, noncompetitive leasing is offered within 30 days and remains available for two years. Tracts can be obtained by the first qualified applicant with a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75. Simultaneous lease applications are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits are available on unleased lands. After a competitive lease sale, lease applications filed the day after are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, with specific procedures to follow. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on the land. After obtaining a lease through a competitive or noncompetitive process, the lessee is granted exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on the land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, following specific practices and procedures set by the surface managing agency (SMA). The Mineral Leasing Act requires the Secretary to analyze and approve a plan of operations for proposed surface-disturbing activities within the lease area before granting a permit to drill. The Mineral Leasing Act requires the Secretary to analyze and approve a plan of operations for proposed surface-disturbing activities within the lease area before granting a permit to drill. The application form (APD form 3160-3) must include a drilling plan, a surface use plan, and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan should contain information on drill pad location, pad construction, containment and waste disposal methods, and surface reclamation plans. The APD is posted for review for 30 days, followed by consultation with the surface managing agency and obtaining their consent. The APD is reviewed for 30 days, followed by consultation with the surface managing agency. BLM must process the application within 35 days, with possible outcomes of approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay for additional analysis. Despite the 35-day requirement, a recent study by IPAMS found delays in the region. The approval process for an Application for Permit to Drill (APD) involves a 35-day review period, but delays are common due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development. The average approval time in the region was 137 days in 2002, up from 84 days in 2001, according to a study by IPAMS. The need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) due to increased natural gas leasing and development is highlighted by both BLM and IPAMS. This is necessary because surface disturbance from approved activities may exceed old plan limits, requiring revisions before drilling permits can be issued. Several plans are currently being revised under FLPMA, section 1712, which mandates public involvement in developing, maintaining, and revising land use plans. Under FLPMA, section 1712, the Secretary of the Interior must develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement. Planning regulations require an environmental impact statement (EIS) under NEPA. After public comment on a draft EIS, an RMP can be approved by the BLM State Director and filed with the EPA. IPAMS testified before the House Committee on Resources regarding this process. The BLM State Director can approve an RMP after public comment on a draft EIS, which is then filed with the EPA. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs now takes up to three years, compared to less than a year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, down from potentially 20 years in the past, due to rapid coalbed methane development raising new land use concerns. The rapid pace of coalbed methane development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in Resource Management Plans (RMPs). Environmentalists argue that 20-year-old plans are outdated for making land management decisions, leading to delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits by the BLM. In April 2003, BLM announced new strategies to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing area development planning, and establishing standard operating practices for oil and gas operators. The BLM announced strategies to expedite the APD process, including area development planning and standard operating practices for oil and gas operators. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard terms, open with restrictions, or closed for leasing due to land withdrawals. Areas for oil and gas leasing are divided into three categories: lands open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, and closed to leasing. Closed areas consist of wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, and environmentally sensitive areas unlikely to reopen. Some lands are closed for planning or compliance reasons, while others are closed due to federal decisions on endangered species or historical sites. Some restricted areas may be opened in the future. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) study found that out of 700 million acres of federal subsurface minerals, approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Certain areas are closed for land use planning, NEPA compliance, or due to federal decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Some of these restricted areas may be opened in the future. Out of 700 million acres of federal subsurface minerals, approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those that are statutorily withdrawn. Another 182 million acres are subject to approval by the surface management agency and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas are examples of lands in this category. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry sources argue that some lease stipulations are overly restrictive. Industry sources argue that some lease stipulations, including directional drilling, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans, are overly restrictive and hinder oil and gas development on public lands. Industry representatives argue that federal withdrawals on public lands inhibit exploration and limit reserves, while environmental groups believe the withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands, with 37% of natural gas and 17% of crude oil resources. About 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region is on public lands, but 40% of it is not accessible due to lease stipulations and restrictions. This region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in natural gas access and Bush Administration policies. The Rocky Mountain region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in natural gas access and Bush Administration policies. Recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the region, including the National Petroleum Council (NPC) and Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments (EPCA) studies. The EPCA report focuses on five major geologic basins within the Rocky Mountain region. The EIA and NPC studies focus on natural gas supply in the Rocky Mountain region, with similar definitions of the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands available for development is consistent. The natural gas resource base in the Rocky Mountain region is estimated to be 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in the 1999 NPC study and 293.6 tcf in more recent EIA data. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in five major geologic basins in the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas available for development on federal lands remains consistent. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region, with 11.5% closed and 37% restricted. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the amount of natural gas open for leasing, with 60% and 51.5% respectively. The NPC and EIA studies report a significant difference in the amount of natural gas open for leasing, with 60% and 51.5% respectively. The EPCA study found 26 tcf of proven reserves on federal lands out of 43 tcf total in major geologic basins, with 63% open under standard lease terms. Including Rocky Mountain reserves would likely increase the percentage of natural gas open for leasing. The EPCA study found 63% of natural gas reserves on federal lands are open under standard lease terms. Including Rocky Mountain reserves would likely increase the open percentage and decrease restrictions. The study also identified 600 million barrels of oil resources under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. The EPCA study identified 600 million barrels of oil resources under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. Additionally, about 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The numbers in the EPCA study are based on a selective area of the Rockies, including five major geologic basins, resulting in smaller figures. The EPCA study found that the relative rate of restricted gas was 26%, while natural gas under standard lease terms was 62.4%. Both the NPC and EIA studies suggest that natural gas development in restricted land areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA also suggests that with more flexibility in federal regulations, around 29 tcf of natural gas could be developed immediately. The NPC and EIA studies indicate that developing natural gas in restricted land areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA suggests that with more flexibility in federal regulations, around 29 tcf of natural gas could be developed immediately. Additionally, removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop, freeing up a total of 80 tcf according to the EIA report. Environmental groups argue that there are ecological reasons for these restrictions and that environmental assessments are incomplete. Environmental groups argue that there is an ecological basis for most of these restrictions on natural gas development in the Rocky Mountain region, with incomplete environmental assessments. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf in 1999. Major policy disagreements exist regarding substantial oil and gas reserves on public lands. The Rocky Mountain region has an estimated total of 335 tcf of natural gas resources as of 1999, with 108 tcf currently restricted. There are major policy disagreements about the importance of these reserves in meeting U.S. energy needs. If the restricted natural gas is produced, it could last between 20-30 years at a production rate of 4 tcf to 5 tcf per year. The United States has a technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the onshore lower 48 states. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region were produced, it could last 20-30 years, meeting about 15% of projected annual U.S. demand. Currently, U.S. natural gas demand is met by supplies from the outer continental shelf (25%), imports (15%), the Rocky Mountain region (15%), and other onshore sources (45%). The Wilderness Society testified that the United States has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with 1,351 tcf of natural gas potentially available for future development. Based on the NPC figure of 1,466 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable resources in the U.S., 1,351 tcf of natural gas could be available for development in the future, with 16% subject to restrictions. The NPC estimates that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is currently under restriction or lease stipulations. The NPC report estimated that 16% of the 1,351 tcf of natural gas cited by TWS is subject to restrictions. Specifically, 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is under restriction or lease stipulations. The NPC proposes relaxing land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper suggests focusing on reserve categories for drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west, advocating for access restrictions only on the most viable resource categories. RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper recommends focusing on reserve categories for drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west, suggesting access restrictions only on the most viable resource categories. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decline to 5.3 million barrels per day by 2025. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, projected to decrease to 5.3 million barrels per day by 2025. Oil imports are expected to make up 65% of total U.S. supply in 2025. Federal onshore oil production is concentrated in Wyoming, New Mexico, and California. In 2002, federal onshore oil production in the U.S. was estimated at 5.4% of total production, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top producing states. Production has declined over the past decade, from 133.5 million barrels in 1992 to about 100 million barrels in 2002. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. U.S. natural gas production is projected to increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports are expected to rise from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Canadian reports indicate declining gas production, uncertain offshore supplies, and increased domestic use for oil sands production. LNG imports are projected to increase significantly from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands in the US has risen to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states contributing 85% of the total production. In 2002, gas production on public lands in the US increased to 2.2 tcf, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states contributing 85% of the total production. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is not expected to change significantly in the near term. U.S. proved oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels of oil as of December 31, 2002. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels of oil as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in both oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while U.S. production declined by 500 million barrels. 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered in 2001, three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. The U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, with production also decreasing by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, which was three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. Despite this, there are still substantial amounts of oil available in existing fields and undiscovered reserves in the United States. However, the rate of production is expected to continue declining over the long term. The United States has substantial oil reserves available from existing fields and undiscovered reserves, but the rate of production is expected to decline in the long term. The EIA estimates technically recoverable onshore and offshore oil resources at 92 billion barrels, with not all being recoverable. Additionally, U.S. gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf. The United States has seen an increase in gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries have increased by 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. The EIA estimates technically recoverable gas resources in the US to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land and may be available for exploration. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment shows 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. The Rocky Mountain West has 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in five priority basins. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with 25% being coalbed methane. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands account for 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil. Recent estimates by the EIA show that federal onshore oil is 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands is estimated to make up 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels and conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Additionally, undiscovered unconventional natural gas resources are estimated at 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is also mentioned as a type of natural gas dissolved in the region. The estimate for undiscovered unconventional natural gas is 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coalbeds and can be extracted by removing water through pumping. Fracturing coal formations can also release gas. Coalbed methane (CBM) extraction involves removing water from coal by pumping to lower water pressure, allowing gas to flow. Operators may fracture coal formations to facilitate gas movement, raising concerns about groundwater contamination. Water quality varies, with options for discharge based on freshness. Water disposal and quality are key issues in CBM production. In CBM production, water can be reused if fresh or disposed of through injection or discharge. Water quality and disposal are significant concerns. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized CBM development, leading to a four-fold production increase since 1991. In 2002, CBM wells produced 1.6 tcf of natural gas and 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Leading producers are in the United States. Production of coalbed gas in the United States has increased four-fold since 1991, with coalbed gas accounting for 8% of natural gas production in 2002. There were 10,000 CBM wells in 2002 producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day, mainly in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. DOE estimates 39,000 new wells by 2010, with 23,900 on federal lands. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the US are economically recoverable. By 2010, 23,900 new wells are expected on federal lands for coalbed methane production in the United States. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane are economically recoverable. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico accounting for over half of the reserves. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Colorado and New Mexico holding over half of U.S. reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf, with the federal government owning over half of the mineral rights. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, claiming 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf. Most of the current production of CBM is on private lands, with concerns arising over surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees. In Wyoming, concerns have been raised about surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees, particularly regarding fair compensation for damages from CBM or other extractive industries. Stakeholders have established the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative to address conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees, including environmental concerns about CBM. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 by stakeholders such as the Petroleum Association, ranchers, and the Farm Bureau Federation to resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees. Environmental concerns related to CBM production include land and water issues such as land disturbance, water usage, and disposal, affecting wildlife and surface water resources. The process of hydraulic fracturing for CBM production has raised concerns about the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water. A draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination from CBM hydraulic fracturing, but expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Major issues include surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water that may affect wildlife and surface water resources. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing due to its potential impact on underground drinking water. An agreement was reached in 2003 to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation includes provisions to prevent the EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Proposed energy legislation (H.R. 6 and S. 2095) may prohibit EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. CBM production can lead to water pollution in underground aquifers, with 602 million barrels discharged annually. CBM production results in water pollution as fluids seep into underground aquifers, contaminating drinking water wells with sodium-tainted water. Discharges of 602 million barrels annually typically go into surface waters or holding ponds, with concerns about groundwater contamination and the lowering of the water table. Holding ponds are criticized for leaking into groundwater, impacting wildlife water sources. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. is concerned about the impact of CBM production on groundwater quality and quantity. BLM has mandated CBM producers to drill two monitoring wells per township with CBM leases to address these concerns. The BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells to monitor water quality and levels from CBM production. Monitoring wells are not required on private lands. The Interior Board of Land Appeals invalidated three leases in April 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental environmental assessments were prepared for the Powder River Basin to guide CBM development in approved leasing areas, leading to more drilling with new conditions imposed on some producers. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases in the Powder River Basin due to violations of an IBLA ruling. BLM halted lease sales on public lands with high CBM content after the lawsuit. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM for violating an IBLA ruling to update a 1985 RMP before offering CBM leases in the Powder River Basin. BLM stopped lease sales on public lands with high CBM content while the ruling was being interpreted. The IBLA dismissed the case in December 2003. Wyoming BLM finalized a new EA and RMP, expecting to approve 39,000 permits for new wells over 10 years. DOI decided to start issuing permits in July 2003. Oil demand is projected to increase by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025. The DOI approved 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period in July 2003. Oil demand is forecasted to rise by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, leading to increased imports. Natural gas demand is also expected to increase by 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on U.S. public lands for oil and natural gas production, but the opposition and challenges remain unclear. Areas statutorily removed would require congressional action to change their status. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on U.S. public lands for oil and natural gas production. Challenges have been reported based on alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, with an increase in onshore unconventional natural gas production. Industry's central concern is to have greater access to federal lands with oil and gas potential. Onshore unconventional natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region is projected to increase its share to 43% by 2025. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental concerns focus on potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. Meeting U.S. energy demand may require a mix of increased domestic output and higher imports, with the Rocky Mountain region potentially contributing 40% of U.S. natural gas production by 2025. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms are actively exploring and developing resources worldwide, considering factors such as resource base, political stability, and financing. The proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms consider factors like resource base, political stability, and financing when making investment decisions. The United States is attractive for investment but environmental and societal impacts must be considered in public land use decisions. Terms for a competitive lease include maximum acreage, minimum bonus bid, term length, and bond requirement. Public land use decisions must consider environmental and societal impacts. Competitive lease terms include maximum acreage, minimum bonus bid, term length, and bond requirement. Noncompetitive leases have different terms. Rents and royalties are also specified. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. Rent and royalty rates are specified for competitive and noncompetitive leases. The Minerals Management Service collects significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury from bonus bids, rents, and royalties. Revenues are distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other programs. States receive a percentage of revenues from public land oil and gas leases, with Alaska receiving a higher percentage. Revenues from federal leases fluctuate due to price changes, with a notable increase in 2000. The Minerals Management Service collects 90% of revenues from federal leases, which vary due to price fluctuations. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering 17 million acres of public lands. The National Park System was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects. The National Park System (NPS) was created in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. Initially, there was tension between NPS and the Forest Service due to differing philosophies on resource use. During the early 1900s, tension arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests, as the Forest Service philosophy clashed with the idea of resource use for the greatest good. The debate focused on the Commander-in-Chief's authority to make land withdrawal orders based on national security concerns. Withdrawals were administrative actions that changed land designations from available to unavailable for various activities. The President's authority to make land withdrawal orders based on national security concerns was debated. Withdrawals changed land designations from available to unavailable for activities like homesteading and resource exploitation. While Congress has authority over public lands, Presidents have historically reserved some lands for specific purposes, such as military reservations. The President has the authority to withdraw or reserve public lands for specific purposes, such as military reservations, under various acts like the Antiquities Act and the Wilderness Act.
