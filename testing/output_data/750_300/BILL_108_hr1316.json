    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to pulmonary hypertension. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and historically incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) is a rare lung disorder with no known cause, historically chronic, and incurable with a poor survival rate. Around 300 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year, with the majority in women aged 21-40. However, PPH can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities. PPH can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities, with a low prevalence making it difficult to study. In some cases, PPH is familial, and in advanced stages, patients have limited activity and persistent symptoms. In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and symptoms even at rest, possibly leading to complete bedriddenness. PPH is often a diagnosis of exclusion and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH patient registry in 1981. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry, which followed 194 people with PPH over 1 to 7.5 years, contributing significantly to our understanding of the illness. Research is now focusing on immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of PPH. Research studies are investigating immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of PPH, as well as agents that narrow pulmonary blood vessels and factors that promote smooth muscle growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. Anorexic drugs taken by millions of Americans from January 1996 to December 1997 have been linked to PPH, with thousands now suffering from the disease. Almost 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs from January 1996 to December 1997, leading to cases of PPH. Many individuals are now in terminal stages or have died from the disease. It is expected that more cases of PPH related to diet drugs will be diagnosed in the future. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is caused by conditions like emphysema, bronchitis, and inflammatory diseases such as scleroderma and lupus. Common causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) include breathing disorders like emphysema and bronchitis, inflammatory diseases such as scleroderma and lupus, congenital heart diseases, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute will expand research on pulmonary hypertension and coordinate activities with other national research institutes and agencies. Additionally, Centers of Excellence will be established. The Director of the Institute will establish Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension through grants or contracts with public or nonprofit entities. The Director of the Institute will establish Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension through grants or contracts with public or nonprofit entities. These centers will conduct research, training, and education on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension will conduct training programs for scientists and health professionals, provide information to health professionals, and disseminate information to the public. Stipends may be provided for the training of health professionals. The Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension will conduct training programs for scientists and health professionals, provide information to health professionals, and disseminate information to the public. Stipends may be provided for the training of health professionals. The Director will coordinate information among centers and ensure regular communication between them. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center will use facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director will establish not less than three centers using facilities of a single institution or consortium of cooperating institutions. Support for each center may last up to 5 years, with possible extensions. The Director will establish not less than three centers using facilities of a single institution or consortium of cooperating institutions. Support for each center may last up to 5 years, with possible extensions. The Director of the Institute shall establish a data system for the collection, storage, and analysis. The Director recommended extending the period for the centers. A data system will be established for collecting and analyzing data on pulmonary hypertension patients. An information clearinghouse will also be set up for effective dissemination of information. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to enhance knowledge of pulmonary hypertension. Public input will be provided on existing and planned programs of the National Institutes of Health. The Director of the Institute will provide public access to information on National Institutes of Health programs related to primary hypertension and will receive feedback from the public. Biennial reports on activities will be prepared and included in the Director's overall reports. Authorization of appropriations will be made for implementation. The Director will provide public access to information on NIH programs related to primary hypertension and receive feedback. Biennial reports on activities will be included in the Director's overall reports. Authorization of appropriations up to $25,000,000 for each fiscal year 2004 through 2008 is authorized for this purpose."
