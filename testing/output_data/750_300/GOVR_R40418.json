    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. The DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded their laboratory capacity for studying dangerous pathogens, often referred to as high-containment laboratories. High-containment laboratories, funded by the federal government in response to 9/11 and anthrax attacks, play a critical role in biodefense efforts by studying dangerous pathogens and developing countermeasures. However, they also pose a risk of being a source for biological attacks. The federal government invested in research to develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens potentially usable in a terrorist attack, with funding increasing significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008. This funding supports academic and industrial researchers and laboratories handling these pathogens, raising concerns about aging infrastructure and limited capacity. The federal government's funding for research on dangerous pathogens increased significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008. This funding supports academic and industrial researchers and laboratories, leading to concerns about aging infrastructure and limited capacity. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally is driven by the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases has raised policy questions about the necessary federal investment, consolidation vs dispersion of labs, optimal size and type of labs, and the need for coordination among agencies. The expansion of high-containment laboratories internationally has prompted policymakers to consider the optimal size, type, and coordination of these facilities. Concerns about accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance have fueled the debate on balancing the benefits and risks of increasing laboratory capacity. The federal government regulates high containment laboratories to address risks such as accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter oversight. Biosecurity and biosafety concepts are explained, along with federal government mechanisms for oversight. The federal government regulates high containment laboratories to address risks such as accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. This report focuses on the federal government's regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, oversight mechanisms, proliferation of high-containment laboratories, issues facing federal policymakers, and policy options for congressional consideration. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens or biological materials from theft, unauthorized access, or illegal use. In this report, biosecurity involves securing pathogens or biological materials from theft, unauthorized access, or illegal use, while biosafety focuses on lowering the risk of unintentional infection in the laboratory or environmental release. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related but have developed independently, with biosafety being a concern for the laboratory science community for many years, while biosecurity has recently gained attention. The federal government established the Select Agent Program in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. The Select Agent Program was established in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. The program was a response to the threat of bioterrorism, with laws enacted in 2001 and 2002 to increase government interest and preparedness. The Select Agent Program, established in 1996 to regulate dangerous pathogens, was further strengthened by laws enacted in 2001 and 2002 after the anthrax mailings. These laws increased restrictions on possession of select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the government. The program oversees possession, transfer, and use of select agents, focusing on ensuring compliance with regulations. Scientists seeking access to select agents must register with the federal government, undergo background checks by the Department of Justice, and obtain nontransferable permits valid for five years. Facilities handling select agents are required to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the government. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use, focusing on controlling access to agents and ensuring compliance with regulations. Applicants provide information to the Department of Justice for background checks to handle select agents. Permits are nontransferable and valid for five years. Facilities must develop security plans to protect select agents, submitted to either HHS/CDC or USDA/APHIS for review and audit. CDC conducts announced inspections for regulatory compliance. As part of the Select Agent Program, agencies like CDC and USDA review facilities for regulatory compliance and security plan implementation. Failure to comply can result in fines, and possession of select agents without proper authorization may violate federal laws. As of February 2009, around 390 entities had certificates to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff approved for access. The majority of certified entities are owned by state or local governments, including public health laboratories. Violating the DOJ security risk assessment process or the USA PATRIOT Act may lead to charges under 18 U.S.C. 175 for possessing biological weapons. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions over the Select Agent Program have increased in academia due to the large number of academic entities and researchers. The Laboratory Response Network was established to have a lab in each state capable of handling dangerous pathogens. Tensions in academia over the Select Agent Program have risen due to the perceived burden of regulations. About 200 entities chose to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than comply with the regulations. The Select Agent Program's performance has been under scrutiny by agency Inspectors General. The Select Agent Program has faced scrutiny from agency Inspectors General, with investigations focusing on internal controls, processing applications, and regulatory compliance. HHS IG found non-compliance with regulations in universities and facilities receiving select agent certificates. The HHS IG found that universities and laboratories investigated did not fully comply with select agent regulations. Three entities withdrew their licenses. The USDA IG also found incomplete controls over registered entities' compliance. CDC suspended a select agent certificate at Texas A&M University in 2007. The USDA IG found incomplete controls over registered entities' compliance with select agent regulations. CDC suspended a select agent certificate at Texas A&M University in 2007 due to failure to report occupational exposures and lack of security risk assessments for laboratory workers. Other organizations have also been fined for violations of select agent regulations. The HHS OIG has fined 12 organizations a total of $1,887,000 for not complying with Select Agent regulations. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens are aware of the risks involved and have developed best practices to mitigate them, based on guidelines issued by HHS. The U.S. government began collecting best practices for handling dangerous pathogens in the 1970s and 1980s, issuing guidelines in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The CDC and NIH established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) with specific protections based on the pathogen's risk to human health. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines establish four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. Each level has specific protections, with higher levels for more dangerous pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are considered high-containment laboratories. These guidelines evolved from earlier efforts by the DOD, HHS, and USDA to protect lab workers from specific risks. The term \"high-containment laboratory\" refers to BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, with guidelines developed by DOD, HHS, and USDA to protect workers from specific risks posed by different pathogens. Criteria define biosafety levels and best practices for safe lab operation. Biosafety levels are linked to pathogen and experiment combination. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) outlines levels and mechanisms for determining appropriate biosafety levels based on the pathogen and experiment combination. It includes primary and secondary infection barriers, standard and special lab practices, and recent security guidelines. Researchers at federally funded institutions must adhere to these guidelines. The most recent edition of the BMBL includes security guidelines for different biosafety levels. Researchers at federally funded institutions must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, and the research activity. The Biosafety Level (BSL) guidelines categorize research procedures based on the potential for disease transmission and treatment. BSL-1 is for procedures unlikely to cause disease, BSL-2 for those with available treatment, BSL-3 for serious diseases, and BSL-4 for high-risk infections. The recommended level considers both the pathogen and procedure. The Biosafety Level guidelines categorize research procedures based on disease transmission potential. BSL-4 is for high-risk infections, while BSL-2 may be sufficient for handling select agents like anthrax. Pathogens on the select agent list can be handled outside high-containment facilities based on the Biosafety Level guidelines. Bacteria causing anthrax can be managed at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for others. 13 out of 73 select agents require BSL-4 containment, while 30 can be studied at lower levels. \"BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. Some BSL-3 facilities also handle select agents but are not subject to select agent regulations.\" BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may handle select agents but are not always subject to select agent regulations. BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion that fall under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary but widely adopted as facility policy, with some mandatory requirements for federal contracts and grants. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is generally voluntary but widely adopted as facility policy. Some mandatory requirements exist for federal contracts and grants, with noncompliance risking loss of funding. Various laboratories appoint health and safety officials to ensure equipment operation and guideline adherence. Non-profit laboratories appoint health and safety officials to verify the operation of protective equipment and ensure compliance with guidelines. The BMBL guidelines are also integrated into building design standards, federal requirements for DNA research, and the Select Agent Program. The BMBL guidelines are integrated into building design standards for federal facilities and those built using federal funds. These design standards align with the guidelines and may include additional security requirements. For example, the NIH has specific design specifications for their buildings, outlining requirements for ventilation, utilities, and access controls. The BMBL guidelines are integrated into building design standards for federal facilities and those built using federal funds. The design standards may refer to other security requirements, such as the NIH's design specifications for buildings. NIH issues checklists for high-containment laboratories to ensure requirements are met before occupancy. This process, known as certifying or commissioning a laboratory, is guided by NIH's commissioning guide and is similar in other agencies. Before a laboratory is occupied, it must be tested and certified to meet biosafety guidelines established by HHS through the BMBL. This process, also known as commissioning, is guided by the NIH's commissioning guide and is often outsourced to companies not involved in the facility's design or construction. The commissioning of a laboratory at a specific biosafety level is a crucial process guided by NIH's commissioning guide. It is recommended to involve specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, with extensive experience in designing, optimizing, and testing relevant systems. Individuals overseeing technical aspects of laboratory facilities should be licensed Professional Engineers with experience in design, optimization, remediation, and testing of systems. Compliance with biosafety guidelines, such as those in the BMBL, is crucial for labs receiving federal funding to avoid funding withdrawal. Federal funding for laboratories is contingent on compliance with biosafety guidelines like the BMBL. Non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of existing funding and the withholding of future funding. Grantee organizations may need to provide evidence of adherence to health and safety standards if requested by the awarding office. Similar requirements may be included in contracts and other award mechanisms. Grantees must adhere to Federal, State, and local health and safety standards, with evidence required upon request. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research necessitate the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee to oversee compliance with guidelines. The committee determines the appropriate biosafety level for research activities and can mandate specific precautions. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) oversees compliance with federal guidelines for recombinant DNA research, determining the appropriate biosafety level and mandating specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the IBC's oversight to other research with biosafety concerns, but concerns have been raised about its effectiveness. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) oversees research with biosafety concerns, determining protection levels for experiments. Some experts question the IBC's oversight effectiveness. The BMBL guidelines are incorporated into the Select Agent Program regulations, making compliance mandatory for entities possessing select agents. A biosafety plan considering the BMBL is required along with a security plan for compliance. The BMBL guidelines are mandatory for entities with select agents, requiring a biosafety plan and security plan for compliance. The number of high-containment laboratories in the US has significantly increased in recent years. The number of BSL-3 laboratories is not known, but the planned or existing BSL-4 space in the United States has increased significantly since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research activities, and a focus on public health. The federal government is investing in constructing high-containment laboratories in various departments. The federal government is investing in constructing high-containment laboratories in various departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. These facilities are creating both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense (DOD) has maintained a high-containment laboratory. The federal investment in high-containment laboratories is creating government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained these laboratories since World War II for offensive and defensive research, but the U.S. offensive biological weapons program was discontinued in 1969. The Department of Defense has transitioned from offensive to defensive research in biological weapons. President Nixon ended the U.S. offensive biological weapons program in 1969. DOD laboratories now focus on developing countermeasures to protect troops and preventive clinical research. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the only BSL-4 laboratory in DOD, with BSL-3 labs at other sites. DOD is investing $683 million to expand USAMRIID facilities for BSL-3 and BSL-4 research. The Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD, is the only BSL-4 laboratory in the Department of Defense (DOD), with BSL-3 labs at other sites. DOD is investing $683 million to expand USAMRIID facilities for BSL-3 and BSL-4 research, along with other DOD laboratories increasing their containment capacity since 2001 for infectious disease research, vaccine evaluation, and testing for disease outbreaks. The DOD maintains BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories for infectious disease research, vaccine evaluation, and disease outbreak testing. After the anthrax mailings, bioforensic responsibility was assigned to DHS in 2004. President Bush assigned bioforensic responsibility to the Department of Homeland Security in 2004 to identify perpetrators of biological attacks. The National Bioforensics Analysis Center was established as part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, currently located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD. Permanent facilities, including a BSL-4 laboratory, are under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility in Frederick, MD. This new BSL-4 laboratory will replace the existing facility and is expected to be fully operational in 2010. The DHS is replacing the PIADC facility with the NBAF, a BSL-4 laboratory in Kansas for researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The DHS is replacing the PIADC facility with the NBAF in Kansas to enhance research capabilities for animal pathogens. The HHS maintains BSL-4 laboratories at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, and at the CDC in Atlanta, GA, along with NBLs and RBLs for national research and testing on pathogens. The construction of two BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and thirteen BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) is underway. These facilities will support research on pathogens for the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' biodefense agenda and assist in public health emergencies. The NBLs are being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, while the RBLs are spread across the United States. The NBLs and RBLs are being constructed in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, respectively. The HHS has developed the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The LRN includes federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others. LRN is responsible for maintaining a network of laboratories to respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. These labs conduct diagnostic and public health testing, especially in emergency situations requiring additional testing capacity. Some labs have BSL-3 capabilities. USDA is conducting research in the new NBAF and building new BSL-3 labs in Ames, IA. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA and Fort Collins, CO, in response to increased federal funding for biodefense research. Academic institutions are also investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to enhance their ability to compete for federal funding. Universities are building more high-containment laboratory space in response to increased federal funding for biodefense research. This helps them compete for funding and attract new faculty. Private sector companies also maintain such facilities for medical testing and evaluation. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions are constructing or planning to construct additional BSL-3 laboratory space for medical testing, animal studies, and product development. Some companies justify in-house high-containment labs for their goals, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute for this capability. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers regarding capacity, oversight, risk, international ramifications, and local concerns after the 2001 anthrax mailings. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space due to the existing infrastructure being insufficient. Congress and the administration decided to construct more facilities, with the high costs requiring federal investment. It is crucial to balance the desire for increased laboratory capacity with the associated risks and costs, while also ensuring the full utilization of existing resources. The construction of high-containment laboratory space was deemed necessary after the 2001 anthrax mailings, with high costs requiring federal support. However, decisions were made without a national needs assessment, leading to concerns of over-building capacity. Policymakers are concerned about the excess high-containment laboratory capacity without a national needs assessment or coordinated planning. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but there are methodological shortcomings in the survey. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 laboratories in compliance with the Project BioShield Act of 2004. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had low response rates and methodological shortcomings. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, drawing heavily on the number of facilities registered to work with select agents, which has been criticized by experts. Entities registered to work with select agents may or may not use high-containment laboratories, and a BSL-3 laboratory may not necessarily work with select agents. Nongovernmental estimates show an increase in high-containment laboratory capability, with the Government Accountability Office noting a rise in laboratories. A government-wide assessment is needed to determine if ongoing construction has exceeded future national needs. The Government Accountability Office noted an increase in BSL-3 laboratories, but the exact number remains unknown. A government-wide assessment is necessary to determine if construction has surpassed future national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body to address capacity utilization concerns. Increased funding for research may be required to fully utilize additional capacity. The construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding for research, operations, and management. Agencies may struggle with funding increases when expanding their high containment laboratory capacity. An agency increasing its high containment laboratory capacity will lead to higher operations and maintenance costs, potentially requiring larger research budgets. Interagency federal planning efforts may help reduce overcapacity costs but would need agreement among agencies on facility prioritization and shared use. Congress may wish to consider multi-agency coordination for high-containment laboratory use, requiring agreement among agencies on facility prioritization and shared use. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections with select agents highlight the need for multi-agency coordination in high-containment laboratory use. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release into local communities and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections with select agents have led to a reexamination of the current oversight framework, with some experts calling for additional federal regulations. Some experts suggest expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories to include mandatory biosafety training and broader biosecurity measures, while others advocate for an enhanced self-regulatory approach with increased training in best practices and greater worker responsibility. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity has benefits such as enabling a greater diversity of biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to address these concerns. The increase in high-containment laboratories raises concerns about theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security and address these concerns. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses at some facilities participating in the Select Agent Program. The expansion of high-containment facilities has led to more facilities registering to possess select agents. Investigations have uncovered security weaknesses at some participating facilities. Regulatory focus on compliance with the Select Agent Program could help prevent such events, but the growing laboratory capacity may strain agency resources. Despite efforts to minimize accidents, they can still occur and overwhelm safety controls. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents, but risks still exist. The GAO testified that each facility has inherent risks, which increase with new constructions. The incremental risk is hard to measure and depends on compliance with regulations and best practices. Factors like accidental releases contribute to the overall risk. The incremental risk in high-containment laboratories is challenging to measure and varies based on compliance with regulations and best practices. Factors like accidental releases and subsequent illness contribute to the overall risk. Policymakers may estimate the cost/benefit of research in these labs and the potential costs of an infectious release. Cost/benefit analysis in high-containment laboratories considers potential benefits like biodefense breakthroughs and costs such as infected animals or lab workers. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects like national sampling lab networks and lab technique proliferation, impacting policy decisions. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the need for trained technicians and scientists to utilize the facilities. This can lead to risks associated with the \"insider threat\" as more individuals receive training in high-containment techniques. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the need for trained technicians and scientists to utilize the facilities. The risk of insider threats increases as more individuals receive training in high-containment techniques. Some experts believe that skills in high-containment technique are not necessary for bioterrorist attacks, while others argue they are crucial. The DOJ suggests that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist with expertise in high-containment techniques, which could have international implications. The DOJ asserts that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist expert in high-containment technique. The increase in high-containment capacity may have international ramifications, leading some countries to suspect the U.S. of developing offensive biological weapons. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention. The expansion of high-containment capacity in the U.S. may lead to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development, damaging efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention. This could also trigger the construction of similar facilities in other countries, increasing the risk of international proliferation of high-containment techniques for malevolent purposes. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries may impact business decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The differences in biosafety regulations among countries may influence the decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, potentially leading to the relocation of research and production facilities. This could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could affect national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks, potentially leading to restricted access to countermeasures during international crises. Governments may hoard domestically produced treatments, and differences in biosecurity regulations have caused some U.S. scientists to limit international collaborations. Some U.S. scientists are limiting international collaborations due to differences in biosecurity regulations, which could impact the scientific process and lead to barriers in research and industry investment. The collaboration between U.S. researchers and international partners may influence industry investment in countries with lower biosecurity barriers. The impact of biosecurity regulations on international collaboration and research is unclear. U.S. biosecurity standards could prompt other countries to adopt similar policies. Local resistance varies to the construction of high-containment laboratories in the U.S., with some groups supporting them for their mission importance. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced local resistance, with some groups supporting them for economic benefits while others oppose them for public health and quality of life reasons. Some groups support the construction of new laboratories for economic benefits, while others oppose them due to public health and quality of life concerns. Policymakers have various options to address these issues, including deferring action until expert panels provide their reports. In addressing these issues, policymakers have options such as deeming current efforts sufficient, deferring action until expert panels provide reports, or increasing oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel. Oversight balances security controls with research productivity, considering the trade-offs between additional oversight and scientific progress. One scientist highlighted the balance between security controls and research productivity in high-containment laboratories. Policymakers may find current oversight efforts adequate, as additional measures could hinder scientific progress. Opposition to additional measures for high-containment laboratory oversight, as some in the scientific community support relying on existing mechanisms. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists is more effective than increasing security in labs. Additional resources are suggested for intelligence on potential bioterror groups. Opposition to increased security in high-containment laboratories in the United States is supported by some in the scientific community. They argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists and disrupting their activities is more effective. Additional resources for intelligence on potential bioterror groups are recommended as a cost-effective way to prevent bioterrorist activities. The regulatory framework affecting domestic scientists is under scrutiny, with policymakers considering further action. Expert groups have been established since 2005 to address biosafety and biosecurity issues. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is also investigating high-containment proliferation. The government is addressing biosafety and biosecurity issues through various expert groups and investigations, including the Working Group on Strengthening Biosecurity. Congress may choose to endorse these efforts or require additional studies. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group consists of various government officials and is tasked with enhancing biosecurity measures. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, established by President Bush in 2009, consists of key government officials and is responsible for reviewing and evaluating existing laws and regulations related to biosafety and biosecurity. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, formed in 2007, is tasked with developing recommendations to address gaps in biosafety and biocontainment oversight of high-containment laboratories. Co-chaired by HHS and USDA, the task force aims to improve regulations and practices in this area. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, formed in 2007, aims to address gaps in oversight of high-containment laboratories. Co-chaired by HHS and USDA, the task force includes staff from various federal agencies and will present recommendations to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, with members from federal agencies and departments, is developing policies. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, with members from federal agencies and departments, is developing policies for oversight of dual-use research. The Board has working groups producing analysis and recommendations on an ongoing basis. The GAO is expected to release a report soon. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for oversight of dual-use research, including a code of conduct and biosafety training programs for researchers. The Board has working groups that analyze and publish recommendations regularly. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing high-containment laboratory issues and providing additional recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress should wait for these recommendations to avoid duplicating efforts and potentially undermining them, as they may generate new policy ideas or options. Congress may consider waiting for recommendations from the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the GAO regarding high-containment laboratory issues before taking action. This approach could prevent duplication of efforts and potentially lead to new policy ideas. Alternatively, Congress may choose to address the issue without waiting for reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of such laboratories have been inconclusive. Several policy options may facilitate addressing the issue of high-containment laboratories without waiting for executive branch or GAO reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of these laboratories have been inconclusive, with calls for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity from various sources. compiling such an inventory would be a complex task due to the diverse locations and work performed by non-federal laboratories. A comprehensive inventory of existing non-federal high-containment laboratories is needed, but it would be a complex task due to their diverse locations and work. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to gather information about their capacity, and a survey may not capture future construction or expansion. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be enough to identify existing high-containment facilities and their capacity. Concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden could hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government are potential solutions to increase participation. Mandating registration of all high-containment laboratories with the federal government could create a comprehensive list of facilities, providing valuable information on capacity and distribution. This approach could ensure better oversight and control, similar to the early implementation of the Select Agent Program. Registration of high-containment laboratories with the federal government could create a comprehensive list of facilities, ensuring better oversight and control. This could provide valuable information on capacity and distribution, similar to the early implementation of the Select Agent Program. The government could require federal agencies to report their high-containment facilities to Congress for efficient planning and resource allocation. A government-wide needs assessment could help determine if federal capacity exceeds the need. A government-wide needs assessment can help efficiently allocate resources by comparing it with existing federal capacity. Congress should consider the economic costs and benefits of surveying high-containment laboratories to avoid overexpansion and security concerns. Congress may need to evaluate the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories under different reporting frameworks and compare the information acquired with a needs assessment. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded laboratory construction to address concerns about overexpansion and security. Some policymakers propose a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to prevent overexpansion and security concerns. Policymakers must weigh the benefits of building the right amount of laboratory capacity against potential costs to research and other priorities. Without a government-wide capacity needs assessment, building more laboratories increases the risk of over-building or redundant operations. In the absence of a government-wide capacity needs assessment, building additional high-containment laboratories may lead to over-built or redundant operations. Incremental increases in capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may be more effective than constructing new laboratory space, as existing infrastructure could be expanded. Some agencies argue that their assessments show the need for new facilities due to outdated infrastructure. Without a government-wide assessment, agency-specific needs may not identify potential synergies. Enacting a construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals, such as delays in laboratory facility construction leading to delays in research activities. Without a government-wide assessment, agency-specific needs may not identify existing infrastructure or synergies. Enacting a construction moratorium could hinder the achievement of national goals, such as delays in laboratory facility construction impacting research activities and the establishment of a permanent bioforensics capability. Calls for expanding high-containment laboratory facilities may also be impeded. Some analysts propose licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations and prevent delays in facility construction and research activities. One proposed approach is to apply Select Agent Program requirements to all high-containment laboratories. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements universally. This could ensure a consistent security level across all facilities. Alternatively, a separate licensing program with its own requirements could offer more flexibility in regulating these laboratories. Establishing a separately administered program for licensing high-containment laboratories could provide flexibility in requirements, distinguishing between those with select agents and those without. However, challenges in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community may arise. Licensing may not cover all laboratories of concern, as select agents can be handled outside high-containment facilities in certain situations. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, capturing all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. This approach may have disadvantages, including challenges in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community. A more comprehensive approach to biosecurity oversight would involve monitoring all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, potentially impacting various sectors like public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Another approach could focus on expanding the select agent list to cover pathogens of concern. Expanding the select agent list to cover pathogens of concern, including diseases like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever, which are not currently regulated under the Select Agent Program. Some of these pathogens have been considered as potential biological weapons. Potentially dangerous diseases not covered by the Select Agent regulations include SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever. Expanding the regulated pathogens would lead to more high-containment facilities falling under the Select Agent Program. Some scientists are concerned about the current taxonomic definition of select agents, which may not accurately differentiate pathogens of concern. The NIH has expressed concern about the current taxonomic definition of select agents and is seeking scientific advances to identify select agents based on other features. This approach would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. Scientific advances are needed to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Regulatory impacts would target entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. This approach could limit disruption of scientific development and public health activities, focusing regulatory efforts on high-risk laboratories. Background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded. Background checks for personnel in high-containment laboratories, specifically BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, could be expanded to mitigate risks. This could involve implementing different levels of background screening based on the access to select agents or high-containment facilities. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may prefer to leave research fields. Efforts to improve personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may encounter challenges, including potential resistance from laboratory researchers towards government documentation and certification. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields rather than undergo the required government clearance. The effectiveness of personnel screening could be difficult to achieve, despite the Department of Defense having more extensive oversight programs. The Department of Justice highlighted a case where a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings, despite the increased oversight. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs, but the effectiveness of personnel screening may be challenging. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs and work risks, which allows for flexibility but also risks variation in quality. The regulations require training tailored to individual needs and work risks, allowing for flexibility but risking variation in quality. Experts suggest developing training standards to ensure core competencies are met, as current biosafety training programs may be insufficient to meet demand. Training could range from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification of competency. Expanded biosafety training programs are necessary to meet current demand and could range from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification of competency. The effects of such training may reduce laboratory acquired infections, but may not address biosecurity weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Training should also consider the dual-use nature of pathogens handled in high-containment laboratories. Enhancement of biosafety training to include considerations for the dual-use nature of pathogens in high-containment laboratories can address biosecurity concerns and promote a uniform understanding among workers. Lessons from incidents in these labs can inform future protocols, and implementing reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, may help improve overall safety. Lessons from incidents in high-containment laboratories can inform future protocols. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, are suggested to help disseminate information about accidents or near accidents in the research community. Fear of penalties or loss of stature may deter researchers from reporting events involving select agents. Enhancing the reporting system by establishing a database of accidents and remediation measures is suggested to improve information sharing and prevent future incidents in high-containment laboratories involving select agents. Fear of penalties or professional repercussions may hinder researchers from reporting such events. Experts recommend enhancing the reporting system by creating a database of accidents and corresponding remediation measures to prevent future incidents in high-containment laboratories. They suggest coupling this database with the Select Agent Program reporting requirements and minimizing penalties for reporting accidents to encourage compliance.

Policymakers need to balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden when crafting such programs. When crafting programs for high-containment laboratories, policymakers must balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden. Increasing federal oversight may face resistance but could reduce opportunities for misuse of infrastructure for biological weapons. Expanding the Select Agent Program could create barriers to public health response and international cooperation. Expanding the Select Agent Program may hinder public health response and international collaboration by increasing regulatory barriers for high-containment laboratories. Critics argue that timely material transfer between labs is crucial for responding to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. Expanding the Select Agent Program could hinder international collaboration and public health response by creating regulatory barriers for high-containment laboratories. This may impact timely material transfer between labs for responding to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. The licensing and certification regime could have significant impacts on regulated entities, affecting scientists not involved in biodefense activities. Expanding the Select Agent Program could hinder international collaboration and public health response by creating regulatory barriers for high-containment laboratories. The impacts of a licensing and certification regime on regulated entities, including scientists not involved in biodefense activities, could be significant. This could reduce scientific productivity in academic and industrial sectors, increase costs for public health laboratories and hospitals, and require additional federal resources for registration, inspections, and oversight of regulated facilities. Expanding the Select Agent Program could lead to increased costs for public health laboratories and hospitals due to regulatory activities. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being considered suitable regulators for biosafety and biosecurity programs. Policymakers may consider DHS as a more appropriate regulator for biosafety and biosecurity programs due to increasing homeland security concerns such as pathogen theft and malicious intent. If new authorities are developed, oversight could be conducted by the agency with existing statutory authority. If policymakers decide to create new authorities for biosafety and biosecurity programs, oversight could be split between different agencies. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and potentially consolidating oversight into one agency may be crucial for smooth implementation. The 111th Congress has begun to address the need for new authorities to regulate high-containment laboratories, which may require additional funding and staffing for oversight agencies. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity, which may require additional funding and staffing for oversight agencies. H.R. 1225 and S. 485 would extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for determining select agents. They also require the National Academy of Sciences to review the program, mandate biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents, and improve monitoring and inventory procedures. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for determining select agents. They also mandate biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents, improve monitoring and inventory procedures, and require evaluation of current and planned capacity in biodefense and infectious disease communities. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) aims to establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for voluntary reporting of biosafety incidents. It also authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. It also requires a report detailing activities to integrate the RBL network and assess the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity for biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. Biocontainment technologies are globally dispersed and utilized by scientists worldwide. BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity is crucial for responding to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies globally. International harmonization is necessary to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being used for bioterrorism. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight for these laboratories, which will impact policy decisions. Enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories is a key challenge for congressional policymakers. The choice of goal may impact the issues of concern and policies to address them. For example, a registry of existing capacity could improve planning and coordination but offer limited security benefits. A rigorous oversight program may enhance security but come with regulatory burden and increased costs, potentially hindering scientific progress. Enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories is a key challenge for policymakers. A rigorous oversight program may provide security benefits but come with regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and impeded scientific progress. Policymakers must reconcile competing national needs when considering policy options."
