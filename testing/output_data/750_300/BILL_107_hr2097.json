Research shows that quality early care and education lead to increased cognitive abilities, positive classroom behavior, long-term school success, and economic self-sufficiency. Approximately 13,000,000 children, including 6,000,000 infants and toddlers, receive child care daily, but only 1 in 7 meet quality standards. The cost of full-day child care can range from $4,000 to $10,000 per year, but Federal assistance is limited, making it difficult for many families to afford. Only 1 in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy development, while 1 in 8 centers pose threats to children's safety and health. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, making it hard for many families to afford. Families with a monthly income under $1,200 spend 25% of their income on child care. State reimbursement rates for child care providers are too low for quality care accessibility.

State reimbursement rates for child care providers are too low, leading to reduced quality of care for children. This includes cutting staff, training, and educational activities, which can result in delayed skills and increased aggression in children.

Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child care by allowing providers to attract and retain qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional training, maintain a safe environment, and purchase necessary supplies. The purpose of this Act is to enhance the quality and accessibility of child care through increased payment rates. The Act aims to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child care. Funding for improving the quality of child care is authorized with $500,000,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2002.
