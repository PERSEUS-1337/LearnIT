    "content": "The \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of the Act is to provide findings and purpose related to nanotechnology in schools. The \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" highlights Congress's findings on the benefits of nanotechnology, emphasizing its positive impact on society's well-being and the importance of maintaining leadership in this field. In order to maximize the benefits of nanotechnology in the United States, the country must maintain world leadership in nanoscience and microtechnology despite competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US in 2003. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the United States in 2003, with 55 percent of engineering doctorates awarded to them. Many of these students plan to return to their home countries after completing their studies. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US needs to invest in educating its own students in nanoscience research and development. The United States must invest in educating its students in nanoscience research and nanotechnology applications, providing access to necessary scientific tools and training for teachers and professors. The Act aims to enhance the capacity of US schools and higher education institutions in preparing students for nanotechnology careers by providing grants for necessary tools and training.

DEFINITIONS. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. The Act defines \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as equipment used in institutions of higher education or secondary schools, as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. The program authorized under Section 4 pertains to qualified nanotechnology equipment used for teaching in the classroom, with specific manufacturing requirements. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants up to $150,000 for eligible institutions to acquire equipment and software for teaching nanotechnology. An eligible institution can use a grant awarded under this Act to acquire nanotechnology equipment and software for teaching, provide educational services for students and faculty, and offer teacher education and certification. The grant awarded under this Act can be used by eligible institutions for acquiring nanotechnology equipment and software, providing educational services, and offering teacher education and certification. Up to 1/4 of the funds can be used for software, educational services, or other purposes. The grant awarded under this Act can be used for acquiring nanotechnology equipment, software, educational services, and teacher education and certification. Up to 1/4 of the funds can be used for these purposes. Grants to community colleges or higher education institutions can only be used in undergraduate programs. Applications and selection process are also outlined. The grant awarded under this Act can only be used in undergraduate programs at community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director for consideration. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment, including selecting eligible entities in diverse locations for grants under this Act. The Director will select eligible entities in diverse locations, encourage historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions to apply for grants under this Act. The Director will select eligible entities in diverse locations, encourage historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions to apply for grants under this Act, including institutions in EPSCoR states. Matching Requirement and Limitation: The Director may not award a grant unless the institution agrees to cover costs. The Director may not award a grant to an eligible institution under this Act unless the institution agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount. The Director may waive the matching requirement for institutions with low endowment values. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 are ineligible for further funding until 2. The waiver allows institutions with low endowment values to be exempt from the matching requirement. Branches or institutions receiving grants exceeding $100,000 are ineligible for additional funding for 2 years. If an institution other than a branch receives a grant over $100,000 under this Act, it cannot receive another grant for 2 years. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on the use of funds within 1 year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year based on the activities and outcomes. The Director will evaluate the program authorized by this Act based on reports from institutions receiving grants, assessing the impact on students, faculty, and staff. A report to Congress with recommendations will be submitted within 6 months of the evaluation.
