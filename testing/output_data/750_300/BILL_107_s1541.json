    "content": "The title of the act is the \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\". It also includes provisions regarding Federal-State agreements. Any State may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted regular benefits. Temporary emergency unemployment compensation is available to individuals who have used up their regular benefits under State law, have no other compensation rights, and are not receiving benefits from Canada's unemployment law. (c) Exhaustion of Benefits.--An individual is deemed to have exhausted their rights to regular compensation under a State law when no more payments can be made because they have received all available compensation based on their employment or wages during the base period. An individual's rights to regular compensation can be exhausted if all available payments have been received based on employment or wages during the base period, or if the benefit year has expired. The amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation payable for total unemployment is determined under the agreement. The amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation for total unemployment is based on the regular compensation payable under the State law for a week of total unemployment. The terms and conditions of the State law that apply to regular compensation also apply to claims for temporary emergency unemployment. The State law provisions for temporary emergency unemployment compensation align with regular compensation terms, with the maximum amount payable determined by the individual's account. The Governor of a State can elect to trigger an extended compensation period to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted their regular compensation rights under State law. The maximum amount payable is determined by the individual's account. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. The State will establish temporary emergency unemployment compensation accounts for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account equal to 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. The amount in an account under subsection (a) is equal to 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. It will be reduced by any extended compensation received under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The weekly benefit amount is the regular compensation including dependents' allowances payable to an individual for total unemployment under the State law. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation shall be equal to 100 percent of the compensation paid to individuals under the agreement. No payment will be made if the state is entitled to reimbursement under any other federal law. The State is entitled to reimbursement for compensation under Federal law other than chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation will be determined by the Secretary. Sums payable to States with agreements under this title will be determined by the Secretary in advance or as reimbursement. The amounts estimated for each calendar month may be adjusted based on prior estimates. The method for estimating these amounts will be agreed upon by the parties involved. The Secretary's estimates for prior calendar months may be adjusted if they were incorrect. The method for estimating these amounts will be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this title. The Secretary certifies sums payable to each State for payment by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to audit. The Secretary of the Treasury certifies and makes payments to States from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Funds are appropriated to assist States in meeting the costs of administering agreements under this title. Authorization of appropriations for certain payments is provided without fiscal year limitation to the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for compensation payable under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary estimates necessary payments under this section for compensation under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code and services under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the Unemployment Trust Fund. Appropriated amounts do not need to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. If an individual knowingly makes a false statement or fails to disclose a material fact to receive unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation, they will be ineligible for further benefits according to state laws on fraud in unemployment claims. Individuals who fraudulently receive temporary emergency unemployment compensation will be ineligible for further benefits as per state laws and may face prosecution under federal law. Those who received unauthorized payments must repay the amounts. Individuals who received unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation must repay the amounts to the State agency, unless repayment is waived if it was not their fault and repayment would be unfair. The State agency has the authority to recover the amount. The State agency can recover unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation by deducting from future payments to the individual if repayment is deemed fair and not the individual's fault. The State agency can recover unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation by deducting from future payments to the individual, with no single deduction exceeding 50 percent of the weekly benefit amount. Repayment shall not be made without an opportunity for a hearing. The State agency can recover unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation by deducting from future payments to the individual, with no single deduction exceeding 50 percent of the weekly benefit amount. Repayment shall not be made without an opportunity for a hearing, and any determination by a State agency under this section is subject to review in the same manner as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law. In this title, key terms are defined according to the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The applicability of these definitions is outlined in section 8. An agreement under this Act applies to unemployment weeks starting after the agreement is made and ending within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is a temporary reduction in interest rates for repayments of advances to state unemployment funds. SEC. 9. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO REPAYMENTS OF ADVANCES TO STATE UNEMPLOYMENT FUNDS. The interest rate paid by a State on advances under the Social Security Act will be reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent for 18 months after the enactment of this Act."
