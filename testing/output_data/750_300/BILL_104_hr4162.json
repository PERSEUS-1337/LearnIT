The plan shall allocate applicable contributions to qualified beneficiaries in the same manner as for beneficiaries without a qualifying event, including employer and employee contributions. Benefit accruals from voluntary employee contributions are also provided for. The plan allocates contributions to beneficiaries similarly, regardless of qualifying events. Benefit accruals from voluntary employee contributions are only available if they were prior to the event. Participants are deemed to have received compensation as if they continued in service.

This Act applies to plan years starting on or after July 1, 1996, with a special rule for defined benefit plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the Act's enactment date, exempting them until the termination of agreements or January 1, 2000."
