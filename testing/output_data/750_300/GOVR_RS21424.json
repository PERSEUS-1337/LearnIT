    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were deemed economically and technologically challenging to retrofit with new pollution control technology, while new sources were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. The CAA of 1970 implemented different approaches for existing and new stationary sources, giving states discretion to set emission standards for existing major air pollutants. The CAA of 1970 adopted different approaches for existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. States were given discretion to set emission ceilings for existing sources, while the EPA set strict technology-based standards for new sources that may endanger public health. The 1977 amendments further expanded regulations in certain areas. The EPA sets strict technology-based standards for new sources of air pollution, known as NSPSs. These standards require the use of the best demonstrated technology to achieve emissions rates. The 1977 amendments expanded regulations for major new sources in areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards, requiring them to undergo NSR before construction. This process includes obtaining a pre-construction permit with emission limits based on the best available technology. The Clean Air Act requires new sources of air pollution to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. Modifications of existing sources are also subject to NSPSs and NSR. The Clean Air Act mandates that new sources of air pollution must undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. Additionally, modifications of existing sources are subject to NSPSs and NSR, with regulations defining \"new source\" and \"modification\" triggering these requirements. The Clean Air Act requires new sources to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on technology. Modifications trigger NSPSs and NSR, with regulations defining \"modification\" as any change increasing emissions. The Clean Air Act requires new sources to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on technology. Modifications trigger NSPSs and NSR, with regulations defining \"modification\" as any change increasing emissions. The definition of modification includes changes that increase the amount of any air pollutant emitted by a stationary source or result in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted. This definition determines which changes in a source are subject to NSPSs and NSR, focusing on increases in emissions. The EPA defines \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components of an existing facility where the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost to construct a new facility. This definition triggers NSPSs and NSR, similar to modifications that increase emissions. The EPA defines a \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components of an existing facility where the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost to construct a new facility. This definition triggers NSPSs and NSR, similar to modifications that increase emissions. In contrast with modifications, a change in a facility can constitute a reconstruction irrespective of whether it increases emissions. EPA's definition of \"modification\" echoes the act's definition, but also states six kinds of changes in a stationary source the Agency does not consider to be modifications. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes six exceptions for changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications, such as maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR). These exceptions were developed to prevent every minor change from triggering heightened pollution-control requirements. EPA regulations did not specify the activities included as RMRR until recently. The EPA's RMRR exception allows for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities without triggering pollution-control requirements. Previously, eligibility for this exemption was determined through case-by-case analysis, as seen in the WEPCO case. The EPA's case-by-case approach for determining the RMRR exception was approved in the WEPCO case, where extensive renovation was proposed, triggering NSPS and PSD-area NSR requirements. EPA dismissed WEPCO's argument that the proposal qualified as RMRR. The EPA determined that WEPCO's proposal triggered NSPS and PSD-area NSR requirements, requiring a permit before construction could begin. In the WEPCO case, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the proposal went beyond RMRR due to the substantial and unprecedented extent of work on the plant. The project's purpose, infrequency, and high cost all pointed to non-routineness. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years. The court ruled that the work on the plant was substantial and unprecedented, indicating non-routineness due to the project's purpose, infrequency, and high cost. The RMRR exemption has been a significant issue, highlighted by CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for exceeding routine maintenance. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group also issued recommendations in May 2001. In 2002, EPA published final regulations affecting NSR, following President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group recommendations in 2001. The regulations specified categories of activities that qualify as \"routine maintenance.\" The EPA's 2002 report to the President highlighted the impact of NSR regulations and recommended specifying certain categories of activities as \"routine maintenance.\" Final regulations were published on December 31, 2002, affecting how emission increases are calculated for NSR purposes. Additionally, a rule was proposed to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as RMRR without other considerations. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as RMRR without other considerations. The Eleventh Circuit made a decision in EPA v. Whitman, where the EPA found TVA violated the CAA with rehabilitation projects beyond RMRR without permits. EPA's Environmental Appeals Board affirmed the determination and endorsed the agency's multi-factor test for RMRR. The Eleventh Circuit found that the EPA's ACOs were unconstitutional as they could impose penalties without proof of violation in district court, allowing TVA to violate the ACOs. The Eleventh Circuit found EPA's ACOs unconstitutional as they could impose penalties without proof of violation in district court, allowing TVA to violate them without fear of penalty. The October 2003 final rule reshaped the contours of RMRR by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR. The October 2003 final rule reshaped RMRR by declaring specific equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. The new rule on RMRR, finalized in October 2003, specifies that certain equipment replacement activities are considered RMRR without sacrificing environmental protection. EPA is not currently addressing the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The new rule on RMRR, finalized in October 2003, allows for the replacement of components of a process unit with identical components or functional equivalents as long as the replacement cost is less than 20% of the current replacement value, does not change the unit's design parameters, and the unit continues to meet emission and operational limitations. The new rule on RMRR finalized in October 2003 allows for the replacement of components with identical or functional equivalents as long as the cost is less than 20% of the current replacement value, without changing design parameters, and meeting emission and operational limitations. The new approach allows for more replacements compared to the former case-by-case approach, with the latter remaining as an alternative. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed under the new rule. The new rule on RMRR finalized in October 2003 allows for component replacement with identical or functional equivalents if cost is under 20% of current value, without changing design parameters, and meeting emission and operational limitations. The new per se approach is expected to reduce the use of the case-by-case approach. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The rule applies only to conduct after its effective date and does not affect pending CAA enforcement actions. Multiple states have filed lawsuits challenging the rule. In lawsuits challenging the equipment-replacement RMRR rule under the CAA, multiple states and environmental groups argue that it exceeds EPA's authority. The court granted a stay on the rule pending full review. The court granted a stay on the equipment-replacement RMRR rule under the CAA, pending full review in the State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency case. EPA faces an uphill battle in defending the rule, as the court found irreparable harm and likelihood of success for the petitioners. The new rule is suspended, and the old case-by-case approach continues to apply. The court suspended the new equipment-replacement rule under the CAA, leading EPA to face challenges in defending it. The old case-by-case approach remains in effect, with the court declining to consolidate the cases but assigning the same panel for related cases."
