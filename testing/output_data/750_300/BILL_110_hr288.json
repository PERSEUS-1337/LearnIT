    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. The primary insurance amount is adjusted to include a transitional increase amount if applicable. The primary insurance amount for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989 includes a transitional increase amount, calculated based on the excess under former law and the applicable percentage for the year of eligibility. Individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1979 and 1988 receive transitional increase amounts based on the applicable percentage for the year of eligibility: 60% in 1979-1980, 35% in 1981-1982, 30% in 1983-1984, 25% in 1985-1986, and 10% in 1987-1988. Individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1979 and 1988 receive transitional increase amounts based on the applicable percentage for the year of eligibility, ranging from 60% in 1979-1980 to 10% in 1987-1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and their primary insurance amount calculated without certain provisions. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the primary insurance amount of an individual calculated under previous laws, disregarding certain provisions. The insurance amount is determined based on previous laws, with specific modifications and exceptions applied. The insurance amount calculation is modified with exceptions, including the exclusion of certain calendar years and the inclusion of the 3 years with the highest wages and self-employment income. The insurance amount calculation is modified for individuals aged 61 and older, including the 3 calendar years with the highest wages and self-employment income. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Individual entitled to benefits in December 2006 may have their benefits recomputed to reflect increases. Individual entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 2006 may have their benefits recomputed to reflect benefit increases. The Commissioner of Social Security will recalculate the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act to reflect benefit increases."
