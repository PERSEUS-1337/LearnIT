The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a spending limitation for fiscal year 2006 and beyond. Any budget resolution must adhere to this limitation, with a two-thirds majority vote required to waive or suspend it. The Senate requires a two-thirds majority vote to sustain an appeal of the chair's ruling on a point of order. Appeals are limited to one hour and divided between the mover and the manager of the resolution. SEC. 13. REDUCTION OF FICA RATES RESULTING FROM PERSONAL SOCIAL SECURITY SAVINGS PROGRAM. Employee Contribution section 3101 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance in years following a reduction year. The reduction year is defined as any year after the transition year when the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The reduction percentage is the excess of the rate in effect under subsection (a). The term 'reduction percentage' is defined as the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate that would result in an OASDI rate ratio of 125 percent. The OASDI rate ratio is the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund divided by the amount paid from the Trust Funds during the calendar year. The reduction in Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance tax rate is based on the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate needed for an OASDI rate ratio of 125 percent. This reduction applies to the rate of tax imposed on employers under subsection (a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax rate imposed under subsection (a) will be reduced in each year following a reduction year by the reduction percentage, with a limitation to ensure it does not fall below 4.95 percent. This reduction also applies to the self-employment contribution tax under section 1401 of the Internal Revenue Code. The terms 'reduction year' and 'reduction percentage' are defined in section 3101(d). Any reduction that would lower the tax rate under subsection (a) to less than 9.9 percent is not allowed."
