    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for agricultural producers to maintain prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production. Congress recognizes the need for federal assistance to protect these lands due to the lack of incentives from states and local governments. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 aim to provide federal cost sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements under a new section added to the Act. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 introduce definitions related to farmland protection easements, including qualifying farmland and eligible states. Eligible states must have a program approved by the Secretary to acquire farmland protection easements. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 define an eligible state as one with an approved program to acquire farmland protection easements. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible states for acquiring these easements to protect farmland from non-agricultural uses. Matching grants are typically on a 50-50 basis, but can be up to 90 percent for states actively developing such programs. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 allow eligible states to receive matching grants of up to 90 percent for acquiring farmland protection easements. The grants aim to protect farmland from non-agricultural uses, with priority given to lands crucial to the state's agriculture industry. The purchase price of easements acquired using these funds should not exceed fair market value. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 authorize matching grants for states to acquire farmland protection easements, prioritizing lands important to the agriculture industry. The purchase price of easements should not exceed fair market value. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
