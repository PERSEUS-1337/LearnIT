    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until the final FY2011 DOD budget. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine in 2011, terminating the F-35 engine competition. On October 26, 2001, the Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition. Congress required an alternate engine, the F136, to be developed for the F-35. Despite Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued funding until FY2011 when the program was officially terminated. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated by the DOD in FY2011 after being rejected by Congress in previous years. Supporters of the termination argue that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. Additionally, maintaining two engine pipelines would raise operation and support costs, especially on aircraft carriers. International interest in the F-35 does not require a second engine. Having a second engine for the F-35 is not necessary as international interest in the aircraft is already high. Congress and DOD accept the risks of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants. The development and production of the F135 engine have progressed to a point where an alternate engine program is no longer needed to hedge against technical problems. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 is being opposed due to concerns about compliance with the FY2008 defense authorization act. The act requires the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production for the Joint Strike Fighter. Given the importance of the F-35 in the country's strike fighter fleet, critics argue that it would be imprudent to rely solely on the F135 engine without a backup option. The proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 is being opposed due to concerns about compliance with the FY2008 defense authorization act, which requires 2 options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production for the Joint Strike Fighter. Critics argue that relying solely on the F135 engine without a backup option could pose risks to the entire F-35 fleet. Having a second engine in production would allow for competition in procurement and support, potentially reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. Having two production lines would also enable quicker response to strategic changes and maintain competition in future tactical aircraft engine development. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with all tooling and engines ordered to be returned. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011, despite concerns about maintaining competition in engine production for future tactical aircraft. On December 2, 2011, General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of their self-funded development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The estimated cost of the F135 SDD contract increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion, with $1.7 billion for F136 engine SDD work from FY2005-FY2009. Between FY1995-FY2009, $1.7 billion was allocated for SDD work on the F136 engine. The F136 team did not work on STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. The government operated under continuing resolutions until the final FY2011 DOD appropriations act was enacted on April 15, 2011. Some members of Congress questioned the program's status during this period due to the Administration's opposition to further funding for the alternate engine program. The CR effective through March 4, 2011, set DOD spending at a rate consistent with FY2010 levels. The Office of Management and Budget Director assured funding on a pro-rata basis. The alternate engine program was funded at FY2010 levels until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified about the program's costs and challenges. The government added $1.8 billion for the alternate engine program, expecting it to cost $2.9 billion over five years. However, analysis shows little benefit to taxpayers as most customers will only buy one engine. The Marine Corps and Navy plan to use only one engine due to limited space. The F135 engine program is progressing well, while the F136 engine has encountered development issues. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of the second engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley and Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine for the F-35, citing technological advancements and potential negative impacts on the number of aircraft produced. The F-22 and F-18E/F are single-engine airplanes, with General Schwartz questioning the need for an alternate engine for the F-35 due to technological advancements and potential impacts on production numbers. Adm. Roughead and Gen. Cartwright also expressed skepticism about the value of investing in a second engine. The need for an alternate engine for the F-35 is questioned due to the high cost of developing and maintaining a second engine. The Administration believes the alternative engine program is no longer necessary as a hedge against the main Joint Strike Fighter engine program's failure. Financial benefits from competition between the two variants are deemed small, if they exist at all. The OMB stated that canceling the alternate engine program for the F-35 will result in estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars. GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield enough savings to offset the costs of competition over the JSF program's life. They estimated that continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. GAO also highlighted the success of the \"Great Engine War\" in the 1980s, which resulted in significant savings in acquisition and operational costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted potential savings from competition in the F-35 program, including 21% in overall life cycle costs. Proponents of the alternate engine point to cost growth in the F135, while the Administration argues that the benefits of a second engine do not outweigh its costs. Secretary Gates mentioned cost growth is manageable with additional budget allocation for program risk reduction. The Defense Department created a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine. The JAT's charter included understanding production costs and developing a plan for cost and affordability. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan. Defense Department officials rejected proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The Pentagon memo explains the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy for the F-35 program. Despite reduced costs for developing the F136 engine, the analysis concludes that having two competing F-35 engine programs does not offer significant cost savings. Pratt & Whitney received funding for additional F135 engines and production improvements. The Pentagon rejected proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy for the F-35 program, citing that having two competing engine programs would not offer significant cost savings. Approximately $400 million of the allocated funds would be for engine improvements, with a third required to meet the original specification and two-thirds to increase design robustness. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were conducted in 2007, with differing conclusions on the financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were also noted, including improvements in fleet readiness and contractor responsiveness. The CAIG study analyzed non-financial benefits of an engine competition for various fighter programs, assuming favorable cost performance. It projected a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper reduction in production costs with competition. The CAIG study estimated a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper reduction in production costs with competition. It found that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs would be needed for a break-even point, with a 25.6% reduction required on a net-present-value basis. The study suggested that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve the necessary savings by 2040, but was skeptical that a 25.6% savings could be attained. The CAIG study discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth between Critical Design Review (CDR) and Initial Operational Capability (IOC). Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was close to exceeding its designed engine temperature specifications, requiring modifications for thrust growth. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating a gross savings of 11% to 18% with an F-35 engine competition. Past studies showed an average savings of 14.6%. The IDA study estimated that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. It concluded that recouping these costs through procurement-cost savings alone would be unrealistic, requiring a 40% savings. Contractor responsiveness was a key factor in the Great Engine War, with the study highlighting the importance of having an alternate engine to mitigate the risk of grounding the F-35 fleet. The study suggested that having an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent the entire fleet from being grounded due to engine issues. It stated that cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20%. The GAO director believed the program would reach its break-even point by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, the program was recommended to continue for its non-financial advantages. The alternate engine program for the F-35 is recommended to continue for its non-financial benefits, despite marginal financial gains. The size of the F-35 production run will impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for the alternate engine program, influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' procurement decisions. GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney have made offers for engine production. The GE/Rolls-Royce team offered to build F136 engines for a fixed price after the first few lots, while Pratt & Whitney proposed a cost-plus contract for the F135. Pratt & Whitney and DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV. The cost of LRIP IV F135s was reported to be 16% lower than LRIP III. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 outlined the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF. The production work for the JSF Air System includes production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The MOU scope of work includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems subject to funding availability. The provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid. The Department will continue to implement its obligations regardless of the outcome of the U.S. FY10 funding requests. The Administration decided not to include the F136 engine in its RDT&E funding requests. European countries with firms involved in both F135 and F136 programs may change their stance on the second engine based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supported the F136, citing potential long-term costs. Both JSF engines faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing. The F135 engine experienced failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to high-cycle fatigue, delaying the first flight of the F-35B aircraft. These engine malfunctions contributed to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million. An F135 was damaged in a test in 2009, attributed to a worn bushing. The F136 engine also encountered three test incidents. The F136 engine encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor, impact damage to turbine blades, and damage to fan and compressor. Pratt & Whitney confirmed that a 'small number' of F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue identified during ground testing. Since March, test and production engines have been replaced with spares due to a mis-assembly issue found in a ground test engine. Pratt & Whitney faced criticism for quality control deficiencies leading to increased F135 costs, with concerns raised about scrap and rework rates. The company defended its performance, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate and overall, they were running at a 97 percent yield rate for the total engine. The president of business development defended the company's performance, stating a 97 percent yield rate for the total engine. General Electric F136 achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to start tests of a higher-thrust F135. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or accept termination. Funding sources for the program may impact other DOD programs. The source of funds for the alternate engine program may impact other DOD programs, potentially leading to cuts in F-35 activities. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could result in fewer F-35s procured or delays in the program. The cost of fielding and supporting two F-35 engines is comparable to just one engine. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine due to congressionally directed appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The lifetime cost and upfront cost of developing the F136 are being discussed, with supporters citing a study showing potential balance over the engine's life. Supporters of the F136 engine argue that the upfront cost of its development could be offset by savings from competition over the program's lifetime. The role of competition in controlling costs is a key point of contention, with different studies offering conflicting views. Congress must decide which assumptions to trust regarding the impact of competition on cost. Proponents of a second engine for the F-35 highlight the benefits of competition in preventing cost escalation and argue that the risk of relying on a single engine type for the majority of future U.S. fighters should be carefully considered. Supporters of an alternate engine for the F-35 argue that using a single engine type poses a risk of all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. The Marine Corps and Navy have experienced groundings due to engine problems in the past. However, DOD officials believe that terminating the alternate engine program poses little operational risk due to advancements in technology like computational fluid design and advanced software for engine health monitoring. The use of advanced software for prognostic health monitoring in aircraft engines can reduce operational risks. Despite arguments for an alternate engine, logistical issues may complicate its use, as noted by Navy and Air Force officials. The debate over the alternate engine for the F-35 focuses on whether the Pentagon should pay General Electric up to $3 billion to compete with Pratt & Whitney. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines and its market share in commercial aircraft engines are key considerations in this complex issue. General Electric has a significant share of the market for commercial aircraft engines and also supports military engines for the Navy and Marine Corps. A 2007 study noted General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market, producing more engines than Pratt & Whitney. The study raised concerns about the impact on General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines if the F136 program were terminated. The 2007 CAIG study highlighted that terminating the F136 engine program could hinder General Electric's ability to compete for military engine contracts. It also warned of potential disruptions in the F-35 engine spare parts supply chain. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines may create uncertainty for suppliers, but it is unlikely to force any supplier out of the domestic industrial base. The 2007 CAIG study warned that terminating the F136 engine program could hinder General Electric's military engine contract competitiveness and disrupt the F-35 spare parts supply chain. Maintaining competition between F135 and F136 engines may create supplier uncertainty but is unlikely to force any out of the domestic industrial base. The IDA study of 2007 concluded that the U.S. industrial base would benefit from an active F136 program, enhancing competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for future engine development. Pratt & Whitney and General Electric's competition in engine development proved invaluable. Congress may consider non-monetary value in engine choice. H.R. 1540 includes language on competitive procurement for F-35 engine improvements. The text discusses the competitive development and production of the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program, emphasizing performance improvements related to fan or core engine airflow volume and maximum thrust. It excludes improvements in weight, costs, durability, and other factors. Additionally, it mentions a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Department of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The plan must ensure that the property can be used for restarting development, long-term sustainment, and repair, and can be stored at government facilities or contractor sites. It also includes identifying costs for restarting development, providing support for contractor activities, and determining any necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving property related to the F136 propulsion system. The plan must ensure the property can be used for future development and testing, and the Secretary must provide support and access to the property for the contractor at no cost to the government. The committee praises the contractor for continuing development and testing of the F136 propulsion system despite the Department of Defense's attempts to cancel the program. They believe that competition for the F136 is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program, leading to better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a stronger industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements to the F-35 propulsion system without competitive development. The Administration opposes the development of an extra engine for the F-35 program, citing significant extra costs and destabilization. They also object to a requirement to store and preserve property from the terminated F136 program, which they consider unnecessary and costly during a period of fiscal restraint. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act, on May 26, 2011. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The conference report on H.R. 1540 addresses the preservation and storage of F136 assets owned by the Federal Government. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the disposition of property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring long-term sustainment and repair of the property. This plan should also identify any necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the F136 propulsion system property disposition, with restrictions on funds use until a report is submitted to Congress. The plan should maximize the government's investment in the F136. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine. The legislative history appendix details the program's funding from FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill and report language. The F-35 alternate engine program received additional funding recommendations, previously known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for JAST, required a report, and limited fund obligation. The program's requirements and planning assumptions were discussed in the conference report. The Senate report (S.Rept. 104-112) raised concerns about the lack of engine competition and the size of flying prototypes in the JAST program. It directed the Department to include two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies and ensure adequate engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft. The conferees recommended authorization of funds reflecting these changes. The conferees recommend authorizing funds for competitive engine programs and demonstrator aircraft, including $7.0 million for competitive engine concepts. The Senate report expressed concerns about the lack of engine competition in the JAST program and directed the evaluation of at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies. The House Appropriations Committee report discussed the challenges with developing new fighter engines, citing dissatisfaction with engine performance on various aircraft models. The JAST program's decision to use a single unproven engine design, based on the F-22 engine, was criticized given past engine performance difficulties. The Committee criticizes the decision to use a single unproven engine design for the JAST program, based on the F-22 engine. They believe it is essential to pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer for cost-effectiveness and have allocated an additional $20,000,000 for this purpose. The Senate Armed Services Committee also emphasizes the importance of engine competition for future aircraft. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208) included funding for the JAST program to accelerate development of an alternate engine. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) required a report on the production and fielding sequence of the joint strike fighter variants. The congressional defense committees requested a report on the production and fielding sequence of the joint strike fighter variants, including funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about inadequate funding for the alternative fighter engine and directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a detailed report by February 15, 1998. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing funding for the alternative engine program for the joint strike fighter. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase in the budget request to accelerate the program, expecting sufficient funds in future years. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended increasing funding for the joint strike fighter program in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. The committee noted the timely submission of Department of Defense priorities and plans, including a funded program for an alternate engine. However, the demonstration of the alternate engine in a JSF airframe has been continuously delayed, posing a risk to the initiative. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended increasing funding for the joint strike fighter program in fiscal year 1999 and beyond, including an increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF. The House Armed Services Committee also expressed strong support for the development of an alternate engine to ensure sustainment of critical industrial base capabilities and control engine cost growth for the planned fleet of 3,000 JSF aircraft. The committee is concerned about the funding levels for the development of an alternative engine for the JSF aircraft. They note an increase in funding for other jet engine development efforts but recommend prioritizing the new state-of-the-art engine for JSF. The committee recommends decreasing funding for one program and increasing funding for another to support the development of the alternative engine. The committee recommends reallocating funds to prioritize the development of an alternative engine for the JSF aircraft. This includes a decrease in one program's funding and an increase in another program specifically for accelerating the alternate engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee report highlighted concerns about the viability of the alternate engine and recommended additional funding to reduce risks and speed up its development. The conference report on the FY2001 Defense Authorization Act discussed concerns about additional contractor funding for the JSF program, emphasizing the need for funding for risk mitigation projects like the alternate engine. The conferees opposed requiring industry to make unreimbursed investments beyond existing agreements. The House Armed Services Committee supports funding risk mitigation projects for the JSF program, including the alternate engine. They recommend measures to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base and continuation of the JSF alternate engine program. The JSF AEP will not complete development until after lot five of the JSF production program. The Committee supports accelerating the development of the JSF alternate engine to ensure compatibility with the airframe. They recommend additional funding to expedite the process and maintain the current AEP schedule. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act discusses the JSF program and the need to develop and integrate the alternate engine within the EMD program. The House Armed Services Committee report highlights concerns about technical risks and the lack of funds to reduce development schedule risk for the alternate engine common hardware components. The JSF program aims to develop a family of aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies with commonality among variants to minimize costs. The committee recommends increased funding to reduce development schedule risk of the alternate engine common hardware components. The funding for the JSF alternate engine common hardware components was increased by $10.0 million in FY2003. Additionally, the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act recommended an additional $56 million for the JSF program to ensure competitive procurement of the interchangeable engine. The committee recommends increasing funding by $56.0 million to continue the F136 interchangeable engine development on its original schedule. The Department of Defense should make financial adjustments to restore the engine's schedule, as a previous cut resulted in a $56 million reduction in research and development efforts for fiscal year 2004. The Committee recommends a total cut of $56,000,000 to the Joint Strike Fighter program, with exceptions for the F136 engine program. They also suggest restoring the fiscal year 2004 cut to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program and adding $20,000,000 for risk reduction. The House Armed Services Committee report discusses the JSF program and the mandate for funding an alternate engine program to maintain competition. The JSF Joint Program Office is working on interchangeable engines for the JSF program, with Congress mandating funding for an alternate engine program. The committee supports early engine production lot competition and directs the JSF JPO to plan for competition of engine common hardware and turbomachinery while maintaining engine interchangeability. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act ensured funding for the engine program despite efforts to eliminate it. The committee supports the development of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, as mandated by the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of Defense, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, are expected to remain committed to the competitive engine development for the JSF. The Secretary is prohibited from making modifications to the acquisition program for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft that would change the propulsion system, unless specific conditions are met. Independent cost analyses of the engine program are required to be conducted by various entities. The Secretary of Defense must conduct independent cost analyses on alternative propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, including using the F135 engine only, a firm-fixed price contract for a selected propulsion system, and competitive engine selection. Reports on these analyses must be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The CEO of the research center must submit a report to Congress on the cost analysis of alternative propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The report should include key assumptions, methodology, life-cycle cost comparisons, manpower estimates, engine procurement numbers, and non-cost benefits of competition. The report to Congress must include an assessment of performance, readiness, risk reduction, technology innovation, and contractor responsiveness for engines in tactical fighter aircraft. It should also describe past acquisition strategies for engines in aircraft like the F-15, F-16, F-18, and F-22, compare experiences under past acquisition programs, assess the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base, and provide conclusions and recommendations. The Comptroller General and CEO of the research center must also certify the report. The Comptroller General and CEO of the research center must certify if the Secretary of Defense provided sufficient information for informed judgments on lifecycle costs for defense acquisition programs. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and budget request for the joint strike fighter development. The budget request for the Department of the Air Force and Navy includes funding for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), also known as the F-35. The committee expressed disappointment that there were no funds allocated for research and development of a second aircraft tire source or an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006. The JSF alternate engine program is working on the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee expressed disappointment in the lack of funding for the development of a second aircraft tire source or an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006. The Under Secretary of Defense testified that the benefits of a second supplier are not worth the financial cost. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Department of Defense's analysis only focused on potential savings for engine acquisition and did not fully examine potential savings from competition in maintenance and operations. The committee agrees with the GAO's observation and believes the JSF alternate engine program should continue until a full analysis is done on potential costs and savings from competition. The committee recommends an increase of $408.0 million to continue the JSF alternate engine program for fiscal year 2007. They also recommend provisions for the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force to obligate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. Additionally, independent analyses of the JSF alternate engine program are required to be conducted by the Secretary of Defense and the Comptroller General, with a report due by March 15, 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 2766 emphasizes the Department's need to modernize and transform the armed forces to confront irregular warfare threats. They supported transformational activities, including authorizing funds for ship construction, joint development of unmanned systems, and the Joint Strike Fighter engine. The report also highlights the importance of developing capabilities for coalition operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee report emphasizes the importance of developing capabilities for coalition operations and the need for modernization in the armed forces. They expressed concerns about the lack of engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program and directed the Secretary of Defense to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts. The committee remains concerned about relying on one engine provider and authorized additional funds for the development of the interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee report emphasized the need for modernization in the armed forces and directed the Secretary of Defense to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts for the Joint Strike Fighter program. They authorized additional funds for the development of the interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007, adding $400.8 million. The report discussed provisions for the continued development and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems throughout the aircraft's life cycle. In 2008, Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines for F\u201314, F\u201315, and F\u201316 aircraft. This led to improved performance, reduced risk, and over $4.0 billion in cost savings. Congress has consistently supported engine competition for the Joint Strike Fighter program for the past 10 years, with total deliveries potentially exceeding 4,000 aircraft worldwide. The committee is concerned about relying on a sole engine supplier for the Joint Strike Fighter program, as it poses operational and financial risks. They believe that a competitive engine strategy could result in significant cost savings over the aircraft's life cycle. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems to generate savings that offset the cost of engine development. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems to generate savings that offset the cost of engine development. The provision would require certification that informed judgments on life cycle costs were made for the two alternatives. Concerns were raised about the termination of the F136 interchangeable engine without accounting for all costs over the aircraft's life cycle. Supporting competitive propulsion systems is believed to reduce operational risk and lead to more affordable life cycle costs. The committee recommends an increase in funding for the development of the F136 interchangeable engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The conferees also recommend an independent cost analysis of the engine program to be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses. An independent cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program is recommended to be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The analysis will compare costs of the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluate potential savings, and assess the impact on the industrial base. The analysis must be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. Funding for both engines' development in fiscal year 2008 is directed to ensure cost savings, competition, increased capabilities, and a strengthened industrial base. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 5631 directs the Department of Defense to fund the continued development of both the F-135 and F-136 engines in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission. An additional $200,000,000 is recommended for the development of the F-136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. An independent cost analysis of the engine program is also required to be conducted by a federally funded research and development center. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 5631 expresses disappointment in the lack of funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 2nd Engine Source in the fiscal year 2007 budget request. The Committee believes it is premature to cancel the second engine source despite budget challenges faced by the Department of Defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expresses disappointment in the lack of funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 2nd Engine Source in the budget request. The Committee believes competition for the engine is critical for cost savings and recommends additional funding for research and development. The Secretary of Defense must ensure annual funding for the development of 2 options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. H.R. 4986 is a revised version of H.R. 1585, which was vetoed in 2007. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the need for competitive funding for the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The JSF propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as a competitive alternative to the F135 engine. The committee recommended increased funding for the competitive propulsion system, with multiple congressional defense committees also supporting this. A report required independent lifecycle cost analysis of the JSF propulsion system, including a competitive engine program. Witnesses from the Department of Defense, Institute for Defense Analyses, and Government Accountability Office testified on their findings at a hearing. The committee received testimony from various organizations on the findings of the JSF propulsion system. Studies showed inconclusive financial benefits but highlighted non-financial advantages of a competitive engine program. The committee recommends increasing funding by $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program. The committee recommends increasing funding by $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program, with $240.0 million allocated specifically for the competitive JSF propulsion system program. Additionally, a provision is recommended to require the Secretary of Defense to develop and procure a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program. The goal is to conduct a competitive propulsion source selection by fiscal year 2012. The committee report on S. 1547 discussed a proposed provision to develop a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The budget request did not include funds for this development, but the committee recommends increasing funding by $480.0 million for the program. The goal is to conduct a competitive propulsion source selection by fiscal year 2012. The committee recommends increasing funding by $480.0 million for the development of a competitive JSF propulsion system, specifically the F136 engine as an alternative to the current F135 engine. Studies on the financial benefits of this program were inconclusive, but non-financial factors like better engine performance and contractor responsiveness should be considered. The committee recommends increasing funding by $480.0 million for the development of a competitive JSF propulsion system, specifically the F136 engine as an alternative to the current F135 engine. Non-financial factors like better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness support continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 emphasized the critical importance of the success of the Department's Joint Strike Fighter program for national defense. The Committee recommends an increase of $200,000,000 for F-35 production enhancements, including outfitting facilities with the latest production line equipment. An additional $480,000,000 is recommended for the development of an alternative engine for the aircraft. Despite the directive to fund both the F-135 and F-136 engines, the Office of the Secretary of Defense disregarded this direction. The Committee directed the Department of Defense to fully fund the F-136 engine development program in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission, emphasizing the importance of having an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Committee expressed disappointment in the Department of Defense for not continuing funding for the engine in the fiscal year 2008 budget request, citing the benefits of engine competition based on past experiences with the F-16 Fighter program. The Committee recommends funding the development of both engines for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to ensure competition and achieve the best value engine at the lowest price. An additional $240 million is recommended for the Navy and Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation accounts. This decision is based on past experiences with the F-16 Fighter program, which showed that engine competition led to better performance, reliability, and cost savings. The House Armed Services report also highlighted the importance of developing a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program. The budget request included funds for F-35 advance procurement but not for a competitive JSF propulsion system. The committee recommended increases for the JSF competitive propulsion system in previous reports. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 requires annual funding for a competitive propulsion system for the JSF. The Department of Defense did not include funds for this purpose in the budget request, disappointing the committee. Witnesses provided an update on the JSF propulsion system cost analysis and the competitive engine program at a hearing on March 11, 2008. $480.0 million authorized for fiscal year 2008 for the competitive engine program. GAO Director testified on potential program savings. USD (AT&L) did not update analysis from previous year. Committee sees competitive propulsion system for JSF as offering long-term savings potential. The committee notes test failures with the F135 engine, causing delays to the F-35 STOVL variant. Despite these setbacks, they believe a competitive JSF propulsion program will lead to improved engine performance. The committee recommends $1.8 billion for the continued development of the competitive propulsion system program. The committee strongly supports continuing the competitive JSF propulsion system program with a recommended increase in funding. They also urge the Department of Defense to include funds for the program in the fiscal year 2010 budget request, in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and advanced procurement for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The committee recommends an increase of $35.0 million in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (APAF) for long lead items for the F-136 engine in order to begin competition with the F-135 engine in 2012. This is in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which directed the Department of Defense to develop a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The budget request includes $1,532.7 million in PE 64800N and $1,524.0 million in PE 64800F for the JSF program. In compliance with the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the committee recommends an increase of $215.0 million for the development of the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. This funding is necessary to ensure fair competition for the propulsion system of the JSF. Congress has previously added $820.0 million to continue funding for the F136 engine, in order to maintain competition with the F135 engine. The committee recommends investing in a program for the F135 and F136 engine programs to drive technology insertion and provide the best performing engines. They suggest using new composite materials in the F135 engine program for cost savings. An increase of $430.0 million is recommended for the development of the F136 engine, and $35.0 million for F135 engine technology development. This is in compliance with the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The FY2009 DOD Appropriations Act (Division C of H.R. 2638 / P.L. 110-329) allocated $430 million for the development of the F-136 engine within the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84) also directed full funding for the F-136 engine development and procurement efforts. The Senate amendment includes increased funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program management reserves. It also prohibits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 until certain certifications are met. The House bill limits obligations for the F-35 RDT&E program to 75 percent until specific certifications are provided. The Under Secretary of Defense certifies that all fiscal year 2010 funds for the F-35 competitive propulsion system have been obligated. The Secretary of Defense submits a report on F/A-18 multiyear procurement costs and the Department submits a 30-year aircraft procurement plan. The budget request for 30 F-35 aircraft is authorized, along with an increase of $430.0 million for continued F136 engine development. The conferees authorize an increase of $430.0 million for continued F136 engine development and $130.0 million for F136 engine procurement. They expect compliance with the direction for the development and procurement of two options for the F-35 propulsion system. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $122 million in Navy aircraft procurement funding for F-35Bs and Cs, and an increase of $5 million in Navy aircraft advance procurement funding. The conferees authorize an increase of $430 million for F136 engine development and $130 million for F136 engine procurement. This includes a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As, an increase of $5 million in Navy aircraft advance procurement funding for the F136 engine, and a net increase of $153.5 million in Navy research and development funding for the F-35 program. The F-35 program sees a net increase of $153.5 million in Air Force research and development funding, with $231.5 million allocated for the F136 alternate engine and a $78 million reduction for \"program excess.\" H.R. 2647 includes provisions like Section 218, limiting the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain conditions are met, and Section 242, which addresses the alternate engine program. Section 242 of H.R. 2647 limits the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until specific conditions are met, including certification from the Under Secretary of Defense and reports to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense is required to include a request for funding for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget and future-years defense program submissions to Congress. This is to ensure the continued development and procurement of the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must request funding for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II annually to ensure its development and procurement. The F-35 program is developing the F136 engine for competitive production. The House report recommends funding for the competitive F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine for the F-35 program. Despite the requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act, the Department of Defense has not allocated sufficient funds for this purpose. The committee is disappointed with the Department of Defense for not including funds for the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth, with development costs increasing by 38 percent since 2002. Engine procurement cost estimates have also increased by 38 to 43 percent between 2005 and 2008 for different F-35 variants. Between December 2005 and December 2008, engine procurement cost estimates for the F-35B have grown approximately 47 percent, attributed to both the F135 engine and the F-35B's lift fan. The F136 engine program has not experienced any cost growth since its inception. The committee is perplexed by the Department's decisions to not include a competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests, given the F135 cost growth and test failures. The committee recommends increasing funding for the competitive F-35 propulsion system program by $463.0 million. Additionally, they suggest an aggregate increase of $140.0 million for the procurement of four F136 engines and related components. The Administration objects to the additional funding for the F-35 program. The Administration strongly opposes the $603 million addition for the alternative engine program in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, citing delays in fielding the capability and unnecessary expenditures. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that risks of a fleet-wide grounding are exaggerated. Additionally, the Administration objects to the limit on overall JSF development funding and the mandate for an alternative engine program. The FY2010 defense authorization bill (S. 1390) includes a provision to limit overall JSF development funding to 75% until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. The bill recommends a net increase in Navy and Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program, with an increase for the F136 alternate engine and a reduction for excess management reserves. Section 211 of S. 1390 focuses on the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2010 defense authorization bill (S. 1390) includes a provision to limit overall JSF development funding to 75% until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. Section 211 of S. 1390 emphasizes the need for continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program, specifically the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The committee recommends obligating sufficient funds for the F136 competitive propulsion system to ensure the system development and demonstration program continues in fiscal year 2010. The committee recommends funding the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in fiscal year 2010 to continue system development and demonstration. Studies show non-financial benefits in developing a competitive engine for the JSF program. The committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II program. Studies have shown significant non-financial benefits, including better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee's recommendation was approved in full-committee markup by a vote of 12-10. The Administration strongly opposes the addition of $438.9 million for the development of an alternative engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). They argue that the current engine is performing well and that the risks associated with a single engine provider are manageable. Additionally, they believe that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program. The Administration objects to the additional funding for an alternative engine program for the F-35 JSF, arguing that the current engine is sufficient. They oppose the limit on overall JSF development funding and would recommend a veto if the final bill disrupts the program. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve research funding for the alternate engine program but later adopted an amendment to remove this funding. The Senate adopted an amendment (S.Amdt. 1627) to remove research and development funding for an alternate engine program in S. 1390. The amendment also prohibits the use of FY2010 funding on the alternate program until the Secretary of Defense certifies its cost effectiveness. S.Amdt. 1767 would have preserved language limiting DOD's obligation of F-35 research funds and restored additional funding for the alternate engine program. The Senate amendment S.Amdt. 1767 preserved funding for the alternate engine program in FY2010, restored cuts to helicopter and F-35 programs, and reduced funding for the HC/MC-130 aircraft program. The amendment also required a certification for the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The certification ensures funding for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in FY2010. Additionally, $282.9 million is allocated for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement, and $78 million is added for management reserves in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The amount authorized for the Air Force's research, development, test, and evaluation is increased by $78 million for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Additionally, $438.9 million is decreased for aircraft procurement for the Air Force, allocated from airlift aircraft for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to ensure continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 aircraft in FY2010. The text of S.Amdt. 1627 aims to limit funding for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in FY2010. It also includes an increase in funding for the procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and F-35 program management reserves. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program funding is restricted for an alternate propulsion system until the Secretary of Defense certifies its cost-effectiveness and operational benefits. Additionally, an increase in funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement is allocated. The Navy's procurement budget is increased by $282.9 million, with a portion allocated for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. Funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program is also increased, with management reserves being restored. Additionally, offsets include a decrease in funding for the Navy's F136 development. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) decreased funding for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter F136 development by $219.45 million each. The bill was signed into law on December 19, 2009, as P.L. 111-118. The explanatory statement for H.R. 3326 allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additionally, Air Force and Navy research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program saw increases, with concerns persisting about the F-35's progress. The explanatory statement for H.R. 3326 allocated funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns persist about the progress of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with cost growth and schedule issues reported by the Joint Estimating Team. Despite this, the Department of Defense insists the program is on track. $6,840,478,000 is provided for the JSF procurement program, designated as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure all 30 aircraft are procured as requested. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to provide findings of the JET and recent studies on the test program and causes of cost growth to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase in funding for the F-35 program, including additional funding for the alternate engine. They oppose terminating programs prematurely and support realistic budgeting matching available funding. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the alternate engine. They oppose premature program terminations and support realistic budgeting. The Committee believes that continuing certain efforts, such as the presidential helicopter and Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine, may yield significant payback. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the alternate engine. The Department's original plan for the F\u201335 propulsion engine was to have two engine variants, but cost growth led to the abandonment of the alternate engine program. Concerns arise over potential technical problems with the engine, as all three variants of the F\u201335 aircraft will now be powered by the same propulsion engine. The lack of competition for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program is also a concern for the Committee, as it could limit cost savings opportunities. The Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the alternate engine. The Department conducted a business case analysis comparing the cost of a sole source engine provider to a dual source strategy, with costs being essentially the same. Despite the investment in the alternate engine program, the Department chose not to fund it. The Committee believes a dual source strategy is the most cost-effective method moving forward and recommends an additional $560,000,000 for the alternate engine program. The Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the alternate engine. A dual source engine strategy is deemed the most cost-effective method going forward, with an additional $560,000,000 allocated for the alternate engine program. The Administration opposes the additional $130 million for production and $430 million for development of the JSF alternate engine, stating it diverts resources from the overall program. The current engine is performing well, and risks with a single provider are manageable. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, a veto is recommended. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for F-35 alternate engine development in the bill presented to the President. The bill includes $485 million for an alternate F-35 engine and limits DOD from spending more than 75% of its F-35 budget until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The bill includes a limitation on the procurement of F-35 Lightning II aircraft, stating that not more than 30 aircraft can be procured unless certain certifications are received by January 15, 2011, and a 15-day period has elapsed. This includes the obligation of alternate engine funds as a criteria before acquiring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The bill requires certifications by January 15, 2011, including the availability of six F136 engines for testing and completion of 1,000 test hours in the F136 system development program. It also mandates the inclusion of alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The bill mandates funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual defense budget. The bill requires funding in the defense budget for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The bill mandates funding in the defense budget for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, designating the F135 and F136 engine programs as major subprograms for increased oversight. The bill requires funding in the defense budget for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, designating the F135 and F136 engine programs for increased oversight under the Milestone B decision as the original baseline. The bill mandates funding for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, designating the F135 and F136 engine programs for increased oversight under the Milestone B decision as the original baseline. Actions taken in accordance with this designation shall meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, for a major subprogram, unless programmatic changes cause significant cost growth. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program. The budget request contains funds for development of the F-35 aircraft but not for a competitive propulsion system. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. Congress has appropriated funds for the competitive propulsion system despite previous recommendations for increases. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not included funds for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. Cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines have been noted, with the F135 engine development cost now estimated at $7.3 billion, a 50 percent increase over the original contract award. The negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan was 21 percent higher than the budget estimate for the fiscal year 2009 F135 engine contract. The negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan in the fiscal year 2009 F135 engine contract was 21 percent higher than the budget estimate. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review of the F135 cost structure due to cost increases, with the Joint Assessment Team concluding that improvement plans were credible but challenging. An additional investment by the contractor for cost reduction initiatives was deemed necessary. The Deputy Secretary of Defense submitted an update on the competitive engine program, stating that $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M for the F-35 engines. They believe that a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor failed to meet promised expectations over the past year. The F-35 program faced cost and schedule performance issues, leading to reviews by the Department of Defense. The Joint Estimating Team (JET 2) estimated a $3.0 billion cost increase and a 30-month delay in development. The independent manufacturing review team (IMRT) found high production risks. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense plans to procure an additional test aircraft, set up a software simulation facility, and adjust production based on IMRT recommendations. The F-35 program is facing cost and schedule issues, with a projected delay of 13 months and an additional cost of $2.8 billion. The Secretary of the Air Force informed the committee about exceeding unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent. The program is described as having unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite findings and concurrency challenges, the Department aims to request 550 aircraft before completing testing. The committee expresses concerns about the F-35 program, noting significant risks and impacts from required design changes. They recommend reducing the production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete and suggest authorizing 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to certain milestones being met. The committee recommends a provision requiring certification of certain milestones for the procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft before funds can be obligated. The Administration objects to adding $485 million for the extra engine program and associated provisions limiting JSF development funding. The Department does not believe that the $2.4 billion investment in an extra engine for the JSF program will ever be recovered or should be diverted from important defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. A certification requirement is recommended before spending additional funds on the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that developing the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs, improve fleet readiness, and not disrupt the program or result in fewer aircraft procurement. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the alternate engine or the F-35 program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding H.R. 6523, amending the House language to designate an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate the program within 30 days and use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense may restructure the Lightning II aircraft program and F-35 engine program in fiscal year 2010. This restructuring will meet the requirements for designated major subprograms under section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, as long as certain conditions are met. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, with funds added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version had no funds for the program, but commented favorably on it. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. The House approved an amendment to eliminate this funding, and the FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act signed into law provided no funds for the program. Congress's interest in the F-35 alternate engine program may have been influenced by the historical \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney. Congress's interest in establishing and funding an F-35 alternate engine program may have been informed by the historical \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric. This competition stemmed from Air Force frustrations in the 1970s with Pratt & Whitney's management of the F100 engine for the F-15 fighter, leading to concerns about using a single type of engine for their fighter fleet. Congress provided funding for General Electric to develop the F110 engine as an alternate option for the F-16, investing significant amounts in both the F110 and F100 engines to enhance competition. The F-16 engine competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric led to significant investments in engine development. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to improve contractor responsiveness. Benefits included better contract terms, warranties, and early engine improvements. The Great Engine War led to improvements in engine development and contract terms. The Air Force demanded cost projections for six years, leading to firm-fixed price contracts from the first production lot. Contractors agreed to provide future cost projections for the first time to avoid disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The DOD required contractors to provide dual sources of critical parts to avoid disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the program's schedules. The GE Rolls-Royce FET terminated the self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program, despite being almost 80 percent complete. The program had been ongoing for 15 years and had received high marks from the Department of Defense. GE and Rolls-Royce had been advocates for defense acquisition reform and had offered fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines. GE and Rolls-Royce offered fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines for the JSF program, expressing gratitude to Congressional supporters and military experts for their backing of competition in defense acquisition reform."
