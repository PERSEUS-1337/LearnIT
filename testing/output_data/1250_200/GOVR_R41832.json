    "content": "Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite some cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. The country's economic challenges, political instability, and security risks further complicate the situation. Pakistan's troubled economic conditions, precarious political setting, and history of difficult relations with neighbors present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. The country has suffered from Islamist radicalism, with its border region near Afghanistan becoming a haven for insurgents. Pakistan has faced numerous terrorist attacks, with significant civilian and security force casualties. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan strained the U.S.-Pakistan relationship further. The discovery of bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan strained the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, leading to accusations of support for Afghan insurgents. In late November, NATO troops retaliated against Pakistani army outposts, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. The incident sparked fury and led to the scrapping of bilateral agreements related to supply. Following the incident of NATO troops retaliating against Pakistani army outposts, Pakistani officials moved to scrap and renegotiate bilateral agreements with the United States related to supply lines into Afghanistan. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, leading to the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies. Despite efforts to reopen them, the GLOCs remain closed, with negotiations stalling over a proposed fee increase of up to $5,000 per truck. Senior U.S. officials are against a fee hike for NATO supply lines into Afghanistan, calling it \"extortion\" and \"price gouging.\" A Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, causing outrage in the U.S. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved docking $1 million from aid funding each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. Bilateral relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been strained, with anti-American sentiments prevalent among Pakistanis. Anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories are prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis, with the United States now being the nation least favored by Pakistanis. Americans also hold increasingly negative views of Pakistan, with the State Department warning of high travel risks and American civilians facing abductions in the country. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan are major concerns for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress towards key goals such as defeating terrorist groups and stabilizing Afghanistan. There are fears of American citizens being recruited by Pakistan-based elements for terrorism, with several most-wanted enemies of the U.S. believed to be residing in Pakistan. Several most-wanted enemies of the United States, including Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, Taliban chief Mullah Omar, and Haqqani Network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, are believed to reside in Pakistan. American intelligence officials suspect Zawahiri may be receiving protection from elements of the Pakistani government. Congress is questioning the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with some calling for the curtailment of U.S. foreign assistance. Legislation to place new conditions on aid and military reimbursements is moving through Congress. Pakistan received about $2 billion in direct aid from the U.S. in FY2012, making it one of the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. warns that restrictions on aid could be counterproductive. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States warns that restrictions on U.S. aid could be counterproductive to restoring cooperation and trust. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan has not been as catastrophic as expected, leading Islamabad to be increasingly isolated diplomatically. The civilian government's negotiating strategy risks losing billions in foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urges Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a peaceful future for the region. The United States will continue to press Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a peaceful future for the region and insist on neutralizing terrorist safe havens. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta acknowledged Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasized the necessity of maintaining a relationship. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and conditioned military aid on progress in combating militancy and promoting democratic institutions. In July 2011, the US suspended up to $800 million in planned security assistance. In July 2011, the US suspended up to $800 million in planned security assistance to Pakistan due to concerns about its cooperation in combating militancy. Bilateral disagreements have also led to $1 billion in approved reimbursements remaining undisbursed. Analysts suggest that Pakistan's behavior is unlikely to change without strong support for its civilian authorities to reduce conflict within the country and with its neighbors. Analysts advocate strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian government to reduce internal and external conflicts. Despite the need for a robust civilian government, Pakistan's leaders have not effectively addressed security policies or extremism. They often blame the United States while ignoring their own support for Islamist militancy, including aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. This support continues to some extent today. President Obama's decision to visit India in 2010 without stopping in Pakistan raised concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington. The Administration's policies towards India, including refraining from engagement in the Kashmir dispute and supporting U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation without a similar offer to Pakistan, are viewed suspiciously by Pakistani leaders. Afghanistan's closer ties with India and the U.S. in 2011 and 2012 are seen as threats to Pakistan's security by some within the country's security institutions. Pakistan's security institutions fear external threats and foresee a shift towards a more transactional relationship with the U.S. in 2012 and beyond, marked by formal, business-like engagement and new restrictions on foreign assistance. This change follows the tumultuous events of 2011, including the Salala incident, signaling the end of the \"post-9/11 period\" of bilateral relations. The U.S. is considering new restrictions on foreign assistance to Pakistan, with analysts suggesting a more transactional relationship. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlined prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident and halting drone strikes. Former U.S. diplomats advise a more normal, constructive relationship with reduced expectations and better-targeted economic aid programs. The U.S. is advised to forge a more normal and constructive relationship with Pakistan by reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering business ties, and offering discreet support for initiatives promoting regional stability. Analysts caution against a purely security-oriented approach that could fuel anti-American sentiment and restore credibility to the Pakistani military. Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and insistence on an apology for Salala in May 2012 may have been a missed opportunity. Pakistan's May 2012 intransigence on GLOCs and insistence on an apology for Salala may prove costly and a missed opportunity to cooperate with the U.S. Some analysts urge firm pressure on Islamabad for counterterrorism, while others see Pakistan's stance as a catastrophic mistake. Calls for a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan have been made, including targeted sanctions and cutting military aid. Some suggest considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States. Some analysts advocate for targeted sanctions and cutting military aid to Pakistan, with suggestions to consider them an enemy of the United States in the context of Afghanistan policy. Others argue against a more adversarial approach, warning it could jeopardize the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan and strengthen conservative Islamist elements in Pakistan. The observer suggests a \"passive\" U.S. approach towards Pakistan, focusing on security assurances and bolstering civilian governance. The Pakistani military's stance on relations with India and Afghanistan could impact its geostrategic status. Analysts propose prioritizing energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan to enhance Pakistan's security and stability. Pakistan's pursuit of strategic depth in Afghanistan and the status of Kashmir are key issues. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer highlighted the challenges faced by liberal forces in the country. The killing was condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Additionally, Minister Shabaz Bhatti was ambushed by gunmen, further illustrating the security threats in Pakistan. The assassination of Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti, Pakistan's only Christian federal cabinet member, by gunmen on March 2, 2011, was condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Bhatti, a campaigner for religious tolerance and blasphemy law reform, was mourned by Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani and President Zardari. The killings of Bhatti and Governor Salman Taseer were seen as evidence of increasing Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. The shooting incident involving American CIA contractor Raymond Davis in Pakistan in January 2011 caused a diplomatic controversy between the US and Pakistan. Davis, initially claimed to be a diplomat, shot and killed two men in Lahore, leading to accusations of murder by Pakistani authorities. The US government's admission of Davis's true identity as a CIA contractor escalated tensions, with some in Congress suggesting a reduction in aid to Pakistan. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions and express condolences for the loss of life. Chairman Senator Kerry traveled to Islamabad to reduce tensions and express condolences for the loss of life. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Raymond Davis's release, who was freed after a pledge of $2.3 million in blood money. There were denials of any quid pro quo arrangement. Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism, leading to calls to reduce U.S. assistance. There were questions about Pakistan's role in harboring bin Laden, with concerns about complicity or incompetence within the country's military and intelligence services. Pakistan's credibility suffered a blow as it faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid on its territory. Pakistan's military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid deep inside Pakistani territory and for incompetence in locating Osama bin Laden. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, leading to a strong condemnation from Parliament and threats to close vital supply lines for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Bilateral distrust and anti-American sentiments rose, with calls for greater oversight of U.S. assistance to Pakistan. Allegations of ignorance and calls for greater oversight and accountability for U.S. assistance to Pakistan were made, while some senior Members advocated for more engagement with Pakistan. Despite concerns and distrust, the U.S. continued to engage with Pakistan. President Obama and top officials maintained a positive stance, but questions arose over bin Laden's refuge. The U.S. government had no conclusive evidence of official Pakistani knowledge of bin Laden's whereabouts. Senior Administration officials were divided on the future of the relationship, with some advocating for strong reprisals. On May 22, 2011, militants stormed Pakistan's naval base, Mehran. On May 22, 2011, heavily armed militants attacked Pakistan's naval base, Mehran Naval Station near Karachi, killing ten security personnel and four militants. The militants, believed to have inside help, destroyed two U.S.-supplied P-3C Orion aircraft. This attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban as revenge for bin Laden's killing, raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. The attackers at Mehran Naval Station had inside help, leading to the arrest of a former navy commando. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence. ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who linked the attack to Al Qaeda cells within the navy. An inquiry into Shahzad's death began in June, with U.S. officials suggesting senior ISI officials were involved. A closed government inquiry into journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad's death suggested senior ISI officials directed the attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen claimed the killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. An official Commission of Inquiry in January 2012 was unable to identify the culprits, recommending more accountability for intelligence agencies. In July 2011, the Obama Administration made changes in security-related aid policy towards Pakistan, reducing scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment. The Obama Administration reduced scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment aid to Pakistan due to decreased U.S. military presence and visa delays. This move was seen as a warning to Islamabad about potential aid cuts. Pakistani military downplayed the impact and suggested redirecting security assistance to development projects. Some observers believed this decision could lead to more resentment than cooperation from Pakistani leaders. In October 2011, a high-profile op-ed by Mansoor Ijaz referenced a memo allegedly dictated to him by the Pakistani Ambassador, requesting US help to prevent a military coup and install friendly leaders. The \"Memogate\" scandal led to Haqqani losing his job and put pressure on President Zardari. Both deny involvement. The \"Memogate\" scandal involving the authorship of a memo led to Haqqani losing his job and pressure on President Zardari. Despite denials of involvement, concerns of a civil-military clash arose, with rumors of a potential military coup. The investigation lacked evidence of wrongdoing by civilians, and Haqqani was allowed to leave Pakistan. The army and intelligence officers submitted statements to the Supreme Court confirming the memo's authenticity, prompting a warning from Prime Minister Gilani against conspiracies to overthrow the government. Despite rumors, the army publicly pledged support for democracy, with Gen. Kayani dismissing coup speculations as \"speculation.\" In December, rumors of a potential military coup in Pakistan were dismissed by Gen. Kayani, who pledged army support for democracy. The civilian government was upset over the army and intelligence chiefs bypassing them in engaging the court. Despite concerns about the government's stability, the public is against military rule, and opposition politicians are not seeking military intervention. With an assertive judiciary and watchdog media, the likelihood of a military coup is low. Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy in January, leading to a resolution calling for all institutions to stay within their constitutional limits. The crisis atmosphere faded as Prime Minister Gilani softened his criticisms of the military. In the early hours of November 26, 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border mistakenly attacked two small Pakistan army outposts, resulting in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of Pakistan's sovereignty and a violation of international law, sparking anger and accusations against NATO forces. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks on Pakistani soldiers near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law. Pakistani anger led to the closure of NATO logistics routes, eviction of U.S. personnel, and boycott of a conference on Afghanistan. The supply routes have been closed for over five months, with Pakistan demanding a formal apology from the U.S. despite their expressions of regret. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, but Pakistan refused to participate in the investigation. The NATO investigation into the incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border found no improper actions by NATO personnel, but acknowledged serious miscommunication and poor coordination. Pakistan's military criticized the blame placed on them as unjustified and released a document detailing their perspective. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident, believing it could help reopen dialogue. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the Salala incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, but the plan was aborted after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. The idea of apologizing was further discouraged after coordinated insurgent attacks in Afghanistan were blamed on the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network. U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained when the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing on Baluchistan, with at least one witness calling for the partition of Pakistan into substates. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing on Baluchistan, a province in Pakistan with a violent separatist conflict. A resolution was introduced to support the right to self-determination for the people of Baluchistan, causing backlash from the Islamabad government and Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, leading to strained relations between the US and Pakistan. The Salala incident further worsened relations, prompting Pakistan to freeze engagement with the US for a review by its Parliament. The review of engagement with the US by Pakistan's Parliament was delayed until April 2012. Some saw it as a sign of assertiveness by the civilian government, while others viewed it as a facade for army policy. The 14-point guidelines issued included demands to stop drone attacks, infiltration, and use of Pakistani territory for transporting arms to Afghanistan. Pakistan also demanded an apology for a NATO/ISAF attack. The Pakistani Parliament demanded an apology from the United States for a breach of international law and violation of sovereignty. They called for those responsible for the incident to be brought to justice and prohibited any agreements allowing foreign bases or operations in Pakistan. The review also suggested a civil nuclear deal similar to India's offer in 2005. Despite ongoing drone strikes, the Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani democracy and sovereignty. U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad in April. Despite ongoing drone strikes, U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman's visit to Islamabad in late April did not lead to a breakthrough in the strained relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Pakistan's demand for an end to drone strikes, including \"signature strikes\" targeting low-level militants, remains a major point of contention. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to strike high-value targets is a significant obstacle to resolving the issue. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes are halted. Pakistan may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines to Afghanistan via Karachi port until drone strikes are stopped. The main sticking point is Pakistan's demand for an unconditional apology for the deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. The U.S. is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements pending an agreement. Pakistan insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations. President Zardari attended a NATO summit in Chicago focused on Afghanistan's future engagement. President Zardari attended the NATO summit in Chicago amid U.S.-Pakistan tensions and unresolved GLOCs issue. President Obama reportedly snubbed Zardari, causing embarrassment for Pakistan. Despite criticism, Foreign Minister Khar defended Pakistan's participation, emphasizing national interests. Urdu-language editorials praised Zardari for standing up to international pressure. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous\" and stating that Afridi should be praised, not punished. The conviction of Shakil Afridi in Pakistan for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound has sparked outrage in the United States. Some question the conviction due to lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The US Administration's assessment in March 2011 noted limited progress in key objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan, except for advancements in combating Al Qaeda. The last quarter of 2010 showed no progress in effectively executing the COIN cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA. There was a lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning to complement clearing operations, hindering the defeat of the insurgency in Pakistan. Despite this, Secretary Clinton certified in March 2011 that Pakistan was making significant efforts to combat terrorist groups and had made progress in ceasing support to extremists and dismantling terrorist bases. In March 2011, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's efforts in combating terrorist groups and dismantling bases, despite skepticism and political considerations. No similar certification was issued for FY2012. The Administration's assessment in September 2011 showed little progress in enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan. Indicators and metrics related to enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan remained static. Pakistan's COIN capabilities showed a decline due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International efforts to stabilize Pakistan faced challenges with limited progress in funding. The Pentagon's report highlighted positive trends in Afghanistan but emphasized the critical threat posed by the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan. The Pentagon's report emphasized the critical threat posed by the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan remains volatile, with Kabul facing persistent security threats planned and controlled from Pakistan. Pakistan's actions, including selective counterinsurgency operations and provision of insurgent safe havens, undermine security in Afghanistan and strain U.S.-Pakistan relations. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and U.S. citizens working for the ISI. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. High-level interactions continue, with a notable lapse in late 2011/early 2012. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad. In a major show of diplomatic force, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad, accompanied by CIA Director David Petraeus and other senior officials. The U.S. emphasized its stance on militant safe havens in western Pakistan and the need for action if Pakistan does not address the issue. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement continues at other levels, with discussions on crucial areas like counterterrorism and Afghanistan. In March, Amb. Grossman met with President Zardari in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, emphasizing the desire for an honest and mutually beneficial relationship with Pakistan. President Obama also reiterated the importance of counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul. Additionally, senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held talks to discuss border issues. In April, U.S. officials continued efforts to improve relations with Pakistan through various meetings. Gen. James Mattis and Gen. John Allen discussed border coordination with Gen. Kayani in Rawalpindi. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar to build upon previous conversations. USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to express commitment to civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman and Foreign Secretary Jilani had no breakthroughs on major disagreements during the 6th Trilateral Core Group meeting. The U.S. and Pakistan had no breakthroughs on major disagreements during their meetings. The U.S. focused on reopening GLOCs while Pakistan opposed further drone strikes. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi. Drone strikes in western Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants. President Obama personally approves the targeting \"kill list\" for these strikes. The missile strikes in western Pakistan have been effective against Al Qaeda and other militants, but are criticized for killing civilians and violating Pakistani sovereignty. Despite official protests, Pakistan is believed to tacitly allow the strikes and provide intelligence for them. Domestic debate exists on the tactic, with some analysts supporting it as necessary. The drone campaign in Pakistan is seen as effective against Al Qaeda and its allies, with some officials supporting it as necessary. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with concerns about aggravating the already troubled relationship with Pakistan. A mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA campaign while making some changes. The mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign in Pakistan, with changes including greater State Department involvement in strike decisions and advanced notice to Pakistani officials. President Obama defended the program, claiming minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating hundreds of civilian deaths. The CIA drone campaign in Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of 145-535 civilians, including children. Despite targeting militants and their commanders, violence in western Pakistan continues. The U.S. government may have no better option than to continue using this tactic due to the upcoming drawdown of NATO troops in Afghanistan. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) dates back to the 1980s, but mutual mistrust and concerns about the ISI's activities have persisted. The agency is implicated in extralegal abductions, manipulation of domestic politics, and using Islamist militant proxies to further Pakistan's interests. The ISI, under direct army control, is led by Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, seen as deputy to the Chief of Army Staff. He is considered more open and moderate than his predecessors. U.S. officials accuse the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, allowing them to sustain their insurgency. Reports suggest increased ISI-Taliban contacts, with the ISI encouraging violence and supplying explosives. The ISI is accused of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, including supplying them with new high-powered explosives from Pakistan. A leaked NATO report suggests that the ISI manipulates Taliban leaders and maintains regular contact with them, advising on strategy. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton has expressed concerns about certain elements of the Pakistani government being ambivalent towards cracking down on terrorism. Secretary of State Clinton expressed concerns about elements of the Pakistani government being ambivalent towards cracking down on terrorism, citing relationships between terrorist groups and the military. Independent observers believe Pakistan's security services are increasingly infiltrated by Islamist extremists, with leaked cables suggesting biased training of military officers. Analysts suggest a division within Pakistan's security services, with one group led by Gen. Kayani being nationalist and the other driven by a revisionist Islamist ideology. Relations between the CIA and ISI were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident. The Raymond Davis incident strained CIA-ISI relations further, leading to increased Pakistani scrutiny of U.S. security officials and contractors. The circumstances surrounding Osama bin Laden's death highlighted alleged ISI links to Islamist extremism, prompting Pakistan to crack down on citizens working with the CIA. Pressure mounted for American investigators to access bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. After Osama bin Laden's death, the CIA's Islamabad station chief was named by a Pakistani newspaper, believed to be deliberate by U.S. officials to show ISI's leverage. The ISI faced accusations of collusion with Afghan insurgents, including instances where targets were tipped off before raids. The Pakistani military denied these claims, stating some intelligence provided was incorrect. U.S. officials continued to accuse militants of being tipped off before raids. The Pakistani military denied accusations of collusion with Afghan insurgents, stating that some intelligence provided was incorrect. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued with the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi. Pakistan also made efforts to mend relations with the U.S. by granting visas to CIA officers and targeting key terrorists in drone strikes. In South Waziristan, a strike targeted militants, while the deputy of the new Al Qaeda chief, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, was killed in North Waziristan. Pakistan arrested three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation, focusing on Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban,\" continued despite strained government relations. The CIA has reportedly built a network of allies in Pakistan to counter unreliable army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders aim for strategic depth with Central Asia and Afghanistan for leverage against India. President-General Zia ul-Haq supported Afghan mujahideen fighters in the past. Pakistan's pursuit of \"strategic depth\" with Afghanistan has historical roots in supporting Afghan mujahideen fighters against Soviet invaders and later backing the Afghan Taliban regime. The Durand Line, dividing Pashtun tribes, remains a point of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their ongoing acrimony hinders American interests. There is little agreement between the U.S. and Pakistan on Afghanistan's future, with Pakistan seeking a post-NATO Afghanistan aligned with Islamabad. Pakistan seeks a post-NATO Afghanistan aligned with Islamabad, aiming for a dependent Kabul government that aligns with Pakistani interests. The US-led coalition aims for an independent Afghanistan, potentially leading to increased cooperation between Kabul and India. Tensions arise as the US wants to \"fight, talk, build\" while Pakistan takes a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for Americans to leave\" approach in Afghan reconciliation talks. Pakistan's use of proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network may increase its leverage in shaping the reconciliation process. Pakistani officials are confused by U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Some believe Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving them in peace talks with insurgent groups they have supported. U.S. officials stress the need for Pakistani cooperation for long-term stability in Afghanistan, despite troubled relations with Kabul and safe havens for insurgents in Pakistani cities. The Taliban's resurgence in mid-2000s was possible due to sanctuaries in Pakistani cities and tribal agencies. Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan, leading to wariness of Pakistani influence. Islamabad uses Pashtun jihadi proxies to exert dominance over Afghanistan. Concerns arise over U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and potential abandonment of the region, similar to the 1990s. President Obama's 2011 announcement of a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan signaled a focus on an exit strategy, raising concerns about long-term commitment to stabilizing the region. Pakistani leaders emphasize Afghan stability as vital, with efforts to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission and accelerate the peace process. Prime Minister Gilani's criticism of America's \"imperial designs\" and push for Kabul to move closer to Islamabad and seek support from China were met with unease by American observers. In June 2011, the new Joint Commission between Kabul and Islamabad expressed commitment to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process. However, tensions rose in the summer of 2011 due to increased \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, leading to accusations and cross-border attacks between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations deteriorated further in September. In September 2011, Afghan-Pakistani relations worsened after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul. Afghan officials accused the ISI of involvement, leading to tensions between the two countries. Pakistan denied any role in the assassination but Afghan President continued to criticize Pakistan for supporting terrorism. Additionally, Afghan intelligence claimed to have thwarted a plot to assassinate Karzai, with the alleged culprits based in FATA and linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network. Pakistan supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, emphasizing that Kabul should lead the process. Pakistan plays a crucial role in Afghan peace talks, aiming to limit India's influence. They have controlled which Taliban figures can negotiate, including orchestrating the arrest of a key Taliban commander in 2010. Pakistan's efforts to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network have raised concerns about their motives. Pakistan has significant influence over top Afghan insurgents and has controlled which Taliban figures can negotiate for peace talks. There were secret meetings facilitated by NATO between Afghan government officials and QST figures from Pakistan, indicating Islamabad's efforts to shape a settlement in post-conflict Kabul. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan and Afghan President Karzai have expressed concerns about Pakistan's reluctance to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks. However, by early 2012, Islamabad seemed to be allowing the U.S.-Taliban negotiating initiative to proceed. In early 2012, the Islamabad government seemed to be allowing the U.S.-Taliban negotiating initiative to proceed. Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations, which was initially deemed unrealistic. However, Prime Minister Gilani later appealed to the Afghan Taliban for participation in reconciliation and peace talks. There are concerns about Pakistan's ties with Afghan insurgent groups and suspicions of a hasty U.S. exit strategy from Afghanistan. The Haqqani network in the FATA region is considered the most dangerous insurgent group. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is seen as the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group. They have close ties with al-Qaeda and are considered a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. security interests. Despite U.S. requests, Pakistan has not taken action against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, citing stretched military resources and a historical relationship with the group. Many experts believe sustained military offensives are necessary to deal with the Haqqani Network beyond 2012. The Haqqani Network's close ties with al-Qaeda and their high-profile attacks in Afghanistan have strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. Pakistan's inaction against the Haqqanis is rooted in their belief that the group can help exert Pashtun-based influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The September 13, 2011, attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul marked a turning point in relations, showcasing the insurgents' ability to strike in heavily fortified areas. The Haqqani Network's attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions. Secretary Panetta issued an ultimatum to Pakistan to protect U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Mullen accused ISI of supporting Haqqani operatives, leading to increased pressure on Pakistan. The Haqqani Network, supported by Pakistan's ISI, was responsible for multiple attacks including the truck bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. The U.S. called for increased pressure on Pakistan to address this issue. President Obama expressed concerns about the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to take action. This marked a turning point in Secretary Clinton's stance on the matter. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis, leading to increased pressure on Pakistan to address the issue. Pakistani officials denied supporting the Haqqanis and warned of damaging the bilateral relationship with the US. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults against Pakistan, highlighting the challenge of reconciling the Haqqanis with the Kabul government due to their links with Al Qaeda. The Haqqanis' close links with Al Qaeda have hindered reconciliation with the Kabul government. Pakistan, with influence over the Haqqanis, is seen as key to pushing them towards negotiations. Some Pakistani officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the table to avoid military conflict. However, involving the insurgent group in talks would give Islamabad a central role, which some in Washington oppose. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under US law. The potential decision on designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration with the Administration's delay in the formal review on the FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer with commercial uses as a chemical explosives precursor. The use of Ammonium nitrate (AN) as a chemical explosives precursor has increased in Afghanistan, with most illicit AN believed to come from neighboring Pakistan. Despite historic peaks in total IED events in 2011, improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. Legislation in 2012 required a coordinated strategy to counter IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the U.S. urging Islamabad to restrict access to AN. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or to enhance law enforcement efforts to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. Efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives, with Operation Global Shield combating illicit cross-border trafficking of AN. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, Interpol, and Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, have implemented successful measures to address the use of Ammonium Nitrate (AN) in explosives. Recommendations include adding urea fertilizer granules to AN, using colored dyes or RFID tags for tracking shipments. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN access, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The U.S. government is working with Pakistani agencies through the National Counter-IED Forum to develop an action plan. The United States has relied on Pakistani police and border authorities due to the absence of an outright ban. NATO's supply routes through Pakistan have been closed for six months, leading to attacks on transport trucks and drivers. Insurgents have targeted supply lines near the Khyber Pass and Quetta, resulting in destruction and casualties. The closure of NATO's supply routes through Pakistan has led to attacks on transport trucks and drivers, resulting in destruction and casualties. Efforts to find alternative routes, such as the Northern Distribution Network, have been successful in carrying over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. Despite the preference for Pakistan as a faster and cheaper logistics route, the U.S. military has expanded aerial and NDN routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan. Loss of the Pakistani GLOCs has been less damaging to Afghan operations than expected. The closure of NATO's supply routes through Pakistan has led to attacks on transport trucks and drivers, resulting in destruction and casualties. Efforts to find alternative routes, such as the Northern Distribution Network, have been successful in carrying over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. Despite the preference for Pakistan as a faster and cheaper logistics route, the U.S. military has expanded aerial and NDN routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan. Loss of the Pakistani GLOCs has been less damaging to Afghan operations than expected. Gen. Allen mentioned that closure of the GLOCs has not negatively affected the campaign, but the Pentagon's report called it a strategic concern that has hampered Afghan security forces by backlogging equipment. NATO will need to remove at least 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion in withdrawing from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders are insistent on reopening Pakistani GLOCs as the spring fighting season approaches. In early 2012, U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs worth at least $30 billion as the spring \"fighting season\" in Afghanistan approached. Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent, but negotiations stalled over a proposed fee increase from $1,500-1,800 to $5,000 per truck. This drastic price hike was difficult for the Pentagon to accept, as the use of Pakistani GLOCs was previously considered \"free\" in exchange for billions of dollars in CSF reimbursements. Negotiations over the $5,000 fee for Pakistani GLOCs have not been resolved. Pakistan faces challenges from Islamist extremism, militancy, separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third globally in both attacks and deaths. Suicide bombings have increased significantly in the country. Suicide bombings in Pakistan have increased significantly, with the country accounting for nearly half of all suicide bombing deaths worldwide. The drop in Islamist attacks in 2011 was attributed to Pakistani military operations, U.S. drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. However, concerns remain about Al Qaeda operating in Pakistan. Islamist militant groups in the country have become more intermingled and mutually supportive since 2009. The Pakistani Taliban, Quetta Shura Taliban, Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e-Taiba are prominent militant groups in Pakistan. The LeT, with ties to the ISI, is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The Raymond Davis affair revealed U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT. Analysts consider the LeT the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The LeT in Pakistan is identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with an expanding infrastructure. Pakistan's Ambassador criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology. The military dictators encouraged anti-Western sentiment to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Military offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009 were notable, but U.S. assessments are discouraging. The clearing phase of operations has had some successes, but holding and building phases are challenging due to limited civilian administration capacity. Independent analyses show mixed results in counterinsurgency progress, with no notable militant leaders killed outside of Swat. The Pakistani military has achieved some success in dislodging militants in various regions, with significant air force operations in the FATA. However, sustained progress in counterinsurgency efforts has been limited, with ongoing fighting in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The army has made strides in degrading the capabilities of militant groups like Lashkar-i-Islam, but a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. Notable attacks, such as the overrun of a Frontier Constabulary fort in South Waziristan and a TTP suicide bombing in Bajaur, highlight the ongoing security challenges in the region. The North Waziristan agency is a significant haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move their military into North Waziristan despite U.S. requests, citing the need to consolidate control in other areas. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks the necessary hardware for effective warfare, with the expulsion of U.S. military trainers in 2011 further hindering efforts to enhance their capabilities. The July 2011 ejection of U.S. military trainers has hindered U.S. efforts to bolster Pakistan's COIN capabilities. Pakistan's military operations and political approach splintered the Pakistani Taliban in 2011, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. Internal power struggles within the TTP have caused divisions, with the apparent volatility of TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud leading to feuds with other militant commanders. Pakistani officials have shown openness to negotiations with TTP militants, especially as the U.S. began favoring talks with the Afghan Taliban. In late 2011, Pakistani officials showed openness to negotiations with TTP militants as the U.S. favored talks with the Afghan Taliban. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives began in November. Despite initial denials, negotiations seem to have taken place, possibly continuing. Mullah Omar of the Afghan Taliban reportedly pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators facilitated an intra-militant pact to unify factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. The \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" led by Omar unifies militant factions in Waziristan to focus hostility on Afghanistan. The Haqqanis aim to shift attention away from Pakistan, which concerns the U.S. and other governments. In 2012, the U.S. offered a reward for Hafiz Saeed, causing tension with Pakistan. Prime Minister Gilani criticized the U.S. announcement as a \"negative message\" that would widen the trust deficit between the two countries. Opposition lawmakers also condemned the move, calling it \"ridiculous.\" In April, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. A government inquiry blamed local authorities for the security lapse, which bolstered Pakistani Taliban forces and raised concerns about the state's security apparatus. During a visit to New Delhi in May 2012, Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the government for not doing enough against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are worried about the impunity with which terrorists operate in Pakistan. U.S. officials are concerned about terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan, particularly in Quetta, Karachi, North Waziristan, and Kurram tribal agencies. Groups like the Haqqani Network, LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammed pose significant threats. There are worries about American citizens being recruited for terrorism, highlighted by Faisal Shahzad's attempted bombing in Times Square in 2010. Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, received bomb-making training in western Pakistan and was sentenced to life in prison. In another case, a Pakistani-born American was involved in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, assisted the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group in planning the attack. He interacted with a retired Pakistani major and a former special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. The Indian government sought direct access to Headley for their investigation. The Indian government sought direct access to David Coleman Headley, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda, for their investigation into the Mumbai attack. Headley's extensive interrogation in 2010 revealed official Pakistani involvement in the attack, implicating LeT chief Hafez Saeed and an ISI officer. Headley's testimony strained U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised suspicions of Pakistani support for Islamist militancy. Despite being acquitted of Mumbai attack charges, Headley was found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India has led to three full-scale wars and ongoing military preparedness. The partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmir issue have been major sources of tension. Despite some successes in the Composite Dialogue, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Following the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack that killed 165 civilians, including 6 Americans, the peace process between India and Pakistan stalled. Territorial disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources has also strained bilateral relations. The US has refrained from mediating the Kashmir dispute, while Pakistan accuses India of supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India focused on holding Pakistan accountable for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Despite initial reluctance, peace talks resumed in early 2011, including the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" and discussions on economic cooperation. A positive meeting between foreign secretaries in June 2011 raised hopes for expanded confidence-building measures. The June meeting of foreign secretaries in Islamabad led to increased economic cooperation and confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan. Trade ministers from both countries agreed to liberalize bilateral trade, addressing issues such as high transaction costs and slow deliveries. India also showed support for a proposed EU initiative to waive duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas. The killing of Osama bin Laden had implications for relations between the two countries, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh viewing it as a positive step in the fight against terrorism. Manmohan Singh praised the killing of Osama bin Laden as a significant blow to terrorist groups but expressed concerns about hastened U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi saw the event as an opportunity to press Pakistan for extradition of Mumbai attack perpetrators. Afghan President Karzai's closer ties with India raised Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban may have influenced this decision. Karzai's decision to strengthen ties with India is seen as a provocative move that could complicate efforts to improve relations with Pakistan. Pakistan's offer to grant MFN trade status to India could significantly boost bilateral trade and promote peace between the two countries. Pakistan's offer to move towards freer bilateral trade with India, shifting from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" of prohibited items, indicates a shift in their stance on the Kashmir issue. There have been no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years, and President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. The avalanche tragedy at Siachen Glacier highlighted the futility of conflict over the region, which has negligible military value. The avalanche tragedy in the Siachen Glacier region of Kashmir brought attention to the conflict over the area, which has little military value. Despite efforts to improve relations, both Pakistan and India remain firm in their positions. Plans for a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US, face skepticism due to security concerns in the region. The threat of Islamist militancy from Pakistan continues to hinder meaningful concessions from India. India's cautious optimism is constrained by Islamist militancy from Pakistan. New Delhi is dissatisfied with Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, especially LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. Pakistan's generals play a key role in determining future relations with India. China's close relationship with Pakistan could help prevent open conflict. China has been a key ally of Pakistan since the 1960s, providing arms and economic support. The relationship deepened with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in 2010, leading to various cooperative agreements and investments totaling billions of dollars. China's involvement in Pakistan's economy is significant, with plans to build nuclear reactors despite international guidelines. In 2011, the two countries designated it as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Pakistan responded swiftly in 2011 when China blamed militants trained in Pakistan for terrorist activities in Xinjiang province. In August 2011, Pakistan reacted quickly to China's accusations of Islamist militants trained in Pakistan being involved in terrorist activities in Xinjiang province. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing to address the issue. China expressed concerns in 2012 about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. With deteriorating US-Pakistan ties, Pakistan is increasingly relying on its friendship with China. Pakistani leaders showed closeness with China in 2011, with Prime Minister Gilani's visit resulting in agreements for fighter jets and submarines. China agreed to expedite delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets to Pakistan, along with negotiations for the purchase of six submarines worth up to $3 billion. The United States and China have a shared interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities, despite differing views on India. This could lead to greater coordination between the two countries in areas such as nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's military and diplomatic support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions. As the US deepens its partnership with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is likely to increase. However, China's own interests suggest that its policies towards Pakistan will not solely focus on balancing India. The \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan may no longer guarantee unconditional support. China is unlikely to mediate in any US-Pakistani disputes or replace the US as Pakistan's main foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. The US opposes the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project due to sanctions, but Pakistan remains committed to completing it. Tehran has offered $500 million for construction after a Chinese consortium withdrew. Iran seeks barter deals with Pakistan to bypass sanctions. Pakistan's efforts to skirt international sanctions include seeking barter deals with Iran to trade oil for wheat and rice. US concerns about Pakistan's nuclear security persist due to the country's history of illicit proliferation and the potential for leakage of nuclear know-how. Despite improvements in recent years, analysts warn that parts of the illicit nuclear proliferation network may still be intact. Additionally, Pakistan is reportedly expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to US civil nuclear cooperation with India. Pakistan is rapidly growing its nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to US civil nuclear cooperation with India. China's plan to build two new nuclear reactors in Pakistan raises concerns about violation of Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. The Obama Administration is facing a dilemma over the proposed deal and is seeking Beijing's justification and approval through international fora. Economic challenges such as inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, and corruption are hindering Pakistan's development. Devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011 caused significant economic losses. Corruption and flooding have hindered Pakistan's economic development, leading to a decline in foreign investment. Increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability are also contributing factors. Pakistan's economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, and reviving growth. India's economic growth has surpassed Pakistan's since the early 2000s, with higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. Pakistan's economic struggles have led to seeking multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF, with a current program on hold due to failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns have further delayed disbursement of funds, prompting Pakistan to seek U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. Pakistan is facing challenges in repaying IMF loans due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies have faced obstacles, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages are also contributing to economic deterioration, particularly affecting textile businesses. Electricity shortages in Pakistan are causing economic issues, with textile businesses forced to shut down due to power outages. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent. Despite challenges, Pakistan's economy grew by 2.4% in the fiscal year ending June 2011. Inflation is a major concern for Pakistanis, with 52% citing it as the most important problem. Persistent debt, inflation, and energy shortages are expected to continue hindering growth. Persistent double-digit inflation and severe energy shortages are expected to continue crippling growth in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges structural deficiencies in the economy, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. International financial institutions highlight governance issues and a deteriorated fiscal situation in the country. The 18th Amendment devolved key functions to provincial governments in Pakistan, leading to new challenges. The fiscal situation has deteriorated, governance improvements are lacking, and overall macroeconomic risks remain significant. The World Bank recommends focusing on human development sectors like education and health to prevent the risk of poverty alleviation gains being lost. The IMF warns of poor near- and middle-term prospects due to low growth, high inflation, and a weakening external position. Urgent policy action is needed to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders aspire to address these issues. Pakistani leaders aim to address economic challenges by focusing on reducing power shortages, implementing financial measures to reduce inflation, and improving access to Western markets, particularly for textile exports. The country's democracy has faced struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with a bicameral Parliament holding federal power. The textile sector employs 3.5 million Pakistanis and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs, with efforts to reduce tariffs on textile exports to boost the economy. Pakistan's bicameral Parliament holds federal power with a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate. President Zardari was elected in September 2008. The military still influences foreign and national security policies, while the PPP-led coalition struggles to stay in power and enact reforms. The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" battles the executive branch and pursues corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari. The PPP-led coalition in Pakistan faces challenges from various political parties, including the JUI and MQM, leading to threats to its majority status and government existence. The MQM's withdrawal and rejoining of the coalition multiple times in 2011 posed a risk of government collapse. These actions were seen as attempts to gain more administrative control in Karachi. In May 2011, the PPP strengthened its standing by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction, potentially threatening Nawaz Sharif's PML-Nawaz. The PPP also secured control of the Senate until 2015 through gains in the February 2012 elections, allowing them to block legislation even if they lose in future National Assembly polls. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death were embarrassing for the Pakistani military. The embarrassment of Osama bin Laden's death led to rare domestic criticism of the Pakistani military, creating an opening for civilian leaders to potentially gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Despite media criticism of the security establishment, civilians have not taken advantage of this opportunity, instead rallying behind the security services. Parliament did seat a commission to investigate the circumstances of bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan and American forces penetrating Pakistani territory, but initial lack of focus and cohesion diminished expectations for greater civilian authority. The body's lack of focus and cohesion reduced expectations for greater civilian authority. Civil-military tensions escalated after the bin Laden raid, nearly leading to a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders regarding a corruption case against President Zardari. Despite being found guilty of contempt, Gilani refused to resign, but legal scholars predict he will be disqualified from office after the appeal period ends in June. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan rose as a new political star in Pakistan with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, and the PTI has gained notable converts from major national parties, posing a threat to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's votebank. Imran Khan's rise in late 2011 as a political star in Pakistan with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party poses a threat to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's votebank. Khan has strong support in Punjab and may become a \"kingmaker\" in future governance arrangements. He has made bold promises to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and eradicate corruption within 90 days. Despite skepticism from observers, Khan's popularity reflects the public's desire for honest politicians. Additionally, there are concerns about the resurgence of conservative Islamist political forces in Pakistan under the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) banner. The Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) is a coalition of conservative Islamist political forces in Pakistan opposing cooperation with the US and India. Led by Hafiz Saeed, the group rallies against reopening GLOCs and accuses the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Anti-American sentiment is a political tool in Pakistan, with some analysts suggesting security services support the DPC's rise. The Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) is a coalition of conservative Islamist political forces in Pakistan opposing cooperation with the US and India. Some analysts see Pakistan's security services benefiting from and possibly supporting the DPC's rise as a tool of leverage against both the United States and Pakistan's civilian leaders. The human rights situation in Pakistan is poor, with serious reported abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and lack of government accountability leading to a culture of impunity. The human rights situation in Pakistan is dire, with widespread issues such as arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, corruption, violence against women, child abuse, human trafficking, discrimination against minorities, and lack of worker rights. The human rights situation in Pakistan remains dire, with discrimination based on caste, sexual orientation, gender identity, and HIV status continuing. Violence, abuse, and intolerance by militant organizations contribute to a culture of lawlessness. Pakistan is ranked as the world's most dangerous country for journalists. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about \"disappearances\" and extrajudicial killings by Pakistani security forces. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan, meant to protect Islamic beliefs, are criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrarily enforced. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan have faced criticism for being discriminatory and arbitrarily enforced, leading to calls for repeal from international human rights groups. Despite efforts by some politicians to reform the laws, including the assassination of two government proponents, no significant changes have been made. The US has provided significant financial assistance to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion by the end of 2011. In 2001, Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion by the end of 2011. This included $8.3 billion in development and humanitarian aid, and nearly $7 billion for security-related programs. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 authorized increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and placed conditions on security-related aid. Additionally, a Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund was established to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Congress has also appropriated billions of dollars to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. The U.S. has provided nearly $9 billion in \"coalition support funds\" for counterterrorism operations in Pakistan since 2001. Recent oversight has led to more rejected claims. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report aims to help build a stable Pakistan with $3.5 billion allocated for infrastructure projects. Washington is considering grants for the Diamer Basha dam project led by the Asian Development Bank. The Asian Development Bank is leading a $12 billion project to construct the Diamer Basha dam in Pakistan, which could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity. Concerns about corruption and oversight have delayed the disbursement of aid funds, reinforcing Pakistani doubts about U.S. reliability. Security assistance to Pakistan has been impacted, with arms transfers focused on counterterrorism operations. Major U.S. arms transfers to Pakistan since 2001 have included items useful for counterterrorism operations and conventional warfare. Pakistan has received helicopters, infantry arms, and other equipment under various authorities. U.S.-supplied defense equipment, especially for counterinsurgency operations, was slow to arrive, leading to complaints from Pakistani officials. Security assistance to Pakistan's civilian sector aims to strengthen law enforcement capabilities. The circumstances of OBL's death have influenced the reevaluation of aid programs, leading to reductions, restrictions, and new conditions in the bilateral relationship. The reevaluation of aid levels and the bilateral relationship with Pakistan began in 2011, leading to significant reductions and new restrictions in pending FY2013 legislation. There is a growing recognition that U.S. military aid has not effectively countered Islamist militancy in Pakistan and may hinder its development. Analysts suggest focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen Pakistan's civil society. Major bills for FY2013 contain Pakistan-related provisions, including stricter conditions on aid. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 prohibits preferential procurement from Pakistan until the government reopens ground lines of communication. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to limit payments to Pakistan, withhold funds unless certain conditions are met, and restrict procurement until ground lines of communication to Afghanistan are reopened. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to limit payments to Pakistan, withhold funds unless certain conditions are met, and restrict procurement until ground lines of communication to Afghanistan are reopened. Additionally, the bill includes requirements for the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to report to Congress on the utilization of funds for Pakistan and certification criteria for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to limit payments to Pakistan, withhold funds unless certain conditions are met, and restrict procurement until ground lines of communication to Afghanistan are reopened. The Act also includes requirements for the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to report to Congress on the utilization of funds for Pakistan and certification criteria for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Additionally, the Act limits total State Department aid to Pakistan to about $800 million, with specific allocations for different purposes, and withholds $33 million of appropriated funds unless Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions to limit payments to Pakistan, withhold funds until certain conditions are met, and restrict procurement until ground lines of communication to Afghanistan are reopened. It also requires reports on fund utilization and certification criteria for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Additionally, the Act limits State Department aid to Pakistan to $800 million and withholds $33 million unless Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The bill also includes requirements for a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan with goals, benchmarks, and biannual progress reports. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 5857 to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013. The bill includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met, such as cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and providing humanitarian access. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 5857 to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013. The bill includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met, such as cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and providing humanitarian access. Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to submit a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan with achievable goals, benchmarks for progress, and recommendations to suspend assistance if Pakistan fails to make measurable progress. It also allows for funds to be used for cross-border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central Asian republics. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 5857 to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013. The bill includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met. Funds can be transferred to PCCF and remain available until September 30, 2014 with notification to Congress."
