    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" and involves the modification of a long-term contract regarding the Tongass National Forest. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" modifies a long-term contract for the Tongass National Forest. Definitions include terms like \"board feet\" and \"contracting officer.\" Congress finds the importance of mid-market criteria and proportionality in timber sales. The purchaser is the Ketchikan Pulp Company. The Ketchikan Pulp Company entered into a contract with the Forest Service to harvest timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The contract aims to provide timber for the purchaser's facilities on a long-term basis. The legislation is necessary to support the operation of a pulp mill in southeast Alaska, which will create jobs, utilize low-grade wood, and improve environmental practices. The purchaser plans to invest $200,000,000 in environmental and operational improvements to its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska. This includes converting to a chlorine-free bleaching process, expanding wastewater treatment facilities, and improving power generation equipment. The contract extension for 15 years is crucial for amortizing these projects and sustaining the city's economy and job base. The purchaser aims to maintain a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska by utilizing local workforce, contractors, and suppliers. They also plan to participate in land management planning, adhere to sustainable forest resource principles, and support various forest uses like tourism, fishing, and recreation. The national interest is served by a policy that ensures proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. The contract is modified to extend the term by 15 years and include a plan for timber volume requirements to be harvested in 5-year increments. The changes aim to improve economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. The Forest Service will provide the purchaser with a minimum of 192,500,000 board feet of timber annually until March 1, 1999. The purchaser must be able to harvest this amount each year. The contracting officer must ensure the construction of roads by the purchaser in advance of the 5-year operating period. Timber selected for inclusion must meet mid-market criteria. Appraisals will be performed by the contracting officer using normal independent national forest standards. The contracting officer will perform appraisals and designate rates for timber increments, ensuring rates do not disadvantage the purchaser. Proportionality will be measured based on contiguous management areas, acres, and rotation age. The purchaser can convert or replace its pulp mill with a facility producing value-added products from pulp logs. The contract modification eliminates the unilateral termination clause and allows for further modifications by mutual agreement. The modifications will take effect 45 days after the enactment of the Act, and the contracting officer must revise the contract text accordingly. The contracting officer will make changes to the contract to implement modifications made by subsection (c). Timber volume under the contract will continue as modified, along with additional volume to meet the annual requirement."
