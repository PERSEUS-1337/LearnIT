Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with preference given to states with substantial incidence or prevalence of the diseases. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Funds can be used for developing mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases. Matching funds are required for eligibility. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. States must provide non-Federal contributions of at least 50% of program costs to be eligible for the grant. Contributions can be in cash or in kind. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. States must provide non-Federal contributions of at least 50% of program costs to be eligible for the grant. Contributions can be in cash or in kind. Federal Government assistance cannot be included in determining non-Federal contributions. Grants should supplement, not supplant, State and local funds. The Secretary may waive requirements for a State based on economic conditions. States receiving funds should involve localities in planning mosquito control plans. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. States must involve localities in planning, implementation, and evaluation of community-based mosquito control plans. Grants should ensure that at least 85 percent of the amount received is expended at the local level or for local public health improvement. Technical assistance can be provided to expand the capability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in supporting State and local health departments with mosquito control programs and containment of arboviral diseases. The Secretary, in consultation with health organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs to prevent arboviral diseases. Up to 20% of funds can be used for this purpose. The Director will establish guidelines for building the public health infrastructure, including identifying new cases of disease, tracking disease spread, providing laboratory support, increasing surveillance for arboviruses, conducting educational campaigns, and outlining mosquito control procedures. The Secretary will evaluate the program within 18 months. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act. The report will include the results of the program evaluation, information on developing sustainable mosquito abatement programs for funded States, progress on guidelines implementation, and an overall cost-benefit analysis of the program. The program established under this subsection will be evaluated for overall costs and benefits. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The program will terminate on September 30, 2004, unless extended by the Secretary based on the evaluation. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new Arbovirus Research Program under Part B of title II. The President is mandated to expand research on controlling insect populations that transmit diseases like West Nile Virus, develop screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and methodologies for containing the virus. Activities may involve examining existing and new control methods and can be carried out by various entities including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health. The President is authorized to promote coordination between relevant Federal agencies, private sector, and experts in public health, entomology, arbovirology, and veterinary health. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2003 through 2007."
