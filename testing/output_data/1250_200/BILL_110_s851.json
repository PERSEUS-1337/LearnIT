There are limitations on the credit amount based on the taxpayer's tax liability and other credits claimed. The credit is only allowed for up to 3 eligible students per year and can be claimed for a maximum of 4 taxable years. Limitations on the education tax credit include: not being able to claim the credit for a student for more than 4 prior years, requiring the student to be at least a half-time student for part of the year, and denying the credit for students convicted of a felony drug offense.

Income limits for taxable years after 2008 are set at $70,000 and $140,000. \"Income limits for taxable years after 2008 are increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment.
