The Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2006 mandates training programs for supervisors, including interactive instructor-based training on developing goals and objectives with employees. The Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2006 requires supervisors to engage in various activities such as setting goals, mentoring employees, managing performance, and receiving training on prohibited personnel practices. Experienced supervisors also mentor new supervisors to transfer knowledge and skills. The Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2006 mandates that supervisors participate in mentoring programs where experienced supervisors transfer knowledge in communication, critical thinking, and teamwork to new supervisors. Supervisors must complete these programs within a year of appointment and every three years thereafter. The Office of Personnel Management will oversee agency compliance with these requirements. Management will establish regulations for agency compliance with the Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2006. The Office of Personnel Management will issue regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment and apply to new supervisors appointed after that date. Supervisors employed before the effective date must complete training programs under the Federal Supervisor Training Act every 3 years. SEC. 3. MANAGEMENT COMPETENCY STANDARDS.
