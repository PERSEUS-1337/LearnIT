BOX DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENT PERIOD FOR MINIMUM PAYMENTS ON CREDIT CARD BALANCE. Section 127(b) of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include new requirements for minimum payment terms on credit card balances. This includes clear and conspicuous repayment information in a tabular format, showing the required minimum monthly payment as a dollar figure and percentage of the outstanding balance, along with the estimated number of months to pay off the balance by making only minimum payments. The creditor must disclose the required minimum monthly payments and prohibit further advances or extensions of credit on the account. The applicable annual percentage rate of interest in effect on the disclosure date must be applied, considering different rates for various outstanding balance portions. The creditor must disclose the minimum monthly payments and restrict additional credit advances. The annual percentage rate can be fixed or variable, including introductory rates that may change based on an index or formula. The disclosure must reflect the actual rate in effect for the remainder of the amortization period, excluding temporary or introductory rates. SEC. 4. ADVANCED NOTICE REQUIRED BEFORE INCREASING RATES OR FEES ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. Section 127 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to require advance notice of any increase in interest rates or fees on credit card accounts. Increases in interest rates cannot take effect before the beginning of the billing cycle that starts at least 30 days after the obligor receives a specific notice. The Truth in Lending Act now requires advance notice of any increase in interest rates or fees on credit card accounts. Interest rate increases can only take effect after the obligor receives a specific notice, with a 30-day waiting period. Additionally, no fees can be imposed on the account before the end of the 30-day period after receiving notice of the fee. The Truth in Lending Act mandates advance notice of interest rate or fee increases on credit card accounts.

The notice must explain how, when, and why a fee will be imposed and provide options for addressing it."
