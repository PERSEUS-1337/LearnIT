    "content": "The period since late 2007 has seen tight supplies, strong demand, and high prices for major grains and oilseeds in U.S. and international markets. Prices for wheat and rice surged in early 2008, with wheat prices rising 44% and rice prices more than doubling. This report examines the factors behind the market conditions for agricultural commodities in the 2007/2008 crop year, focusing on U.S. farm program crops and discussing the impact on farm incomes, government programs, hedging activities, food prices, and international food security. The impact of volatile commodity prices on farm incomes, government programs, hedging activities, food prices, and international food security is discussed. Various viewpoints and policy options in response to high commodity prices are also reviewed. High market prices benefit producers but worsen food security for low-income households, especially in import-dependent countries. The global food crisis in 2008 was signaled by appeals from the United Nations for donor countries to provide $755 million to address rising commodity prices. This crisis threatened to push 100 million people in low-income countries into deeper poverty, with 37 countries identified as needing external assistance, particularly in Africa. The WFP's executive director announced a funding gap of $755 million due to rising commodity prices, leading to food price inflation and increased costs for lower-income households, livestock feeders, and food processors. High price volatility has raised risks and costs along the marketing chain, impacting grain merchandising and hedging activities at commodity futures exchanges. This has limited forward contracting opportunities for grain and oilseed producers. High market prices for major U.S. program crops are driven by various factors such as weather-related supply shortfalls, surges in demand, and government policies. Wheat prices are influenced by international crop failures and government export restrictions. Coarse grains and oilseeds see high prices due to growing demand and biofuels policies. Rice prices are affected by export restrictions and panic buying. Cotton prices are high due to a bullish market mentality despite abundant supplies. The global market mentality is a major factor in high commodity prices, impacting supply and demand balance. Lack of investment in agriculture reduces productivity and food supply availability. High prices for one crop affect other crops competing for agricultural land. Government policies and weather events also contribute to high commodity prices. The current farm commodity market conditions for major U.S. crops resemble the 1972-1974 period with high prices and low global stocks. Prices in cash and futures markets have reached historic highs due to record price volatility driven by crop prospects worldwide. The historically high and volatile commodity prices have led to record price volatility in agricultural markets this year. This has raised the cost of doing business unevenly among market participants, impacting U.S. farm income positively but causing concerns for the livestock sector and food processors. Consumers from low-income households and import-dependent nations have also expressed concerns about rising food prices. Commodity prices have risen, causing concerns for low-income consumers and import-dependent nations about food price inflation and agricultural producers meeting demand. Global stocks for major commodities are expected to be at historically low levels, with stocks-to-use ratios reaching record lows. Global rice stocks are projected to be slightly up from the previous year at 77.2 million tons in 2007/2008, with a stocks-to-use ratio of 18.2%. Current rice stock levels have halved since 2000, with pipeline supplies necessary for a continuous grain flow. Market analysts speculate on desirable pipeline levels for wheat, corn, and soybeans, with USDA ending stock projections affecting market prices. The USDA projects tight global coarse grain stocks in 2008/2009, with wheat and rice stocks slightly rebuilding. U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2007/2008 are at their lowest level since 1947, while soybean stocks are projected at the lower end of their range. Corn ending stocks are ample but historically low in global supply-to-use terms, impacted by biofuels mandates. Cotton stands out with abundant global and U.S. ending stocks. In 2008/2009, USDA projects tight global coarse grain stocks, while wheat and rice stocks are expected to slightly rebuild. Ending stocks are calculated as the difference between total supplies and total disappearance, serving as an indicator of price outcomes. Expectations for high stocks relative to use typically result in lower prices, while low stocks tend to raise prices. The tight supply situation has led to higher commodity prices globally. The global tight supply situation in 2008/2009 led to higher commodity prices across the agricultural marketing chain, with different markets responding at varying speeds and levels of volatility. Farm prices are influenced by local conditions and tend to be lowest after harvest, while futures market prices react almost instantly to new information. Wholesale and export market prices fall between farm and futures market prices in terms of responsiveness to changing conditions. Commodity futures exchanges play a crucial role in trading commodity futures contracts for potential physical delivery at a fixed price on a future date. Commodity futures exchanges serve as central exchanges for market information, allowing participants to react quickly to new information by placing buy or sell orders. Futures contract prices adjust rapidly to changes in commodity supply and demand expectations, with market activity reported electronically by major exchanges. These exchanges play critical roles in price discovery and risk management for agricultural commodities, with prices hitting historic highs in the first few months of 2008. Prices for various commodities on commodity futures exchanges hit historic all-time highs in 2008, with unprecedented volatility in response to global supply tightening. Corn and rice contracts were particularly active, reaching new highs almost daily. Corn and wheat futures also saw record volatility measures in 2006 and 2007. In 2007 and 2008, corn and wheat prices experienced record volatility, with prices for agricultural commodities continuing to rise. USDA projects record high farm prices for major crops in the 2007/2008 crop year, with tight market conditions expected to persist into 2008/2009. The USDA projects record high farm prices for major crops in the 2008/2009 marketing year, influenced by U.S. and international market conditions. Monthly farm prices reported by USDA show less volatility compared to futures prices on commodity exchanges. Despite setting record highs, concerns arise over the deviation of 2008/2009 prices from previous averages and record season average farm prices. The 2008/2009 farm prices for major crops are projected to be significantly higher than the previous five-year average and previous record highs, causing concern among consumer and hunger advocates. Prices for grains, oilseeds, and cotton are all expected to be well above historical averages. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) predicts that long-run average prices for major crops will remain elevated. The United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reports a significant increase in export prices for agricultural commodities in recent years. The FAO reported a 34% rise in export prices for major agricultural commodities in 2006 and a 23% increase in 2007. Food prices in the international marketplace surged by 18% in the first three months of 2008, driven by higher prices in cereals and oils. Rising food prices are attributed to increasing demand from emerging economies, competition between biofuels and food production, high fuel prices, and climatic shocks. International government policies limiting export supplies and a weak U.S. dollar have also contributed to high commodity prices. The market effects of international government policies limiting export supplies and a weak U.S. dollar have heightened fears of shortage and made U.S. exports more competitive. Global grain production declined in 2005 and 2006 due to decreasing global productivity, leading to reduced exportable supplies. Australia's grain exports were significantly reduced in 2007 due to drought, while other countries also experienced decreased grain crops. The EU had to import substantial volumes of wheat and other feed grains due to declining supplies, shifting from a major net exporter to an importer. The EU switched from being a major grain exporter to a net importer in 2007, leading to a global grain supply shortage. The increasing world population, especially in developing countries like China and India, has raised demand for food, particularly meat and dairy products, driving the need for more grains to feed livestock. Lack of investment in agriculture in developing countries has resulted in slow yield growth, causing global agricultural surplus stocks to decline. The declining value of the U.S. dollar has led to a surge in U.S. exports of agricultural products, with record shipments of bulk commodities. Total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2008 reached a record $101 billion, including record bulk shipments of $44.7 billion and 135.8 million tons. Corn, wheat, sorghum, and rice exports have all seen significant increases. Record exports of grains and oilseeds in the 2007/2008 marketing year have helped draw down U.S. stocks and fuel higher commodity prices. The decline in the U.S. dollar's value has made U.S. grains and oilseeds attractive despite high commodity prices. Governments are encouraging biofuel production due to concerns over high oil prices, energy security, and climate change. Brazil has a significant biofuels program, requiring a minimum use of sugar-cane-based ethanol in its gasoline supply. Brazil, the EU, Thailand, India, China, and the United States have established biofuel mandates to increase the use of biofuels in their fuel supply. The EU focuses on vegetable-oil-based biodiesel production, while the US has extended and expanded its Renewable Fuel Standards. Thailand, India, and China have temporarily suspended their biofuels programs due to high commodity prices and a global food crisis. The Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) mandate increasing biofuel blending with conventional fuels in the U.S. supported by tax credits and import tariffs. Current U.S. biofuel production is mainly corn-based ethanol, with mandates expanding to 36 billion gallons by 2022, putting pressure on crop production systems. The Renewable Fuel Standards mandate increasing biofuel blending with conventional fuels in the U.S., aiming for a total of 36 billion gallons by 2022. This has led to higher corn prices as a significant portion of the crop is used for ethanol production, causing a bidding war for available crop land and driving up prices of other grains like soybeans and wheat. The rise in biofuel production has been a major factor in the global increase in food prices, with most of the additional corn production going towards biofuels in the United States. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) conducted a study on the effects of U.S. biofuels Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) and tax credits on corn and other commodities prices. The study found that implementing the RFS alone would raise corn prices by 19%, while the ethanol tax credit (TC) supports prices by 11%. Joint implementation of both RFS and TC increases corn prices by 20% and significantly impacts soybean oil prices, which are projected to be 73% higher. The effects of biofuels on prices extend beyond the Corn Belt to other regions where wheat, cotton, and other grains are produced. The biofuels price effects extend beyond the Corn Belt to regions where wheat, cotton, and other grains are grown. Studies show that the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) and ethanol tax credits (TC) support corn prices by 20%. The impact is highly dependent on petroleum prices, which can substitute for government incentives. Import tariffs on Brazilian ethanol and grants for the biofuels sector were not considered in the studies. In the U.S., federal biofuels policy impacts the ethanol sector in the short and long run. In the short run, incentives lead to new ethanol plant construction, which will continue producing even without incentives. In the long run, the policy's effects depend on crude oil prices and the number of ethanol plants built. Foreign government responses to high commodity prices reinforce the prices. Foreign government policies in response to high commodity prices have inadvertently reinforced higher prices, worsening market supply-and-demand conditions. Many wheat and rice exporting countries have restricted exports to ensure domestic food availability and control inflation, leading to higher international market prices. The World Food Programme reported that over 40 food-exporting countries had imposed restrictions or bans on crop exports to stabilize prices domestically. Export bans have significantly impacted the global rice market, where only a small percentage of annual production is traded internationally. Since late 2007, traditional rice exporters like Vietnam, India, China, and Egypt, along with minor exporter Cambodia, have implemented policies to limit exports, removing over a third of available supplies from world markets and driving prices higher. Panic buying ensued, with the Philippines aggressively seeking remaining supplies. Similar actions were seen in the wheat market, with countries like Ukraine, Argentina, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan imposing export restrictions to control food price inflation. In 2008, Kazakhstan implemented policies to slow wheat exports due to declining supplies, eventually leading to an outright ban. Argentina also imposed export controls on wheat, beef, corn, and soybeans, resulting in a nationwide farmers' strike and a shift in demand to U.S. suppliers. Argentina's strict export controls have significantly impacted the country's agricultural prospects. In 2008, Argentina's strict export controls led to a decline in planted area for wheat, corn, and soybeans. Several countries removed barriers to imports and lowered tariffs on foodstuffs to meet domestic food needs. This increased international demand while supplies were restricted, and petroleum prices doubled since January 2007. Petroleum prices have doubled since January 2007, reaching a record $130 per barrel by late May 2008. High oil prices have increased operating costs along the marketing chain for agricultural inputs and outputs, leading to higher consumer food prices. Energy-driven higher marketing costs have also impacted ocean shipping rates, nearly doubling the previous record set in 2004. High oil prices are considered a significant factor in driving up food costs. High oil prices have driven up food costs due to their impact on energy costs and the popularity of biofuels. U.S. fiscal policies aimed at preventing economic recession indirectly contributed to the \"food crises\" by weakening the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts in response to the financial crisis and weak economy led to a decline in the dollar's value, resulting in higher commodity exports and oil prices. A weakening dollar also leads to higher oil prices in international markets. The weakening U.S. economy, impacted by high oil prices, has led to surging oil import costs, pressuring the trade deficit and slowing economic activity. This has attracted speculative investment in bullish commodity markets, with agricultural commodities now seen as a safe haven for investors. The past six years have seen record farm incomes, with the past two years showing significant gains. The USDA's Economic Research Service predicts a record farm cash income of $96.6 billion in 2008, driven by higher commodity prices. Farm revenue gains are expected to surpass rising input expenses, leading to cash surpluses in farm communities. Government direct payments are forecasted to be $13.4 billion, slightly up from the previous year but below the four-year average. Higher market prices are expected to limit payments under price-triggered programs. Government direct payments for 2008/2009 are estimated at $5.8 billion, slightly down from the previous year. Price-triggered programs like CCP and LDP are projected to have outlays of about $0.5 billion, while fixed direct payments make up the majority of subsidy expenditures at $5.2 billion. Higher commodity prices impact crop insurance premiums and provide opportunities for producers to lock in high returns. Higher commodity prices in 2008 lead to increased insurance premiums, allowing producers to secure high per-acre returns. Prices for major program crops like corn saw a significant increase, resulting in higher volatility and premiums. Farmers can insure target revenue levels rather than just yields, with guarantees of $500 per acre for corn at a 75% coverage level. Similar high premiums and revenue guarantees are available for other major crops in key producing areas. Higher commodity prices in 2008 led to increased insurance premiums, allowing producers to secure high per-acre returns. Government support for federal crop insurance rises with higher prices, as the federal government subsidizes premiums by 50% to 60% and reimburses insurance companies for administrative expenses. Net federal outlays for crop insurance are projected to increase from $4.7 billion in 2008 to $7.1 billion in 2009. Livestock feed costs for 2008 are estimated at a record $45 billion, up over 18% from the previous year. In 2008, U.S. livestock feed costs were projected to reach a record $45 billion, up over 18% from the previous year. Rising feed costs have impacted profit margins in all livestock sectors, with Tyson Foods reporting its first loss in six quarters due to increased corn and soybean costs. Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted the harmful effects of rising corn prices on livestock producers, with every one-cent rise costing the state's livestock sector over $6 million. The U.S. livestock sector is facing challenges due to rising feed costs, with a one-cent increase in corn prices costing Texas over $6 million. The biofuels industry is impacting feed supplies, leading to uncertainty in feed logistics and composition. Agricultural futures prices have been rapidly escalating since 2005, affecting price discovery and risk management. The financial demands of routine hedging operations have increased with rising commodity prices, causing strains on market participants. Lack of convergence between cash and futures contract prices for certain commodities is raising the risk for grain buyers. This is concerning for traditional commercial interests and agricultural producers who rely on forward contracts for risk management. The high commodity prices have led to increased financial obligations for hedging operations, causing concerns about the lack of convergence between cash and futures prices. Despite no clear evidence, some accuse speculative money in agricultural futures markets of artificially inflating prices and volatility, calling for greater federal regulation. The rising costs of standard hedging operations have led to calls for increased federal regulation and monitoring of speculative participation in futures markets. Speculative investment is seen as adding necessary liquidity, but issues like electronic trading and daily price limit adjustments have exacerbated concerns. The CFTC held a Round Table in 2008 to address these issues and emphasize the importance of efficient agricultural futures markets. The Round Table in 2008 highlighted the importance of efficient agricultural futures markets and the need for increased monitoring by the CFTC. Market signals are expected to lead to higher yields and cultivated areas in response to increased demand. Yield improvements require investments in research, infrastructure, and intensive farming practices. In 2008, high commodity prices are likely to bring marginal land back into production, with 321 million acres planted in the US for major crops. Land-use shifts and cultivation practices can have harmful environmental consequences such as soil erosion and water quality degradation. In 2008, the USDA estimates an increase in planted acres for principal and program crops in the United States. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides payments to farmers to conserve soil and water resources by taking cropland out of production. The CRP had 34.6 million acres enrolled in February 2008, with land-use shifts expected due to market conditions. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for renewal or removal based on market conditions. Farmers can pay a penalty for early withdrawal, with no penalty-free release announced in 2007 and reiterated for 2008. In response to high feed prices, USDA allowed over 24 million CRP acres for hay or forage in 2008 after the nesting season. CRP provides environmental services like wildlife habitat and erosion control. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides environmental services such as critical wildlife habitat, erosion control, and carbon sequestration. Public interest in lower crop prices conflicts with maintaining environmental benefits of CRP. Millions of acres have opted out of CRP contracts, with potential future re-enrollments being discouraged by high commodity prices. Environmental organizations advocate for maintaining or expanding CRP levels, while livestock and food processing industries seek to reduce penalties for early withdrawal. The Alliance for Agriculture Growth and Competitiveness (AAGC) has been lobbying USDA to allow landowners to pull out of CRP contracts without penalty. If CRP policy remains unchanged, up to 2 million acres of CRP land per year could be brought back into crop production over the next 10 years. USDA's March Prospective Plantings report predicts a 2% increase in program crop planted acreage in 2008 due to high commodity prices. Economists suggest that U.S. farmers' ability to respond to high commodity prices is limited by a lack of viable cropland, leading to a proposal to \"re-optimize\" CRP through penalty elimination and aggressive rebidding of its holdings. CARD suggests re-optimizing CRP by eliminating penalties on expiring contracts and aggressively rebidding all CRP holdings. This would allow more productive land to return to production sooner and offer further protection to environmentally sensitive land. The rise in agricultural prices and high energy costs have led to higher food inflation, impacting consumers' dietary choices. Higher food prices affect households differently based on their income proportion spent on food. Food prices are influenced by the proportion of income spent on food, with low-income countries facing the most significant impact. In the United States, food prices rose by 4.2% in 2007 and are predicted to increase by 4.5% to 5.5% in 2008. This rise in prices poses a challenge for households, especially in low-income countries heavily reliant on food imports. Since 2005, the BLS food price index has shown an upward trend, with the 11-month moving average reaching its highest point in June 2007. Energy costs, especially fuel prices, have had a greater impact on food price inflation than commodity prices. Retail food prices are less volatile than farm-level prices due to additional costs like transportation and packaging. Despite the rise in food prices, U.S. households can absorb the increases easily in the short term, as food expenditures represent a small portion of total disposable income. In 2006, U.S. households spent about 10.5% of their income on food, with lower-income families spending over 20%. Food price inflation can lead to difficult spending choices for households. Food assistance programs like Food Stamps and child nutrition programs help meet minimum food needs, with rising prices leading to higher federal spending on these programs. In 2007, $33.2 billion was spent on the Food Stamp program, with recipients receiving an average of $95.63 per month. High commodity prices impact international markets differently based on import dependence and financial ability to respond. Import-dependent developing countries face greater food security risks due to higher commodity costs, affecting lower-income households severely. Developing countries heavily reliant on food imports and with high food expenses are at risk from rising food prices. Humanitarian groups are concerned about the impact of higher grain prices on these nations. The UN's FAO forecasts a $169 billion grain import bill for vulnerable countries in 2008, a 40% increase from 2007. High ocean freight rates in 2007 compounded the cost of food imports. While rates are expected to decrease slightly in 2008, rising crude oil prices may offset any savings. The political consequences of food shortages can be severe. The emerging food crisis since January 2008 has led to hoarding, theft, and civil unrest over food prices globally. In Haiti, food-price rioting toppled the prime minister. Higher commodity and food prices have reduced the international community's ability to provide food aid, as the amount of commodities that can be purchased declines with rising food prices. The UN's World Food Program estimated it would need $2.9 billion to cover its 2008 approved project needs to feed 73 million people in 78 countries. The World Food Program (WFP) has had to revise its operating needs assessment twice due to rising prices, requiring additional funding of $755 million. Rice suppliers are breaking contracts to sell at higher market prices. The United States provided $2.1 billion in food aid in 2006, but rising prices will lead to a reduction in emergency food aid in 2008. In 2008, rising food and fuel prices led to a significant reduction in emergency food aid. USAID faced a $200 million shortfall in funding for emergency food aid needs. President Bush directed the Secretary of Agriculture to access grain supplies from the BEHT valued at $200 million to meet international food aid needs. The Secretary of Agriculture accessed $200 million worth of grain supplies from the BEHT to address emergency food aid needs abroad in 2008. FAO forecasts a 3.8% expansion in world cereal production to a record 2.192 billion tons, mainly driven by wheat. Global supplies are expected to rebuild by late 2008, easing the tight cereal supply situation. However, commodity prices are likely to remain volatile until the 2008 harvests are completed. Repealing government policies limiting exports can lead to immediate price moderation and encourage investments in the long run. In the international wheat market, Ukraine has already reversed its export ban, and analysts expect Russia and Kazakhstan to follow suit by September. Japan plans to export 200,000 tons of rice to the Philippines, with China and Thailand also holding substantial rice stocks available for export. The Center for Global Development reports that these actions could help ease tight cereal supply situations and stabilize market prices. On May 26, 2008, Cambodia lifted its ban on rice exports, announcing over 1 million tons available for export. India is waiting for the monsoon rains before deciding on easing trade restrictions. Record production and easing export bans are expected to lower international rice prices in 2008. Biofuel demand has increased corn and soybean prices, leading to expanded crop production globally. Both USDA's and FAPRI's outlook projections for 2008 show expanded acreage in the United States and worldwide due to high prices bringing marginal land back into crop production. Expectations for increased double cropping of winter wheat and soybeans in the Delta and Southeast, along with a nation-wide return to crop production of pasture land and former CRP acres, are expected to boost planted area for corn, soybeans, and wheat by nearly 7 million acres to 224.6 million acres in the US. Similar area expansion is expected worldwide in response to strong price incentives and government policies. For example, StatsCanada forecasts Canadian wheat plantings to be up over 16% in 2008. In the EU, agriculture ministers suspended a 10% set-aside requirement, leading to additional land re-entering crop production and bolstering EU grain output by up to 17 million tons in 2008. Despite projections for record world grain production in 2008, only marginal global stock building is expected. Global grain production is projected to increase in 2008, but global stock building is expected to be marginal. The demand for livestock products and feedstuffs is anticipated to rise due to population growth and income growth in developing economies. Additionally, there will be an increased demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet biofuel usage policies in the US and EU, leading to strong demand for corn and vegetable oils over the next decade. Demand is expected to increase strongly for corn and vegetable oils over the next decade due to biofuel policies in the US and EU. Prices for feed grains and oilseeds are projected to remain high, with major US program crops expected to stay above average prices from 2002-2007. Increased agricultural production is needed to return to abundant supplies and moderate prices. Increased agricultural production is crucial for meeting the rising demand for corn and vegetable oils driven by biofuel policies in the US and EU. This requires investments in research, extension, and marketing infrastructure. Policy choices on agricultural productivity and renewable energy will shape commodity markets. Various policy responses are being suggested by major players to address short-term consumer needs and long-term productivity challenges. Various policy responses are being suggested by major players in the U.S. and international agricultural arena, including changes in current agricultural and food policy, reversal of biofuels policy, reduction in crop land retirement under the CRP program, and returning CRP land to agricultural production. The American Bakers Association (ABA) has advocated for these changes and put forward a three-point congressional action plan. The American Bakers Association (ABA) recommends reducing CRP land by 7 million acres, supporting early out-of-contract provisions, evaluating viable cropland for production, waiving RFS annual requirements, dropping tariffs on imported ethanol, prioritizing domestic food industry needs over export markets when wheat stocks are low, and addressing concerns about biofuels' impact on food prices and livestock feed. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association opposes the national biofuels RFS and calls for a market-based approach for ethanol production. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests a moratorium on global grain- and oilseed-based biofuels to ease corn and wheat prices. Texas Governor Rick Perry requested a 50% waiver of the RFS' ethanol requirements to alleviate corn prices. EPA Administrator has the authority to waive ethanol requirements under Section 211(o) of the Federal Clean Air Act. Governor Perry requested a waiver of the RFS' ethanol requirements to alleviate corn prices. EPA has 90 days to respond to the petition. The National Chicken Council supports the waiver, citing ethanol's impact on food costs. Some senators urged EPA to consider food inflation concerns. However, biofuels advocates argue that high oil prices and global factors are to blame, not just biofuels. Oil prices, global production shortfalls, and foreign export controls are the main factors contributing to the rise in agricultural prices. Congress has conducted hearings on this issue since May 1, 2008, focusing on the impact of high food prices on American families, the Renewable Fuels Standard, fuel subsidies, contributing factors to the global food crisis, international responses, and the impact on small businesses. Witness lists and testimony from these hearings are available on the respective committee's website. Several bills have been introduced in response to high commodity prices and their alleged causes, including bills to repeal biofuels mandates and tax credits, freeze the Renewable Fuels Standard, and consider new emergency appropriations. Congress is currently discussing legislative proposals to address the global food crisis. Congress is considering emergency supplemental appropriations bills for the Iraq war, which may include funding for the global food crisis. President Bush has requested additional food aid funding. New farm legislation has implications for U.S. response to food concerns, including nutrition programs, foreign food aid, food versus fuel debate, land use incentives, and agricultural productivity. On April 29, 2008, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced the formation of a task force to address the global food crisis caused by rising food prices. The task force will coordinate efforts of U.N. agencies, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, along with experts from the international community. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) are key U.N. agencies involved in international agricultural development and food aid. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) focuses on long-term goals such as improving nutrition, agricultural productivity, and rural livelihoods through research, extension support, and international collaboration. FAO launched the Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to assist Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries affected by rising food prices. The international community is coordinating efforts by various organizations like the World Bank, IFAD, WFP, and regional development banks to address the food-price crisis. Meetings are scheduled to discuss strategies and policy responses, leading up to the FAO's \"Summit on Food Security\" in Rome. Proposed actions include establishing a U.N. task force, providing emergency food aid and initiatives for poor food importers. The World Bank is exploring a rapid financing facility for the poor. The international community is coordinating efforts to address the food-price crisis by providing emergency aid and initiatives for poor food importers. The World Bank is exploring a rapid financing facility for poor countries, while the IMF proposes aid for countries facing balance of payments gaps. The U.N. calls for the lifting of food export restrictions. Suggestions include reversing protective country-level policies, reducing subsidies that divert agricultural land, and phasing out domestic policies that keep market prices low. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) issued policy recommendations to address high international commodity prices. Recommendations include reinforcing social protection programs, eliminating biofuel subsidies, removing trade barriers, and investing in agricultural research and infrastructure. The World Bank and Japanese officials have also released policy recommendations in response to the global food crisis. The World Bank focuses on improving household food security through targeted safety net programs, measures to lower domestic food prices, and stimulate medium-term food grain production. Japanese officials are offering a formal proposal in the WTO's Doha Round to address their food-import dependency and respond to the global food crisis. Japanese officials are proposing stronger disciplines on exporting members in the WTO's Doha Round to address the global food crisis and proliferation of export restrictions. The proposal includes eliminating existing export restrictions within the first year of a new agreement and allowing new restrictions for a maximum of 18 months in consultation with affected importers."
