    "content": "The \"Airline Passenger Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow significantly, while the number of certified large air carriers has decreased. Many communities that had scheduled air service in 1978 no longer have it, and there have been significant fare increases in certain city pairs. The number of airline passengers on US carriers has decreased by over 20 percent. A 1998 study found that large US air carriers charge higher fares at hub airports without low fare competition. Complaints about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent, with delays in flights worsening according to a 1997 report. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission predicts a 52 percent increase in US domestic and international passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006. The Federal Aviation Administration forecasts a 4.2 percent annual growth in revenue passenger miles. A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that major US airlines charge 60 percent more for flights to or from small communities compared to large communities. Congress has instructed the Secretary of Transportation to prevent unfair practices in the airline industry. SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include specific practices for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers about oversold flights, allowing the use of portions of a ticket, timely delivery of checked baggage, and providing full access to all fares. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code requires certificated air carriers to provide passengers with full access to all fares, notify passengers of flight delays in advance, accurately inform passengers of flight disruptions, refund unused tickets within 48 hours of purchase, and disclose information on frequent flyer programs for informed decision-making. The Secretary must report violations of certificated air carriers in the Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. The term 'confirmed reserved space' refers to a space on a specific date, flight, and class of service requested by a passenger and verified by the carrier."
