    "content": "The \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings. Congress finds that it delegated the power to regulate the value of money to the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The value of the US dollar has significantly dropped compared to gold, oil, and other currencies, leading to instability. The Federal Reserve has not provided a stable value for the dollar, which hinders economic growth. An unstable dollar has negative effects on the economy, including slowing growth, increasing costs of capital, reducing real earnings of workers, and diminishing the value of financial assets and retirement accounts. It also damages the US's standing in the global community and creates anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed to use banking powers to ensure stable financial markets during and after the transition. SEC. 4.
