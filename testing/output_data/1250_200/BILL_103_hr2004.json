    "content": "The Congressional findings are outlined in Section 1. The United States textile machinery industry, consisting of approximately 500 small businesses, is essential for textile production for various industries. The industry has been weakened by imports and trade barriers, posing a threat to the textile and apparel complex. The United States textile machinery industry is facing challenges with declining exports, leading to offshore competition, loss of tariff revenue, and a decrease in employment. This industry plays a significant role in the country's economy, providing economic benefits such as tariffs on imports, job preservation, and industrial growth. The textile machinery industry has seen a significant decline in employment over the last two decades, from 28,500 individuals to 17,800. Recapturing this market is crucial for improving the balance of trade. Trade impacted businesses should have access to capital from subsidized competition, and government studies recommend developing research and development programs to sustain and expand the industry. The Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 324, establishing the Textile Machinery Modernization Fund. The Textile Machinery Modernization Fund, established under SEC. 324 of the Tariff Act of 1930, defines key terms such as 'Fund', 'qualified organization', 'qualified research project', 'Secretary', and 'textile machinery and parts thereof'. The Textile Machinery Modernization Fund, established under SEC. 324 of the Tariff Act of 1930, includes articles in specific subheadings and headings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. It establishes a fund in the Treasury for grants to qualified organizations for research projects and industry-wide research and promotion. The Secretary may make grants to qualified organizations for research projects, with terms and conditions to protect US interests. The Secretary can provide a statement of intent to fund research projects before they begin. Grants must be made in consultation with representatives from the textile industries and the public. The Secretary may make grants to qualified organizations for research projects in consultation with textile industry representatives and the public. Grants are limited to 60% of project costs and are capped based on the organization's previous annual expenditures for textile machinery research. The Fund for grants may prorate payments if total amount is less than approved grants. Appropriations to the Fund are from customs duties on textile machinery, with a limit of $10,000,000 per fiscal year."
