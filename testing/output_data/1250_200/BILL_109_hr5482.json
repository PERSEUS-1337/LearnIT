    "content": "The \"Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for the protection of data through security freeze measures. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include a new section on protection of data through security freeze. Consumers can request a security freeze on their consumer report to prevent release of information without authorization. The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows consumers to request a security freeze on their consumer report, preventing unauthorized release of information to third parties. The security freeze remains in place until the consumer requests its removal, which can be done in writing or by telephone. A consumer reporting agency can only remove a security freeze on a consumer report if requested by the consumer or if there was a material misrepresentation of fact. The agency must notify the consumer in writing before removing the freeze. Consumers can temporarily suspend the security freeze by specifying dates in writing or by telephone. Consumer reporting agencies must place a security freeze on a consumer report within 5 business days of receiving a request, and remove or temporarily suspend it within 3 business days upon request. If the consumer asks, the agency must notify other covered entities within 3 days. Consumer reporting agencies must notify other consumer reporting agencies within 3 days of placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze on a consumer report. The notified agency must take action within 3 business days. Additionally, the agency must send a written confirmation to the consumer within 10 business days after the security freeze is placed, removed, or temporarily suspended. Consumer reporting agencies must send a written confirmation to the consumer within 10 business days after placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze on the consumer report. Proper identification is required for any request to place, remove, or temporarily suspend a security freeze. Exceptions apply to the use of consumer credit reports by certain entities. Entities that can access consumer information include financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, child support agencies, and agencies investigating medicare or medicaid fraud. Entities such as financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and agencies investigating medicare or medicaid fraud can access consumer information for various purposes, including investigating fraud, collecting taxes, providing credit file monitoring subscriptions, and fulfilling statutory responsibilities. Consumer reporting agencies may charge reasonable fees for certain services. Consumer reporting agencies can charge reasonable fees for placing or temporarily suspending a security freeze on a consumer report, with considerations based on prevailing state laws. However, no fee can be charged for removing a security freeze. For victims of identity theft, no fees can be charged for placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze on their consumer report. Consumer reporting agencies can suspend a security freeze on a consumer report if the consumer is a victim of identity theft and has filed a police report, or if there has been a data security breach involving the consumer's information. If a security freeze is in place, the agency cannot change the consumer's name, date of birth, or Social Security number without notifying the consumer in writing within 30 days. Consumer reporting agencies must notify the consumer in writing within 30 days if they change the consumer's name, date of birth, Social Security number, or address. Written confirmation is required for address changes to both the new and former addresses. Certain entity exemptions apply to agencies that act as resellers of credit information. Consumer reporting agencies can merge information from other agencies but do not maintain a permanent database for new reports. Certain entities, like check services or fraud prevention companies, are exempt from placing security freezes on consumer reports. Deposit account information services provide reports on negative consumer information to financial institutions. The amendment allows consumer information to be shared with financial institutions for reviewing consumer requests for deposit accounts. The amendment will take effect after a 6-month period from the enactment of the Act."
