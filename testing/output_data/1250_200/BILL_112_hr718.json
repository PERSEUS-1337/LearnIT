    "content": "The \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration. Approximately 30,000 individuals in the US are affected, with 200,000 at genetic risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset typically occurs between ages 30 and 50. Late-onset Huntington's Disease occurs after 50 years of age with milder symptoms. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 years old and progresses rapidly. Due to the disease's debilitating nature, individuals rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite medical advancements, Social Security rules for evaluating neurological disabilities have not been updated since 1985. The term \"Huntington's Chorea\" used by the Social Security Administration is outdated and inaccurate, failing to recognize the full impact of Huntington's Disease. Individuals with Huntington's Disease face a 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits, despite often becoming incapacitated before age 65. Unlike ALS patients, they do not have the waiting period waived. The Social Security Administration needs to update its guidelines for individuals with Huntington's Disease, similar to the exemptions provided for ALS patients. This includes revising the medical and evaluation criteria for disability determination and removing the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage. The Social Security Administration needs to update guidelines for individuals with Huntington's Disease, including revising medical and evaluation criteria for disability determination. The Social Security Administration will update guidelines for Huntington's Disease disability determinations by amending sections of the Listing of Impairments for adults and children. The Social Security Administration will update guidelines for Huntington's Disease disability determinations by amending sections of the Listing of Impairments for adults and children, including providing medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This change applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for services provided after the enactment of this Act."
