    "content": "Nuclear weapons will continue to be crucial for U.S. security policy, but maintaining current Cold War-era weapons is becoming challenging. Congress faces the decision of how to sustain the nuclear stockpile for the future. Options include extending the service lives of current warheads or developing a new generation without testing. The report compares these options in terms of congressional goals, costs, risks, and benefits. The possibility of resuming nuclear testing, suspended since 1992, is also discussed. The report discusses options for maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile, including extending the service lives of current warheads or developing a new generation without testing. Resuming nuclear testing is also considered, but not as a separate option. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was instituted in 1993 to ensure the safety and reliability of aging warheads. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) was established in 1993 to preserve U.S. nuclear weapons expertise without testing. NNSA requests $6,511.3 million for SSP in FY2008 for the Life Extension Program (LEP) to maintain warheads by replacing components as needed. Congress is concerned about maintaining confidence in current warheads for the long term. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program was initiated by Congress in response to concerns about maintaining confidence in current warheads for the long term. The program aims to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons through cooperation between NNSA and DOD. The RRW Project Officers Group (POG) develops military characteristics for new warheads, with safety as the top priority followed by security/use control. Other priorities include certifiability, cost, longevity, and manufacturability. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program priorities include safety as the first priority, followed by security/use control. Other priorities are certifiability, cost, longevity, manufacturability, reliability, survivability in nuclear environments, and yield. Congress has outlined at least 20 goals for RRW, including reducing the need for nuclear testing, improving safety and use control, and reducing the cost of the stockpile and Complex. Two design teams from New Mexico and California competed to create preliminary warhead designs meeting these goals. Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Sandia's CA site created preliminary warhead designs between October 2005 and March 2006. The Nuclear Weapons Council determined that RRW is a feasible strategy for sustaining U.S. nuclear weapons without testing. The California design was selected as the first RRW, or RRW-1, now called \"WR1.\" NNSA requested funds for Phase 2A and Phase 3 of nuclear weapons development in FY2008. The Navy-led RRW POG is conducting a design definition and cost study for the California design. The choice between LEP, RRW, or a combination will impact U.S. nuclear weapons for decades. The decision between LEP, RRW, or a combination will shape U.S. nuclear weapons for years. Congress must decide on funding for these programs annually. Moving RRW to Phase 3 is a key decision, with uncertainties in cost and technical feasibility. The future of the RRW design and its long-term costs are crucial factors to consider. The future of the RRW design and its long-term costs are uncertain, with technical uncertainties and the need for a decision on funding annually. Proponents of RRW claim it is cheaper and safer than LEP, but there are no numbers to substantiate these claims. Congress is divided on whether to continue RRW design activities without a revised U.S. nuclear weapons strategy. The House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee called for a congressional commission to review U.S. strategic posture and nuclear weapons strategy before committing to ambitious new programs like the RRW. The commission's report would be due by December 2008 and December 2009 respectively. Congress might delay RRW until the next President reviews U.S. nuclear policy. Congress may delay RRW in Phase 2A until the next President reviews U.S. nuclear policy. The earliest request to move RRW to Phase 3 could be in the FY2011 budget. S. 1914 calls for nuclear policy and posture reviews by September 2009 and March 2010. Some recommend continuing R&D on RRW, citing the need to strengthen infrastructure. Former officials support research on new technologies. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act sets a target for the RRW first production unit in 2012, with some uncertainty about meeting that date. Former officials support research on new RRW designs, emphasizing the need to strengthen infrastructure. The memorandum from March 2007 sets a target for the First Production Unit of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) in 2014, with potential delays if not moved to Phase 3. Various goals for the RRW project are interconnected, aiming for a more efficient Complex, increased reliability, and reduced long-term costs through improved design and production processes. Efforts to enhance RRW resistance, ease of manufacture, and environmental friendliness could lead to a smaller and more modern Complex. Reducing hazardous materials usage would improve safety, lower costs, and minimize waste streams. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) project aims to improve efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness by designing warheads for ease of manufacture, assembly, and maintenance. This includes reducing waste streams, increasing productivity by moving work outside high-cost buildings, and making warheads more resistant to terrorist attacks. Congressional language on whether RRW is considered a \"new warhead\" remains ambiguous. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) project aims to improve existing weapons and components, develop replacement components for nuclear warheads, and ensure the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems. Ambiguity arises in defining terms like \"weapon\" and \"new,\" as well as in the design parameters of the RRW initiative. The goal is to design re-engineered and remanufactured warheads for existing weapon systems in the stockpile. The term \"new\" is ambiguous in the context of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) project. The design considerations of Cold War warheads focused on maximizing yield to weight, leading to tight designs that could not easily accommodate goals such as increased safety and reduced cost. The Life Extension Program's potential changes to the nuclear explosive package (NEP) raise concerns about the warheads' reliability. The report discusses the division between \"supporters\" and \"critics\" of RRW, highlighting key points of contention. The report discusses the division between \"supporters\" and \"critics\" of RRW, with finer divisions of opinion existing. Raymond Jeanloz, a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley, finds many objectives of RRW reasonable but is concerned about implementation. Some RRW supporters question aspects of RRW designs, and supporters of RRW are not necessarily critics of LEP. Los Alamos has found compelling designs for RRW, providing added margin, surety, and manufacturability. The report discusses the division between \"supporters\" and \"critics\" of RRW, with finer divisions of opinion existing. Los Alamos has found compelling designs for RRW, providing added margin, surety, and manufacturability. They are open to pursuing LEP strategies if decided by the Administration, Congress, and the DoD. The report also addresses terminological notes regarding the RRW program and distinguishes between \"Competing Candidate RRW Designs\" and actual RRWs that may be built in the future. The report distinguishes between \"Competing Candidate RRW Designs\" (CCRDs), the RRW program, and potential future RRWs. The House Appropriations Committee directed an independent peer review by the JASONs to evaluate the RRW designs against congressional requirements and DoD military characteristics. The review also assesses the feasibility of designing, producing, and certifying a new nuclear warhead without underground nuclear testing. The report was due on March 31, 2007. The report on the nuclear explosion test was scheduled to be submitted in stages, with a preliminary report due on March 1, 2007, an executive summary by August 1, 2007, and the final report by October 1, 2007. The Nuclear Weapons Complex Assessment Committee studied the Reliable Replacement Warhead program's feasibility and implementation. The report discusses the Reliable Replacement Warhead program's impact on Stockpile Life Extension Programs and how competing designs aim to meet congressional goals. Warheads were designed near failure points, but nuclear testing provided confidence for stockpile placement. The Stockpile Stewardship Program has enabled weapon maintenance without nuclear testing through various means like nonnuclear experiments and computer simulations. The Stockpile Stewardship Program has developed various means to understand warhead performance without nuclear testing. While annual assessments confirm warhead safety, concerns exist about long-term reliability due to changes from Life Extension Programs. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to minimize the need for testing by increasing confidence through new steps. Critics argue that existing warheads can remain reliable with careful attention and scientific advances. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase confidence in warhead reliability through new steps. Critics argue that without nuclear testing, the tools used may lead to false conclusions. Former LANL Director suggests that nuclear testing would validate tools and techniques, with yields of 10 kt being sufficient in most cases. Sandia report defines reliability for a nuclear warhead as the probability of achieving specified yield across various environments throughout its lifetime. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase confidence in warhead reliability through new steps. Sandia report defines reliability for a nuclear warhead as the probability of achieving specified yield across various environments throughout its lifetime, with proper inputs being crucial. Designers of the first RRW seek high reliability by maximizing margins to account for material deterioration or defects. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase confidence in warhead reliability through new steps. Sandia report states that diagnostic systems could help detect deterioration early. RRW advocates foresee challenges in maintaining existing warheads' reliability due to aging. LEP supporters argue current warheads are reliable based on stockpile assessments. Both sides agree on gaining a better understanding of nuclear stockpile performance over time. Richard Garwin challenges the idea that current warheads' reliability must decline. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase confidence in warhead reliability through new steps. Supporters question if RRW will improve reliability, while critics raise concerns about the current ability to certify WR1. The JASON RRW report of September 2007 highlighted uncertainties in certification and the need for further development in the certification plan. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino noted differing views on the report among supporters and critics. The certification plan for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program needs further development. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino stated that certification without new underground testing is a reasonable expectation, but some doubt the reliability of LEP or RRW. Representatives Visclosky and Hobson raised serious questions that must be addressed before proceeding with RRW. Some doubt the reliability of LEP or RRW as a 21st-century nuclear deterrent. Stewardship tools should not be solely relied upon, and new warheads cannot be deemed reliable without testing. Margins, uncertainty, and confidence play a crucial role in understanding the risks of implementing RRW or LEP without nuclear testing. Margin is the excess performance built into the design, uncertainty arises from imprecise knowledge, and confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty. The labs use computer models and experimental data to bound uncertainties and ensure performance. Confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty, with margins greater than uncertainties providing confidence against failure modes. The Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) framework formalizes the relationship between margins, uncertainties, and confidence. This framework is used by LANL and LLNL to assess confidence in weapon performance in the absence of testing. The nuclear weapons program has historically used QMU to build margins into warhead designs and assess performance risks. Current missile warheads focus on maximizing explosive yield while minimizing weight, resulting in \"thin\" margins that were previously validated through nuclear testing. For the RRW project, designers at LANL and LLNL adjusted design parameters to increase margins for confidence without nuclear testing. By using existing nuclear test data, they ensured that primary margins exceed minimum requirements. The key advantage of starting fresh designs is the ability to increase margin, compensating for uncertainties and enabling confidence without testing. This approach contrasts with the limitations of increasing margin in LEPs that require changes to the warhead design. Critics of the RRW project argue that increasing margin in Life Extension Programs (LEPs) is limited due to the need for changes to the warhead design, pushing it beyond validated parameters. They suggest maintaining margins through careful remanufacture of nuclear components and revising boost gas handling methods instead. Critics fear that RRWs may introduce uncertainties and \"birth defects\" due to their new designs, unlike existing designs where issues have been resolved over time. The 1996 Sandia study showed that most problems with stockpile surveillance occurred in the first three years after FPU, with fewer issues in years 4-11 and very few after year 12. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act required NNSA to study the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties for nuclear stockpile assessment. The NAS is working on a report for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to reduce the need for nuclear weapons testing. The key issues for nuclear weapons are ensuring the primary boost provides enough energy and that energy transfers successfully to the secondary. Design concepts are rejected if they don't align with past nuclear testing parameters. Livermore affirms that all RRW/CA components are validated by prior experience. Livermore states that all RRW/CA components have been nuclear tested, providing direct proof of proper performance. The design also incorporates over 100 other nuclear tests to ensure confidence in materials and features. The RRW/CA team utilized LEP and Stockpile Stewardship to develop certification tools, boosting confidence in the design. Advocates of LEP argue that existing warheads have been extensively tested and stay within validated design parameters, while critics point out that changes introduced by LEPs and maintenance modifications may move warheads away from these parameters. The JASON report of September 2007 raised concerns about moving beyond tested designs due to uncertainties in modeling and predicting excursions from validated design parameters. RRW advocates believe that RRW, drawing on a tested design with additional margin, avoids excursions, while LEPs result in slight changes leading to excursions. Certification plans define the scope of work needed to certify a warhead design to DOD, with past processes involving computation, experiments, and nuclear testing. LEPs are also certified during development, taking about three to six months. The Major Assembly Release for warheads was issued based on information provided. LEPs are certified in the development cycle using SSP tools. The RRW design teams applied lessons learned in certifying LEPs to increase confidence. Design choices were made to improve performance parameters and avoid failure modes. The high margin-to-uncertainty ratios allowed for easy certification through the QMU approach. Various SSP tools were used to provide confidence in the design. LANL used hydrodynamic facilities for confidence in certifying warhead design. RRW supporters argue that LEP certification is challenging due to the need to replicate original manufacturing processes closely. RRW design starts with modern processes for easier certification. The RRW design aims to create a warhead that can be certified without testing, using modern manufacturing processes selected for ease of certification. Experts question if it can maintain confidence in warhead performance when parameters are altered. Analysis and scrutiny are needed to determine the extent of parameter alterations before deceiving ourselves. The challenge is convincing leaders in the White House, Pentagon, or U.S. Strategic Command of the design's reliability. The RRW design aims to create a warhead that can be certified without testing, using modern manufacturing processes selected for ease of certification. Experts question if it can maintain confidence in warhead performance when parameters are altered. The challenge is convincing leaders in the White House, Pentagon, or U.S. Strategic Command of the design's reliability, without requiring new test data. Critics argue that replacing tested devices with untested ones may compromise U.S. security. The RRW design aims to create a warhead that can be certified without testing, using modern manufacturing processes selected for ease of certification. Supporters argue that the link between fielded warheads and nuclear tests is complex, with safety and use control features incorporated into the designs by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Sandia National Laboratories is responsible for nonnuclear components and integration into the warhead, with all stockpile weapons meeting safety requirements specified by DOD. The current stockpile weapons meet safety requirements specified by DOD, but nuclear detonation safety cannot be assured in abnormal environments. Warheads without design features for the \"Trinity condition\" must have a specific exception. RRW designs do not require this exception. LEP advocates believe current warheads are safe enough and view scenarios like Trinity as farfetched. Analysts can always create scenarios to justify new weapons, but it does not necessitate large spending. The current stockpile weapons meet safety requirements specified by DOD, but nuclear detonation safety cannot be assured in abnormal environments. Critics note that no U.S. warhead has ever detonated accidentally, with later warhead designs incorporating lessons learned to reduce risk. Current weapon systems have use control features designed to meet Cold War threats, such as the permissive action link. The 9/11 attacks changed use control requirements dramatically. During the Cold War, the main security threat to nuclear forces was from spies trying to steal secrets. Today, in addition to the threat of classified material theft, there is a post-9/11 terrorist threat. Security posture has shifted to deny access to warheads, increasing security costs. New technologies and approaches are being considered to reduce physical security costs. LLNL and LANL have developed designs with enhanced use control features, while RRW is mentioned in contrast. The CA design by LLNL and NM design by LANL offer unprecedented use control features, deemed revolutionary. RRW advocates highlight the challenge of retrofitting new features into current missile warheads due to tight designs. The new safety and use control features add cost and complexity, potentially impacting reliability. Enhanced use control is crucial for the Air Force, especially for ICBM warheads vulnerable outside silos. Physical security measures would not be reduced, even with enhanced use control features. The Air Force considers enhanced use control features for RRWs, which may reduce reliability slightly but offer more security options. Testing these features can build confidence in their value, and they are not expected to hinder field operations. Critics question the need for additional use control, citing the effectiveness of current warheads and security measures. Upgrading physical security and reducing weapon storage sites can enhance use control and reduce risks. Upgrading physical security and reducing weapon storage sites can improve use control to reduce the risk of unauthorized detonation of a U.S. warhead. Some suggest redirecting funds to secure Russian warheads and nuclear materials, while others advocate for increasing safety and use control, even considering the resumption of nuclear tests for greater intrinsic warhead safety improvements. Advances in safety design of nonnuclear systems of nuclear weapons can be made without testing, but some innovative concepts for enhancement may be limited. Insensitive high explosive (IHE) is safer than conventional high explosive (CHE) used in warheads, reducing the risk of nonnuclear explosions. The use of Insensitive High Explosive (IHE) in warheads like the RRW aims to enhance safety by reducing the risk of nonnuclear explosions. While IHE is less energetic than conventional high explosive (CHE), it offers improved safety benefits. However, the transition to IHE in warheads like the W76 LEP may pose challenges as the current design relies on CHE. Despite the advantages of IHE, some argue that the safety benefits may not outweigh the drawbacks of switching to a new warhead design. The labs initially prioritized characteristics like cost and ease of manufacture over safety when developing warheads. However, with the emergence of SSP and LEPs in the 1990s, collaboration with plants increased to focus on safety and ease of manufacture. Congressional goals for RRW emphasized reduced hazardous materials and lower costs, leading to intensive collaboration on safer and easier-to-manufacture designs. Designing warheads for safety also often reduces costs and simplifies manufacturing processes. The development of CCRDs focuses on reducing waste streams, potential harm to the environment, and improving worker safety. Designing warheads for safety and ease of manufacture can lower costs and make manufacturing easier. RRW aims to use safer materials and reduce hazardous material usage, while LEPs may retain existing pits to achieve similar goals. Critics argue that LEPs could meet safety goals in different ways compared to RRWs. The development of CCRDs focuses on reducing waste streams, potential harm to the environment, and improving worker safety. Both designs aim to eliminate production steps, reduce worker radiation exposure, and enhance safety at Pantex. Safety requirements have increased at Pantex, leading to a more formal safety analysis and documented weapon response. The use of Improved High Explosives (IHE) in the Competing Candidate RRW Designs (CCRDs) demonstrates how improved safety can facilitate manufacturing processes at Pantex. At Pantex, bays and cells are used for assembling and disassembling warheads. Cells are designed for more dangerous operations, limiting throughput for operations involving CHE and plutonium. RRWs are advocated for their safer manufacturing processes compared to LEPs, reducing radiation waste and worker exposure. The use of IHE and new processes like optical isolation improve safety and ease of manufacturing at Pantex. Safety concerns include the risk of electrostatic discharge detonating CHE. The NM design at Pantex includes optical isolation to prevent electrostatic discharge detonating CHE, improving safety and ease of manufacturing. The RRW program represents a substantial step change improvement in safety according to Kent Fortenberry, Technical Director of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The RRW program has the potential for a significant safety improvement in nuclear weapon manufacturing. Design proposals aim to enhance safety by eliminating hazardous materials, simplifying processing steps, and reducing waste streams. Critics argue that LEP could also increase safety. Critics argue that the Life Extension Program (LEP) could increase safety by manufacturing and replacing fewer components, improving safety practices, and focusing on a \"safety culture\" at nuclear weapon plants like Pantex. Pantex has a good safety record with no ESD events causing death or serious injury. Pantex has a good safety record with no ESD events causing death or serious injury. The last time a Pantex worker was killed or seriously injured by an accident involving CHE was in 1977. Pantex wanted designs to minimize assembly and disassembly steps, with a focus on relaxing tolerances for easier manufacturing, increased throughput, and cost reduction. CCRDs could facilitate manufacturing by allowing for relaxed tolerances, enabling gauging and certification of pits in process on production machines. The new process for manufacturing RRW pits will utilize a direct casting process that greatly reduces the required number of subsequent process steps. The NM design also makes assembly and disassembly easier by minimizing the use of adhesives and reducing part count. LLNL's new process for fabricating RRW pits holds the potential to increase manufacturing efficiency by eliminating bottlenecks and reducing workstations and process steps by about 25 percent. LLNL has proposed replacing a major component for current warheads with a new-design RRW component that could be manufactured commercially, using less hazardous material to simplify manufacturing. Critics argue that LEP may offer manufacturing efficiencies, with a study estimating minimum pit life at 85-100 years or more, deferring the need for most pit production. Manufacturing improvements for nonnuclear warhead components can be made equally for LEP or RRW, depending on the warhead to be life-extended. Ease of manufacture for RRWs compared to LEPs depends on various factors. The LEP process for warheads depends on factors like IHE, margins, hazardous materials, and pit requirements. Current warheads are removed and surveilled annually, burdening the Complex, Air Force, and Navy. Proposed designs aim to reduce surveillance removals through improved techniques and calibrated shelf life units. The proposed designs for warheads include embedding sensors to gather data on environmental conditions and weapon status, making disassembly easier. These sensors could provide valuable information without the need for extensive surveillance or disassembly. The proposed designs for warheads include embedding sensors for data collection and easier disassembly. Critics raise concerns about potential issues with maintenance techniques and sensor data accuracy. Robert Peurifoy, former Vice President of Technical Support at Sandia National Laboratories, suggests that accelerated aging tests are the best way to search for material incompatibilities. Critics of the RRW surveillance plan are concerned that examining fewer warheads each year could reduce confidence in reliability estimates. RRW may offer increased longevity due to the use of materials with longer expected life and easier surveillance and disassembly processes. However, long service life is not a primary focus of the program, and RRW's longevity may not be a significant advantage over LEP. NNSA's vision for the Complex of 2030 includes a continuous design and deployment cycle, potentially keeping RRWs in service for two to three decades. Under the RRW plan, warheads may stay in service for two to three decades, similar to current warheads. RRW longevity is not a major focus, as LEP programs can also extend warhead lifetimes by 20-30 years. The Navy has confidence in LEP programs, but there is debate on how long they can maintain this confidence. RRW supporters argue for unexpected improvements. The debate over the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) revolves around the ability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to anticipate and resolve unexpected warhead degradations. Supporters of RRW argue that potential issues may exceed SSP's capabilities, while LEP supporters believe that as SSP improves, so will the ability to predict and maintain warheads. The proposed WR1 warhead would have a yield similar to the W76, fitting into the Mk5 aeroshell for improved accuracy. It aims to replace existing warheads with new designs capable of current missions, without relying on new physical principles for nuclear explosions. The WR1 warhead is designed to match the yield of the W76, replacing existing warheads without relying on new physical principles for nuclear explosions. It is not intended for new missions like low-yield or bunker busting capabilities. Supporters argue that retaining and modifying existing warheads through Life Extension Programs (LEPs) can maintain the U.S. deterrent force, while others believe in developing new warheads for potential future threats, possibly through resumed nuclear testing. The W76 warhead, first deployed in 1978, faces competition with WR1 for production resources. RRWs aim to maintain military capabilities of W76 in a design compatible with Mk5. LEP supporters argue W88s hedge against W76 failure, extending warhead life by 30 years. The Navy is questioning the need for a new, untested warhead to replace the W76 warhead, which has been in inventory for nearly three decades and is supposed to be effective for decades more. The W76 Life Extension Program (LEP) is seen as the most cost-effective way to provide SLBM warheads for the stockpile. Supporters believe that Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) would complement LEPs well, as current warheads cannot be modified to meet congressional requirements. The RRWs could potentially replace current warheads without nuclear testing, meeting post-Cold War requirements and congressional goals. The Air Force raises concerns about the complexity and inefficiency of Life Extension Programs for current warheads. The Air Force had concerns about the complexity and inefficiency of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for current warheads. The process of LEPs can be time-consuming and involve hazardous materials. There were delays in making changes to the W87 ICBM warhead, raising questions about the ability of the Complex to execute LEPs as a long-term sustainment strategy. Critics believe LEPs will allow the maintenance of current warheads for many years, despite potential costs and challenges. The Navy official supports the Life Extension Program (LEP) for the W76 warhead, despite concerns about costs and hazardous materials. Critics argue that the cost of LEPs should be weighed against the uncertainties of designing and deploying Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs). The President approves the number of U.S. warheads annually, with the deployment depending on military and political needs. The Department of Defense (DOD) retains nondeployed warheads to hedge against technical and geopolitical risks. Supporters of RRWs claim that they would reduce the need for nondeployed warheads due to increased margins and easier defect correction. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) argue that they would reduce the need for nondeployed warheads by increasing margins, making defect correction easier, and allowing for interchangeability between different delivery systems. This approach would provide flexibility in backup options for various delivery vehicles, such as SLBMs, ICBMs, cruise missiles, and gravity bombs. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) believe that surveillance and life-extension programs have improved the ability to address technical issues, reducing the need for nondeployed warheads. They argue that having too few RRWs would conflict with the goal of fewer nondeployed warheads. However, they suggest retaining nondeployed warheads to hedge against unforeseen geopolitical risks. Concerns have been raised about the impact of RRWs and Life Extension Programs (LEP) on upgrading the Complex and maintaining its skill base. The Complex's size, efficiency, and cost are under scrutiny regarding upgrades and skill base maintenance. Analysts have long noted the poor condition of production plants dating back to World War II. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to repair the nuclear infrastructure for increased confidence in deployed forces and to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads. General Cartwright highlighted the importance of an upgraded nuclear weapons infrastructure for safety, security, and reliability. NNSA Deputy Administrator D'Agostino mentioned establishing goals for responsiveness in collaboration with the DoD. NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, Thomas D'Agostino, has set goals for responsiveness in addressing stockpile issues and emerging threats within 12 months of discovery. Proposed plans by the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board and NNSA aim to consolidate fissile material, eliminate redundancies in R&D facilities, and reconfigure the Complex by 2030. Opinions vary on the link between Responsive Infrastructure and Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW), with supporters arguing for a more efficient Complex with RRWs. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW) argue that it would lead to a more efficient Complex by simplifying production, reducing rejected parts, increasing throughput at Pantex, and enabling more manufacturing to be done away from costly floor space. They claim that RRW eliminates hazardous materials production units, resulting in fewer and smaller waste treatment facilities. In contrast, supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) believe it locks the Complex into existing designs and processes. Former officials emphasize the importance of infrastructure in deciding on RRW. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) question the need for dismantling warheads and building new facilities for Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW). They argue that existing facilities could likely meet any new-design warhead needs. Some acknowledge the need to modernize production plants but question if focusing on RRW is the right approach. They suggest narrowing the range of materials handled by the Complex instead. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) question the need for dismantling warheads and building new facilities for Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW). They argue that existing facilities could likely meet any new-design warhead needs. Some acknowledge the need to modernize production plants but question if focusing on RRW is the right approach, suggesting narrowing the range of materials handled by the Complex. DOE, NNSA, and Complex staff believe it is crucial to maintain a diverse set of skills in the Complex to protect against technological surprises and design weapons with new military characteristics, which the RRW program aims to achieve. The RRW design program looks at the overall weapon design, providing the opportunity to develop safety, security, and use control features that cannot be done with an LEP limited to extending the life of existing designs. The RRW program aims to develop safety, security, and use control features that cannot be achieved with Life Extension Programs (LEP). Sandia emphasizes the importance of exercising all skills required for designing, testing, and producing complete systems to address higher-priority problems effectively. Livermore and Los Alamos agree that practicing all aspects of the craft is essential for the nuclear weapons complex to be responsive to unforeseen challenges. Livermore and Los Alamos agree that the RRW program aims to make the nuclear weapons complex more responsive to unforeseen challenges by enabling easier manufacturing, certification, and maintenance of warheads. This approach allows for the replacement of problem warheads with more reliable ones, reducing the need for a large inventory of reserves. NNSA prefers a continuous cycle of design and deployment for RRWs to exercise complex capabilities, rather than conducting Life Extension Programs in the future. A SEAB Task Force also supports an ongoing program of RRW design and production on a five-year cycle. LANL argues that the RRW program, with its new design approach, would enhance recruitment, retention, and capability development in the Complex workforce. Designing RRW involves balancing various factors simultaneously, unlike LEP which constrains choices due to replication requirements. LEP advocates argue that it also exercises skills in design, production, and certification to ensure safety and reliability. The AAAS report highlights the similarities between life extension and new design processes for warheads. It suggests that unforeseen problems are less likely for life extension programs compared to new designs. Retaining inactive warheads is seen as a more timely hedge than relying on a Complex in transition to produce Replacement Warheads (RRWs). Proponents of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that designing and producing new warheads in small quantities without deploying them can maintain the ability to produce new warheads while avoiding reliability risks and production costs. RRW supporters argue that designing and producing new warheads in small quantities without deploying them can maintain the ability to produce new warheads while avoiding reliability risks and production costs. They believe that building small lots would be less costly than large builds, which would impose additional costs on the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE). The RRW program is still in early stages, with many unknown factors affecting costs such as design and production details. Nonetheless, supporters claim that RRW designs focus on reducing costs through ease of manufacture, assembly, and the use of safer materials. The RRW program aims to lower surveillance costs by reducing the number of basic designs and modifications in the stockpile. It plans to use embedded sensors for condition monitoring, enhance use-control features for security, and increase design margins for tolerance to flaws. This approach is expected to make RRWs more cost-effective in terms of maintenance, dismantlement, and disposal compared to legacy warheads. The RRW program aims to reduce costs of dismantlement and disposal by using new components. Supporters argue that LEP costs are predictable due to experience with existing warheads. LEPs consume a small fraction of the total budget, while RRW supporters doubt its cost-saving potential. Advocates of LEP question the potential cost savings of the RRW program, expressing concerns about the large investment costs and uncertainty about when any savings might offset these costs. They highlight the risk of needing to build more RRWs in response to unforeseen threats, which could negate any savings from reducing nondeployed warheads. Additionally, they argue that adjusting costs and savings for net present value would further delay reaching a point of cost efficiency. Advocates of LEP question the potential cost savings of the RRW program, expressing concerns about the large investment costs and uncertainty about when any savings might offset these costs. They argue that RRW maintenance costs would be significant if RRW had birth defects. Cost will be a critical factor in the decision-making process. The decision on LEP or RRW will be influenced by cost, with questions about the validity of long-term projections. The cost section of the RRW report mandated by Congress will be important. Various issues affecting the future of the U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise are discussed, along with questions for Congress to consider. The U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise has multiple goals, including reliability, longevity, safety, security, and ease of manufacture. Achieving these goals comes with costs and design constraints. Congress may need to consider tradeoffs in safety and use control features in warhead design. The benefits of certain design choices should be questioned, and alternative means to achieve them should be explored. Congress should review key design tradeoffs and assess if current warheads are sufficient. Congress may need to review key design tradeoffs in warhead design, including safety and use control features. The Department of Defense is split in its support for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), with the U.S. Strategic Command strongly endorsing it as a key to transforming aging nuclear weapons infrastructure. General James Cartwright, USMC, Commander of USSTRATCOM, testified in 2006 in support of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) to enhance confidence in the aging nuclear weapons stockpile. Concerns include potential changes to handling procedures and links between missile and warhead. RRW advocates argue that it will reduce long-term burden compared to Life Extension Programs (LEPs). Congress may need to determine DOD leadership's current support for RRW. Advocates of Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) believe it will provide high confidence in the nuclear stockpile by staying within parameters defined by nuclear test data. On the other hand, advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) argue that current warheads have extensive test pedigrees and can be extended by 20 to 30 years. Some believe that neither LEP nor RRW can provide confidence without nuclear testing, while others suggest a mixed RRW-LEP force could maintain weapons for the long term. A mixed RRW-LEP force would be necessary for some years if the US moved to an all-RRW stockpile to lower the risk of a single failure jeopardizing the entire stockpile. Congress should consider methods for maintaining a reliable stockpile, challenges of deploying a mixed LEP/RRW force, and the implications of maintaining a test moratorium or resuming testing. The current warhead designs are preliminary, with potential manufacturing difficulties and design defects. The plutonium pit, a crucial component, is costly and challenging to make. The plutonium shell is a costly and difficult pit component to make, with production currently taking place at LANL's Technical Area 55. NNSA plans to increase production capacity to 50 certified pits per year by FY2012. Pit life is a factor in choosing between RRW and LEP, with recent studies extending the estimated pit life considerably. The JASON scientific advisory group reviewed an assessment of pit life by LANL and LLNL, finding no degradation in performance of primaries of stockpile systems due to plutonium aging. Most primary types have credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years, with clear mitigation paths for those with assessed minimum lifetimes of 100 years or less. Extending pit life would benefit LEP, as current warheads are costly to build and certify without nuclear testing. High confidence in life-extended warheads could reduce the need for manufacturing new pits for many decades. The Department of Defense (DOD) could have high confidence in life-extended warheads, reducing the need for manufacturing new pits for many decades. Congress grappled with the issue of pit production capacity and the need for a new production facility, with NNSA advocating for a Consolidated Plutonium Center (CPC) with a capacity of 125 pits per year despite longer pit lifetimes. Despite the findings on pit life, there is a need for substantial production capacity to replace pits in stockpiled warheads and introduce RRW warheads by 2030. Even with longer lifetimes, pit replacement is necessary, and RRW designs would require new pit manufacture. An adverse change in the threat environment could also necessitate rapid warhead production and deployment. LEP supporters challenge these points, citing the potential longevity of current warheads and the slow pace of RRW deployment with limited pit production. The debate over the need for a new pit facility revolves around the pace of RRW deployment and the potential benefits of LEP. Supporters of LEP argue that existing warheads can be maintained with LEP and Stockpile Systems programs, avoiding the need for RRW and a new pit facility. They believe this approach reduces costs and risks, outweighing the benefits of having fewer nondeployed warheads. RRW supporters, on the other hand, argue that a new pit facility would allow for the production of multiple pit types and enable faster warhead production in response to potential threats. RRW supporters argue that a new pit facility would provide more capacity for producing multiple pit types simultaneously, allowing for quicker response to problems and threats. They believe it would be more cost-effective to build a new facility than to upgrade the existing one, as the current facility may struggle to meet safety and security requirements. Additionally, they emphasize the critical need for pit production capacity for RRW deployment, as using certified pits from retired warheads would expedite the introduction of new warheads. RRW supporters argue that using certified pits from retired warheads in RRWs would allow for faster deployment, even if using PF-4 or CPC. LANL considered pit reuse beneficial for RRWs to avoid production issues and save money. However, pit reuse was ruled out for missile warheads due to design limitations and certification challenges. Reusing pits may be feasible for RRW bombs, as they offer more design flexibility. Thomas D'Agostino mentioned examining stored pits for potential use in future RRWs. Examining stored pits for potential use in future reliable replacement warhead concepts is being considered. Some opponents suggest increasing PF-4's capacity beyond 50 pits per year by reconfiguring equipment. Reusing certified pits from retired warheads could offset expenses and speed up deployment, especially for bombs, but not for missile warheads due to design constraints. Reconfiguring the pilot project for larger-scale production may require suspending pit production. Warheads in the stockpile have had unanticipated problems, similar to recalls with cars and laptop batteries. Significant Finding Investigations (SFIs) address defects found during warhead surveillance, with some defects discovered one to two decades after production. Congress may inquire about these issues. The report discusses potential defects in warheads, questioning the need for deploying new warheads like RRW when current ones have had issues. It raises concerns about the reliability of new designs and the possibility of undiscovered defects in aging warheads. Congress may request an update on SFIs and surveillance to ensure all defects are addressed. The Appendix provides an overview of nuclear weapons design, focusing on the two-stage design of current strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. It explains the primary stage, which contains a pit with fissile material surrounded by explosive material for implosion. The implosion triggers a chain reaction in the plutonium, sustained by neutron injection, leading to a brief nuclear explosion. The nuclear explosive package consists of the primary, radiation case, and secondary components, with the primary stage triggering a chain reaction in the plutonium. Boost gas is injected to increase fission yield, while fusion reactions generate neutrons to boost the chain reaction. The secondary stage releases most of the energy in a nuclear explosion. Thousands of nonnuclear components are also needed to make the weapon usable. The nuclear weapons complex consists of eight government-owned contractor-operated sites responsible for designing, testing, and manufacturing nuclear weapons. These sites are involved in disassembly, inspection, and refurbishment of existing nuclear weapons. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) oversees these activities. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages the nuclear weapons complex and program, maintaining nuclear weapons through the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). SSP aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise with advanced computational capabilities, above-ground experiments, and large experimental facilities. SSP includes Directed Stockpile Work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, Campaigns providing scientific and engineering expertise, and programs like the Life Extension Program and RRW program. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the nuclear weapons complex and program through the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP), which aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise. The SSP includes Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns providing scientific and engineering expertise, and programs like the Life Extension Program and RRW program. Congressional goals have been set for the RRW program to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program, with $9.0 million allocated, aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of US nuclear weapons stockpile while reducing the need for underground nuclear weapons testing. Congressional requirements for the program include maintaining basic design parameters and utilizing well-understood or certifiable components. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile by using well-understood components. The program also seeks to reduce the need for underground nuclear weapons testing and achieve reductions in the size of the stockpile. The House Armed Services Committee has set goals for the program, including designing and replacing components to fulfill current mission requirements. The Armed Services Committee has set goals for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, including focusing on replacing warheads for Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles and reducing the likelihood of nuclear testing. The program also aims to address the loss of expertise in the nuclear complex by training and sustaining weapons designers and engineers. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile by developing replacement components with more easily manufactured materials. It also aims to reduce the need for nuclear testing, decrease infrastructure costs, and increase confidence in the stockpile. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile by developing replacement components with more easily manufactured materials. The program also aims to reduce infrastructure costs, increase responsiveness, and achieve the smallest stockpile consistent with national security goals. Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee support the program if it eliminates the need for nuclear testing, leads to reductions in the nuclear arsenal, and does not introduce new weapon requirements. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons, decrease costs, enhance security, and support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The House Appropriations Committee supports the program for its potential to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and reduce the stockpile without the need for nuclear testing. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to transition the weapons complex to a more efficient modern system by phasing out redundant Cold War warhead designs. The program is endorsed as a re-engineered and remanufactured warhead for existing stockpiles, not for new weapon designs or military missions beyond current deterrent requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee's report on FY2006 energy and water development appropriations highlighted the goals of the RRW Program to explore the use of more easily manufacturable and environmentally friendly materials for replacement components of existing stockpile weapons. The program aims to ensure safety and reliability without nuclear testing, reduce life-cycle costs, and maintain the long-term sustainability of the legacy stockpile. The FY2006 energy and water conference report emphasized that any weapon design work under the RRW program must align with military requirements and past nuclear test parameters. The NNSA is expected to improve manufacturing practices, lower costs, and increase performance margins to support the Administration's decision to reduce the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The FY2007 committee reports did not add requirements for RRW design."
