    "content": "The \"Farmers Tax Deferral Act\" allows for nontaxable exchange of qualified agricultural property for real property under section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. No gain or loss is recognized for a qualified person receiving US real property in exchange for qualified agricultural property. A qualified person is an individual aged 55 or older, a corporation wholly owned by such individuals, or a partnership/trust/estate wholly owned by such individuals. Qualified agricultural property includes agricultural structures in service for over 20 years before the exchange. For tax purposes, US real property refers to property located in the United States. To qualify for a tax-deferred exchange, the exchanged property must be identified within 45 days and the exchange completed within 180 days. This applies to structures in service for over 20 years and related real property, equipment, or fixtures. The taxpayer must transfer the relinquished property within 180 days or by the due date of their tax return. Rules similar to section 1031 apply, and the transaction is treated as a section 1031 exchange for tax purposes. Additionally, there is a special rule for like-kind exchanges of qualified agricultural property. The taxpayer must transfer the relinquished property within 180 days or by the due date of their tax return. Rules similar to section 1031 apply, and the transaction is treated as a section 1031 exchange for tax purposes. A special rule applies for like-kind exchanges of qualified agricultural property, limiting the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor. When United States real property acquired in an exchange is disposed of, the transferee may have to recapture ordinary income. This involves calculating the excess of the amount realized on the disposition over the adjusted basis of the property. If the property is sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted, the fair market value is used instead of the amount realized. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to transfers after the enactment date, while the amendments made by subsection (b) apply to dispositions after the enactment date. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULES FOR INSTALLMENT SALES OF QUALIFIED AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY. Special rule for qualified agricultural property under subsection (i) of section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows income from installment sales to be recognized under the installment method, with recapture income recognized in the same proportion as aggregate recapture income from the sale. The amendments made by this section apply to sales after the enactment of this Act, with a conforming amendment to section 453(i) of the Internal Revenue Code."
