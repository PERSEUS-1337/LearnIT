    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2011\". Congress finds that breast cancer accounts for a significant portion of cancer diagnoses among women, with disparities in survival rates between White and African-American women. Early detection is crucial for increasing survival rates, especially for triple-negative breast cancer, which affects a percentage of female patients. Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer that affects women under 50, with a higher prevalence in African-American and Hispanic women. African-American women are three times more likely to develop this type of cancer compared to White women. Early detection is crucial for survival as the tumor cells lack certain proteins. Treatment includes surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer is crucial for survival as hormone therapy and targeted drugs are ineffective. Research lacks information on prevalence rates, treatment costs, and prevention methods for African-American, Hispanic, and other minority women with this type of cancer. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand research programs for triple-negative breast cancer. The research will be coordinated through various institutes and centers, with a focus on minority health disparities. $500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2015 for this purpose. Education and dissemination of information regarding triple-negative breast cancer will be emphasized. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on triple-negative breast cancer, focusing on its incidence among women, higher risk for minority women, and available treatment options. Information may be disseminated through various channels, and funding is authorized for fiscal years 2013-2015. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on triple-negative breast cancer to healthcare providers, emphasizing the elevated risk for minority women and treatment options. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2013-2017. The term \"minority women\" refers to women from racial and ethnic minority groups."
