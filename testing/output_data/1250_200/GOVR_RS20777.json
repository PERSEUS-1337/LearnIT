    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005, surpassing 2 million before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 took effect. Filings dropped sharply in 2006 due to the new law, but rose steadily until 2010. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being the major components. Consumer credit makes up about 97% of household indebtedness, consisting of revolving credit like credit card debt and non-revolving debt such as auto and college loans. Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. The burden of debt service, the percentage of household income used to repay loans, fluctuates between 10.80% to 13.93%. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden since the 1980s, it does not fully explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades. The increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades has not been accompanied by a significant reduction in bankruptcy rates, despite a decline in the debt service ratio since 2007. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have decreased to historically low levels, leading to a rise in the ratio of debt outstanding to income. This suggests that further increases in bankruptcy filings may occur if interest rates rise suddenly. The aggregate household debt numbers hide differences among families, with some benefiting from the declining interest rates since 1980. The data from Table 3 based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that lower-income families are most likely to file for bankruptcy due to high levels of debt. Despite a notable increase in bankruptcy filings among upper-income families in 2007, the overall percentage of families in distress remained relatively unchanged since 1998. The question remains why many families at or below the national median income take on excessive debt. The rise in consumer bankruptcy filings remains controversial, with various explanations including high levels of debt taken on during the housing boom and the impact of marketing strategies by credit card issuers. The U.S. economy went into recession in December 2007, leading to a decline in household debt levels for 11 quarters before a slight increase in the second quarter of 2011. Debt balances fell in three out of four categories, with declines continuing for 11 quarters until a slight increase in the second quarter of 2011. Home equity and credit card debt led the decline on a percentage basis, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. Factors contributing to the fall include households paying down debt, borrowing less, increased debt write-offs by lenders, tightened credit standards, mortgage modifications, and foreclosures."
