    "content": "In 1891, Congress granted the President the authority to establish forest reserves from the public domain. Six years later, Congress stated that the reserves were to improve and protect the forest, secure water flows, and provide timber for US citizens. The reserves were initially administered by the Division of Forestry in the General Land Office, then transferred to the USDA Bureau of Forestry (Forest Service) in 1905. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the reserves in 1906 and 1907, leading Congress to limit the President's authority to add to the system in certain states. In 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act to authorize additions to the National Forest System (NFS) through the purchase of private lands. The NFS has grown slowly from 154 million acres in 1919 to 193 million acres in 2014 through purchases, donations, and land transfers. It includes 154 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and 108 other areas. Each national forest unit is administered by a forest supervisor, organized into nine administrative regions headed by a regional forester. Presidential authority to proclaim new national forests was terminated in 1976. The National Forest System (NFS) is divided into nine administrative regions, each overseen by a regional forester. The regional foresters report to the NFS deputy chief, who in turn reports to the chief of the Forest Service. The chief reports to the USDA Secretary through the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment. NFS lands are mainly concentrated in the seven western FS regions, with inholdings (primarily private lands) posing challenges for FS land management. The National Forest System is managed for multiple uses, including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. Private landowners may object to federal restrictions on their lands, impacting access to federal lands. Wilderness areas are consistent with the management goals outlined in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The National Forest System is managed for multiple uses, with a focus on sustained yield and coordination of resources. Laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act apply to federal agencies like the Forest Service. Planning and management are guided by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act and the National Forest Management Act, which promote long-term resource planning and assessment. NFMA requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each NFS unit. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires the Forest Service to prepare land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit every 10 to 15 years. These plans must use an interdisciplinary approach, involve public input, and comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The planning rules have been revised multiple times since 1979, with each presidential administration making changes. The Clinton Administration's 2000 planning rule aimed to increase emphasis on ecological sustainability, but implementation was delayed by the George W. Bush Administration. The George W. Bush Administration delayed and replaced the Clinton regulations with the 2005 planning rule, which aimed to balance ecological sustainability with economic and social considerations. However, the rule was challenged for reducing environmental protection without proper public comment and ESA consideration. The 2008 planning rule was invalidated for violating NEPA and ESA, leading to a reversion to 1982 procedures. The Obama Administration then introduced the 2012 planning rule, emphasizing ecological sustainability, landscape-scale restoration, and science-based planning. The 2012 planning rule for the National Forest System (NFS) emphasizes ecological sustainability, landscape-scale restoration, and science-based decisions. Logging, ranching, and off-highway vehicle groups have challenged the rule in lawsuits. The NFS lands are managed for multiple uses including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, fish, wilderness, and mineral extraction. The National Forest System (NFS) lands are managed for multiple uses including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, fish, wilderness, and mineral extraction. Revenue generated from these uses may offset agency costs, benefit communities, or be deposited into the General Treasury. In FY2014, the FS generated $242.2 million in revenue, with recreation being the largest source followed by timber-related activities. In FY2014, the Forest Service generated $242.2 million in revenue, with timber-related activities such as KV sales, salvage sales, and timber production accounting for nearly half of the total revenue. Initially, the agency aimed to be self-supporting through timber production, but timber sales only increased significantly in the 1950s due to the post-World War II housing boom. Despite being a major timber provider for the wood products industry, FS timber harvests have significantly declined since the 1990s. Since the 1990s, Forest Service timber harvests have fallen to around 2 billion board feet annually, a quarter of historic levels. Factors contributing to this decline include changing legislative directives, market dynamics, and the drop in lumber prices starting in FY2005. Despite this, there has been a slight increase in harvest volume in recent years, with FY2015 seeing the largest production since FY2000 at 2.5 billion board feet, generating $162.7 million in revenue. The Forest Service is increasingly using timber harvests to achieve land and resource management objectives. The Forest Service has been using timber harvests to achieve land and resource management objectives since FY2000, generating $162.7 million in revenue. They also engage in stewardship contracts with private parties for activities like thinning and salvage harvesting to facilitate forest restoration. Outdoor recreation is popular in national forests, with over 166 million annual visits for various activities. The Forest Service generates revenue through timber harvests and stewardship contracts for forest restoration. Outdoor recreation, such as wildlife viewing, hiking, camping, skiing, and horseback riding, is popular in national forests. Controversy surrounds some recreational uses like off-highway vehicles and snowmobiles. The agency is managing recreation through a travel management planning process to designate motorized use areas. Recreation on NFS lands also generates significant revenue, with receipts totaling $72.0 million in FY2014. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a recreation fee program for the Forest Service in 2004, which was extended until September 30, 2016. Congress may consider allowing the program to sunset or extending it with modifications. The National Forest System contains important ecological, recreational, economic, and cultural resources enjoyed by recreational users. The National Forest System (NFS) contains a variety of wildlife and over 400 threatened or endangered species. The FS issues permits for grazing livestock on NFS lands, with fees set at $2.11 per head month. Grazing levels have slowly declined, with BLM lands providing more grazing than national forests. Protecting watershed health is a key purpose of the national forests. Protecting watershed health is a key purpose of the national forests, with nearly one-fifth of the nation's water originating from NFS lands. The Watershed Condition Framework assesses and prioritizes the conditions of 15,000 watersheds on NFS lands, with 52% classified as good, 45% as fair, and 4% as poor. Watershed restoration activities include improving stream habitat and decommissioning roads. Congress has provided management direction within the NFS for watershed management. The National Forest Service focuses on protecting watershed health, with activities such as improving stream habitat and decommissioning roads. Congress has created special designations for certain areas within the NFS, including wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails. These designations restrict resource development and use, with specific guidance provided for each designation. Management of FS roadless areas, which have not been designated as wilderness by Congress, remains controversial. The National Forest Service manages roadless areas to protect wilderness characteristics, with debates over prohibiting or permitting certain uses. President Clinton's roadless rule faced legal challenges but remains intact. NFS lands are used for various purposes like electricity transmission and recreation through special use authorizations. Mineral and energy exploration on NFS lands are governed by the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil, natural gas, and coal exploration on NFS lands. Approximately 5.6 million acres are leased for energy operations, with 4,200 federal oil and gas wells and 25% of the nation's coal production coming from NFS land. The FS also manages 160,000 mining claims, with receipts collected by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. A moratorium on new coal leases was announced in 2016, while renewable energy projects like solar and wind are allowed on NFS lands through special use authorizations. Since 2000, discussions on FS management have focused on catastrophic wildfires, exacerbated by biomass accumulations, drought, and climate change. Advocates propose actions like prescribed burning and thinning to improve forest resilience and protect nearby lands and homes. Critics argue against authorities to reduce risks. The Forest Service focuses on forest resilience through prescribed burning, thinning, and salvaging dead trees to protect NFS forests and nearby areas. Critics argue that treatments removing commercial timber harm forest health and waste taxpayer money. The FS receives discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with $7.06 billion in total funding in FY2016, primarily from discretionary funds. The NFS received $1.51 billion in discretionary funds in FY2016, accounting for 28% of FS discretionary appropriations. Funds are allocated to regions, programs, and national forests, making analysis challenging. The NFS received $1.51 billion in discretionary funds in FY2016, with funds allocated to regions, programs, and national forests. Analyzing appropriations by region or forest can be challenging due to the various subaccounts, programs, and activities within the NFS. The largest subaccount is Forest Products, which funds the Timber Sale program. Other subaccounts include Land Management Planning, Inventory and Monitoring, and Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness, each funding specific activities related to forest management and conservation. In FY2016, the NFS received $1.51 billion in discretionary funds, with allocations for various programs. Forest Products, Grazing Management, Vegetation and Watershed Management, Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management, and Recreation are key areas funded within the NFS. These funds support activities such as timber sales, livestock grazing permits, restoration management, and wildlife habitat maintenance. The NFS received $1.51 billion in discretionary funds in FY2016, with allocations for various programs including Forest Products, Grazing Management, Vegetation and Watershed Management, Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management, and Recreation. Funding for specific programs includes Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration, Minerals and Geology Management, Landownership Management, and Law Enforcement Operations on NFS lands. The FS proposed a new budget structure for the NFS account by combining restoration-focused work into one budget line item, Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR), in FY2011. Congress authorized up to $68 million transferred from other NFS subaccounts to implement the IRR as a pilot program in FY2012. The pilot was authorized to be conducted in three regions (1, 3, and 4) with no specified sunset date. Implementation of the program began late in FY2012. The pilot IRR program, authorized in FY2012 with no specified sunset date, has been implemented with continued funding through FY2016. Congress may decide to expand the IRR across the NFS, continue the pilot in three regions, discontinue it, or propose modifications to the NFS discretionary account structure. Proponents argue that the budget flexibility improves land and resource management for wildfire prevention and forest resilience, while critics fear reduced congressional oversight. The FS manages wildfire activities on NFS lands through the Wildland Fire Management account and the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund. The Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund on NFS lands receive significant appropriations, totaling $3.9 billion in FY2016. Suppression activities, preparedness, and hazardous fuels are the main recipients of WFM funds, with some funds allocated to research assistance programs. The FS is authorized to transfer money from other accounts for fire control activities due to their emergency nature. The FS is authorized to transfer money from other discretionary accounts for fire control activities. Congress has appropriated additional funding for wildfire suppression, expressing concerns about the increasing portion of the FS budget going toward suppression funding. Options for financing suppression activities have been considered, including proposals to provide funds outside of statutory constraints. Presidential authority to reserve lands as forest reserves was limited by Congress in 1891. The Secretary of Agriculture has various authorities to add lands to the National Forest System (NFS), with the primary authority granted by the Weeks Act of 1911. This act allows the purchase of forested lands for regulating stream flow and timber production. The Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 also authorizes the acquisition of submarginal and uncultivable lands. The Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 authorized the acquisition of submarginal and uncultivable lands for the National Forest System. The Secretary of Agriculture has various authorities to add lands to the NFS, including acquiring access corridors and disposing of lands better suited for other uses. Additional laws like the 1897 Organic Act and the 1911 Weeks Act also allow for land disposal or transfer for specific purposes. The 1983 Small Tracts Act allows the Secretary to dispose of certain lands valued at $150,000 or less by sale or exchange. Congress authorized the transfer of up to 80 acres of NFS land to public school districts for a nominal cost, with the condition that the lands must be used for educational purposes. Current debates on NFS management focus on issues like land and resource allocation, balancing demands for commodity and non-commodity uses, and increased public interest in resource allocation decisions. The debates surrounding NFS management revolve around the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. Congress initially granted the FS discretion in making these decisions, but as concerns grew, legislation was enacted to specify certain land uses. Congress has not directly addressed the concepts of multiple use or sustained yield in legislation, leading to conflicts as users and land managers try to balance various uses and produce a sustained yield of resources from national forests. Legislation has been considered to prioritize timber production or recreation, hunting, and fishing over other uses. Ongoing concerns include wildfire management costs, strategies, and impacts on communities and the economy. Fire control expenditures are rising, affecting the implementation of other programs in national forests. Fire control expenditures are increasing, impacting national forest uses through personnel and funds transferred to fire control. The containment of this cost spiral remains uncertain."
