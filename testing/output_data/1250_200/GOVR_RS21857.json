Foreign investors from developed and developing economies have invested in various U.S. industries. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy is predominantly from developed economies, with investments mainly in the manufacturing sector. In 2015, these investments were valued at $1.2 trillion, representing one-third of all foreign direct investment. The finance, insurance, wholesale trade, information, and banking sectors also received significant foreign direct investment. Within the manufacturing sector, investments are concentrated in the chemicals and transport sectors, with robust labor productivity compared to other sectors in the U.S. economy. Estimates show robust labor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector compared to other sectors and advanced economies. From 1993 to 2010, labor productivity doubled in manufacturing, while nonfarm business labor productivity increased by 50%. U.S. unit labor costs decreased by 15% from 2002 to 2011, while rising in 18 other countries.

Acquisitions also accounted for 99% of employment associated with foreign investment. U.S. foreign investment policy has historically supported foreign direct investment, with national security concerns becoming more prominent in recent years. Over the past decade, national security concerns have led to increased restrictions on foreign investment in various countries. The United States addresses these concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investment transactions to assess their impact on national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews foreign investment transactions to determine if they threaten national security, involve foreign government control, or impact critical infrastructure. The President can block transactions that pose a threat. CFIUS reported that 42% of notified transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in the manufacturing sector, with investments in finance, information, and services sectors also common. Within manufacturing, computer and electronic products sectors saw the most transactions. Investment transactions notified to CFIUS show that 40% were in computer and electronic products sectors, followed by transportation equipment and machinery sectors. Concerns arise over the international presence of state-owned enterprises, with 22% of the world's largest firms under state control. Policymakers worry about preferential treatment given to SOEs, potentially creating anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) with close associations to governments may have anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. This could provide firms with market protection and financing advantages, blurring the line between commercial and government-driven activities. Concerns exist about SOEs compromising national security objectives through foreign investments. However, the OECD has found little evidence that SOEs' advantages impact their international economic performance. The OECD found little evidence that state-owned enterprises' advantages affect their international economic performance. In 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with 32,000 foreign affiliates, while foreign firms had 6,600 affiliates in the U.S. U.S. parent companies employed 26 million workers in the U.S. and 13.8 million abroad. U.S. parent companies were more efficient and paid 80% more in aggregate employee compensation in the U.S. compared to foreign affiliates. The data shows that U.S. parent companies are more efficient than U.S. affiliates of U.S. firms or foreign firms in the U.S., with higher output per employee. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive, while U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have higher gross output.

Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy has increased significantly since 1980, reaching 6.4% of GDP. Foreign-owned firms in the United States have historically had lower rates of return compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap is narrowing over time due to age effects. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms outperform their U.S. counterparts, with significantly higher value added and shipments. Foreign-owned firms account for less than 3% of all U.S. manufacturing establishments but have larger average plant sizes. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the United States have larger average plant sizes, pay higher wages, and have higher productivity and output per worker compared to U.S.-owned firms. They also display higher capital intensity in a larger number of industries. These differences should be viewed with caution due to the varying sizes and factors between the two groups of firms. Foreign direct investment in the United States in 2015 increased significantly, driven by a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows rose by 38% to $1.7 trillion in 2015, although they have not yet reached pre-financial crisis levels. Foreign firms investing in the U.S. tend to be larger with proven technologies, opting for higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. Small foreign ventures with unproven technologies are less likely to invest overseas. Global foreign direct investment flows have not fully recovered from pre-financial crisis levels, with a slowdown in inflows seen in Africa and parts of Latin America in 2015. The U.S. economy's growth rate relative to other advanced economies, low interest rates, and stable inflation may lead to an increase in foreign direct investment in the United States. Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and potential job losses from mergers are key factors influencing public perception of foreign direct investment. The concerns about foreign direct investment in the United States stem from potential job losses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, regardless of whether the acquiring company is foreign or U.S.-owned. Job security is a significant public issue, with opposition also driven by worries about the impact on U.S. economic and national security interests. Despite these concerns, the U.S. economy remains a top destination for foreign direct investment, with the potential for increased investment as the nation's economic growth outpaces that of other countries. As the U.S. economy outpaces foreign economies, foreign direct investment is likely to increase, attracting new investments and encouraging existing firms to reinvest in their U.S. operations."
