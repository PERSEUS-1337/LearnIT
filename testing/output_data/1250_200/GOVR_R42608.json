A panel of banks is surveyed daily to determine rates, with averages reported at 11:30 a.m. There are separate LIBOR rates for 15 maturities and 10 currencies. In the U.S., contracts often reference the three-month dollar LIBOR, based on rates from a panel of 18 banks including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The dollar LIBOR is determined by a panel of 18 banks, including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The highest 4 and lowest 4 responses are discarded, and the middle 10 are averaged. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, with criteria based on market share, reputation, and expertise. Similar indexes exist for other locations, such as EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo, measuring the cost of borrowing funds in different currencies and maturities. The LIBOR index is used as a benchmark for various loans and financial derivatives. It is also used by policymakers and futures exchanges. Private parties voluntarily choose to use LIBOR as a benchmark, considering their cost of funds for future loans. The interest rate for a future loan may be based on the LIBOR index, which represents the cost of borrowing dollars by major banks. Other benchmarks like U.S. Treasury yields or the Federal Funds Rate exist but may not always align with banks' borrowing costs. The LIBOR index is widely used as a benchmark for loans and financial instruments, with a significant impact on adjustable rate mortgages and municipal contracts. Despite the belief that a single bank on the reporting panel cannot influence the index, it can still have an effect on it. A single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can affect the index, but may not always move it in the desired direction. The dollar LIBOR is calculated by averaging the middle 10 responses out of 18 banks. If a bank changes its response to lower the LIBOR, it can impact the final index. A single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index by adjusting its response. By lowering its bid from 10% to below 8%, the bank can impact the average rate. However, there is a limit to the magnitude of this effect, as changing the response may not always achieve the desired manipulation due to the fixed number of middle responses used in the calculation. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate LIBOR, which is used in U.S. derivatives markets. This manipulation is a violation of U.S. law, and Barclays settled separately with UK officials for violating UK law. The settlement documents with the CFTC and DOJ include employee emails documenting manipulation in three categories: changing survey responses for trade positions, protecting reputation, and inducing other banks to change responses. These actions can affect LIBOR. During 2005-2007, Barclays' internal emails reveal derivatives traders asking other employees to submit false survey responses to benefit their trading positions. Unlike many other divisions within Barclays, the derivatives traders' preferred LIBOR outcome changes direction from day to day. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses for LIBOR during 2005-2007. As financial markets faced stress in 2008, Barclays' management wanted to lower responses to protect the firm's reputation. UK regulators raised concerns about Barclays' higher survey responses. Barclays' LIBOR survey responses drew the attention of UK officials and financial regulators, who raised concerns about the firm's high submissions. Some Barclays employees believed UK officials wanted lower LIBOR responses, despite managers denying this. In 2008, Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also raised concerns about Barclays' LIBOR responses and the methodology for the index. Congressional inquiries revealed FRBNY's concerns with how LIBOR was calculated and reported in 2008. In 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) expressed concerns about the calculation and reporting of the LIBOR index. Documents revealed FRBNY's worries, including presentations to the U.S. Treasury and emails between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King regarding enhancing LIBOR's credibility."
