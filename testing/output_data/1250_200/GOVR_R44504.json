    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and approval by the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. The NEPA requires a programmatic planning process. The BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. The program includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA, addressing potential impacts and considering alternatives. Public comments are incorporated into both the PEIS and the program itself. The program cannot be revised once finalized, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. The final version of the oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. The program includes 11 lease sales on the OCS, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Congress plays a role in the planning process, although they do not have approval authority. Members of Congress can influence the program by submitting public comments during formal comment periods. Members of Congress can influence the proposed offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 by submitting public comments, participating in oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program. Congress's role in oversight and legislation related to the program is also highlighted. In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA to address jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of subsurface oil and natural gas exploration. The OCSLA aims for expedited development of OCS resources while maintaining environmental safeguards and national needs. Congress sought to balance energy goals with environmental protection, state and local government involvement, and a competitive leasing process for offshore activities. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18 mandating the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. These programs, starting in 1980, set schedules for lease auctions and have guided OCS oil and gas exploration. Subsequent legislation like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 have further shaped offshore oil and gas exploration and production. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions for oil and gas exploration, sharing revenues with Gulf states. Congress removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions from 2008 onwards, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA, mandating the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and revise an oil and gas leasing program. The leasing program under the OCSLA considers economic, social, and environmental values, directing the Secretary to schedule oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws and policies. The OCSLA requires a balance between economic, social, and environmental factors in offshore exploration. Leasing must ensure fair market value and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation with federal agencies, governors, and local officials is mandatory. The proposed program must be submitted to affected state governors for comments at least 60 days prior to publication. The OCSLA requires a proposed program to be submitted to affected state governors for comments at least 60 days prior to publication. The Secretary must also submit the program to Congress and the President for approval, with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary can revise the five-year program at any time, with significant revisions requiring the same approval process. BOEM carries out the Secretary's responsibilities for the five-year program. The OCSLA mandates that the Secretary of the Interior submits a proposed five-year program to affected state governors for comments before publication. BOEM is responsible for carrying out the Secretary's duties regarding the program. Regulations require BOEM to consult with governors and publish the proposed program in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that also influence the program's formation, with NEPA requiring detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions. The process for compliance with the requirement includes an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an action significantly affects the environment. If the proposed action is deemed major without an EA, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared. BOEM assumes the significance of its five-year programs' impact on the environment and prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) alongside the program. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires state programs to designate conservation measures and permissible land and water uses, address water pollution sources, and ensure federal compliance. BOEM regulations consider state coastal management programs in developing leasing programs, requesting input from governors and the Secretary of Commerce. The five-year program development process involves multiple drafts for review and comment by state governors and federal agencies. The five-year program development process involves multiple drafts published for review and comment by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step includes public comment and environmental review, leading to a winnowing process to develop an initial schedule of proposed lease sales. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) initiates the development of a new five-year program by requesting information from interested parties regarding energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The process involves multiple drafts, public input, and environmental reviews to develop an initial schedule of proposed lease sales. The agency may remove proposed sales but cannot add new ones without reverting to an earlier stage of the process. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, which includes a preliminary list of areas proposed for lease sales over the next five years. The DPP also initiates a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and seeks public input on the issues to be analyzed in the PEIS. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, initiating a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and seeking public input on the issues to be analyzed. The proposed program (PP) refines the locations and timing for OCS oil and gas lease sales, with a draft PEIS analyzing the identified areas. The final document published by BOEM is the Proposed Final Program (PFP), based on additional analysis of the factors in Section 18 of the OCSLA. The draft PEIS closed on May 2, 2016. The final document published by BOEM is the Proposed Final Program (PFP), which is based on additional analysis of factors in the OCSLA and public comments. The PFP is submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, and it becomes final with a record of decision published. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell approved the final program for 2017-2022 on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, each reflecting different offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The 2012-2017 program, submitted by the Obama Administration under former Secretary Ken Salazar, included 15 proposed lease sales in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The 2007-2012 five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration and later revised by the Obama Administration. It included 21 sales initially, which were later reduced to 16 sales. The program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program had 16 sales, with 12 held before expiring in June 2002. The 1992-1997 program included 18 sales, with 12 held before expiring in June 1997. The 1987-1992 program had a schedule of sales presented to Congress in 1987. The 1980-1982 program for domestic oil and gas leasing was presented to Congress in 1980 under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus. It included 36 proposed sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1982. The 1980-1982 domestic oil and gas leasing program, proposed by former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, included 36 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1982. In November 2016, BOEM released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The program covers four OCS regions: Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific, with lease sales planned in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production declined from 31% to 16% of total production between FY2010 and FY2015, while offshore natural gas production fell from 9.5% to 4%. In contrast, total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production increased significantly due to shale gas and shale oil production in onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford, reducing the need for imports. The increased U.S. oil production from onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. Onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays offshore. There are 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with most located in the Central Gulf of Mexico. Lower oil and gas prices may impact future offshore lease acquisition and production levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects decreased domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020. ONRR estimates lower bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) projects a significant decrease in offshore bonus bid revenues over the next five fiscal years compared to previous periods. The decline is attributed to lower crude oil prices, impacting new investment. Despite this, federal offshore crude oil production, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to reach record levels in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including continued oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains a key focus according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) emphasizes the importance of energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil and gas exploration proceed in stages, with reserves reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reserves have been reported in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, parts of the California coast, and Alaska OCS, but no reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. BOEM estimates 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas in undiscovered resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. Alaska's UTRR estimates are concentrated in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM considers resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when planning OCS leasing. Some areas were not available for leasing in the 2017-2022 program. Some portions of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. Unavailable areas included Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, Alaska Withdrawal Areas, and National Marine Sanctuaries and Marine Monuments. In December 2016, President Obama withdrew significant portions of the U.S. Arctic, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea planning areas, from future oil and gas leasing activities. This also included certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean and North Bering Sea. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program but would affect future five-year programs. President Obama withdrew areas in the U.S. Arctic and Atlantic from future oil and gas leasing. This would impact future five-year programs, but not the 2017-2022 leasing program. BOEM's leasing strategy considers various factors for each U.S. ocean region. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales in the Atlantic or Pacific regions. Some proposed lease sales were not included in the program. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS, with the majority of lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico region. The Gulf region is the most mature and accounts for 97% of U.S. offshore production. The region includes the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf planning areas, with most sales proposed in the Gulf region. The 2017-2022 leasing program under GOMESA replaces area-specific sales with region-wide sales in the Gulf of Mexico, offering all available lease blocks in each sale. This change aims to provide greater flexibility to industry and facilitate better planning for exploring resources. The final program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous programs, which has raised concerns among some Members of Congress. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for longer drilling seasons. Despite substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters, challenges like severe weather, sea ice, and lack of infrastructure persist. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with federal leases, with only the Beaufort Sea having producing wells. Stakeholders aim to expand exploration efforts. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are divided on expanding offshore oil and gas activities in the Arctic. The Obama Administration supported exploration but also focused on safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Lease sales in the Alaska region were planned but canceled due to market conditions and low industry interest. For the 2017-2022 offshore oil and gas leasing program, BOEM initially planned lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet. However, sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas were removed in the final program, with only the Cook Inlet sale retained. This decision was based on factors such as existing leases, Arctic ecosystem concerns, industry interest decline, and market conditions. BOEM noted Shell Oil Company's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015 as a contributing factor to the reduced interest in Arctic OCS exploration. The Arctic OCS saw a significant decline in active leases due to low oil prices and Shell Oil Company's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. Industry interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas is expected to increase post-2017-2022. President Obama withdrew parts of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration indefinitely. The final 2017-2022 program excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region. The final 2017-2022 program excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region, which was proposed in the DPP version. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria had prevented oil and gas activity in the Atlantic for 30 years, but changes in 2009 allowed for potential lease sales. However, as of December 2016, certain parts of the Atlantic are under presidential moratorium, while other areas remain available for leasing. The final 2017-2022 program excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region due to strong local opposition, conflicts with existing ocean uses, current market dynamics, and feedback from Governors of affected states. BOEM initially planned a lease sale in a combined portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021 but removed it in the final program. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to conflicts with existing ocean uses, strong local opposition, and feedback from Governors of affected states. The agency noted that the Atlantic region lacks a history of offshore mineral production, unlike the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, the increase in onshore oil and gas production over the past decade has made national energy needs less pressing, leading to the decision to exclude the Atlantic from the lease sale program. The 2017-2022 program schedules no lease sales for the Pacific region, which has not had federal oil and gas lease sales since 1984. Congressional and presidential leasing moratoria have been in place for the past 30 years, with opposition from the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington to offshore oil and gas leasing. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation, although direct approval is not required for implementation. The 115th Congress could address the 2017-2022 program through legislation or choose not to do so. Members of Congress and other stakeholders can submit comments on draft versions of the program. BOEM received comments on the initial request for information, DPP, and PP, with varying opinions on lease sales and related issues such as seismic testing in the Atlantic. BOEM considers public comments when developing drafts of a five-year program, including feedback from Members of Congress. Oversight hearings may be held by the House or Senate to evaluate proposed oil and gas leasing programs. The House and Senate held hearings on the 2017-2022 program, discussing lease sales, Arctic and Atlantic leasing, and seismic surveying. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the PP version of the program, discussing targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale from the 2017-2022 program. Congress considered legislation, such as H.R. 1487 and S. 791, which aimed to use an earlier-proposed draft program for oil and gas leasing. The bills H.R. 1487 and S. 791 aimed to use an earlier-proposed draft program for oil and gas leasing for the years FY2015-FY2020. They directed that 3 lease sales would not be part of the program and required BOEM to conduct a previously proposed sale in the Atlantic region. The bills also mandated BOEM to conduct lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest and declared the program approved under NEPA. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales in various regions, including Alaska and Virginia. The bill H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA to require BOEM to make available at least 50% of unleased acreage in OCS planning areas with significant oil and gas resources. It also aimed to increase production by 3 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. Additionally, the bill would allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs under certain conditions. The bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by 3 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. It would amend the OCSLA to allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs. BOEM would be required to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021 that complied with these provisions, including lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. Other provisions included revenue sharing with states and the organization of DOI ocean energy agencies. H.R. 4749 directed lease sales off North Carolina with military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states. S. 1276 and S. 2011 had similar requirements for BOEM to lease areas with the largest undiscovered resources. The bills aimed to increase oil and gas production by leasing areas with the largest undiscovered resources, including in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. They also included provisions for lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and the Beaufort Sea planning area, with requirements for extending existing leases and revenue sharing with states. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings and reported on the bills in 2015. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on bills S. 1278, S. 1279, and S. 3203 in 2015 and 2016. These bills aimed to increase oil and gas production by leasing areas in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, South Atlantic planning area, and Cook Inlet planning area, with provisions for revenue sharing with the state of Alaska and changes to lease terms. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 3203 in 2016, which aimed to make changes to lease terms for the Alaska region under the OCSLA. Legislation introduced in the 112th and 114th Congresses sought to alter the lease sale schedule for the 2012-2017 and 2017-2022 programs, respectively. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to change the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential for further alterations in the 115th Congress."
