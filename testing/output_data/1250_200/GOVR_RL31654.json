    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments. Legal tools under the ESA include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensuring actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. It aims to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 species listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States. The ESA prohibits unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensures actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. Funding for the ESA expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA plays a crucial role in species conservation but can also be a point of contention in debates over resource allocation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) focuses on allocating scarce resources and protecting endangered species. Economic interests often clash in debates over resource management, such as the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest controversies. The polar bear symbolizes the global climate change debate. Tensions over the ESA have increased as more species are added to the protected list. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has found an avatar in the polar bear. Tensions over the ESA have increased as species are added to the protected list, with debates on balancing conservation with economic needs and demographic differences in support for species conservation. Critics argue for more accommodation of other needs, while defenders see the ESA as balancing development biases in other laws. Urban and suburban populations show stronger support for species conservation compared to rural areas, with Native Americans often supporting the survival of listed species. Native Americans, often dependent on natural resources, are involved in ESA issues and support listed species survival. Debates on ESA often focus on jobs, biology, and ethics, with religious groups participating. Industries like logging see ESA as a problem, while others like commercial fishing support it. The ESA contains statutory authority and provisions for appropriations. Congress has continued to fund ESA despite debates. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) contains provisions for appropriations, with the authorization expiring in FY1992. Despite this expiration, the act's prohibitions and authorities remain in effect, allowing agencies to carry out their responsibilities even without appropriated funds. The statutory obligations created by the ESA continue to be law, as confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Endangered Species Act's statutory obligations remain in effect even without appropriated funds, as confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Citizen suits can still be initiated for violations, potentially dissuading parties from prohibited acts. The distinction between authorizations and appropriations is recognized by both the House and Senate. The House Rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, with rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. These rules can be waived by either chamber during the legislative process. The House Rules Committee can also report special rules to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules and points of order. The House Rules allow for waivers of rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. Special rules can be adopted to waive points of order against provisions in appropriations measures. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, with prohibitions on unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. Points of order can be enforced, but waivers may be granted by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a funding lapse would impact various areas, such as interagency consultations for agency actions. No interagency consultations for agency actions, no issuance of incidental take statements, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions, reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations of species listed under CITES, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. The 104th Congress made efforts to end funding for the ESA, but it was abandoned due to potential negative effects. The ESA's goal is species recovery, but only 34 species have been delisted for recovery as of July 25, 2016. Ten species have become extinct. The ESA's goal is species recovery, but only 34 species have been delisted for recovery as of July 25, 2016. Some species have become extinct, and proving the extinction of rare species can be challenging. Some scientific studies show that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species. The ESA has helped prevent the extinction of species like red wolves and California condors. Without the ESA, some species may have declined further towards extinction. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species like red wolves and California condors. Scientific information and analysis are crucial for ESA actions. The leading causes of extinction, normalcy of extinction, and comparison of current extinction rates to background levels are key scientific issues. Habitat loss, including due to global climate change, is a significant factor putting species at risk. Extinction debate has shifted from over-exploitation to habitat loss as a major threat to species survival. Global climate change, nonnative invasive species, and habitat loss are major factors contributing to the demise of many species. The introduction of nonnative species as disease vectors, predators, or competitors has led to a gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna. Many species are threatened by multiple factors, and some decline for no obvious reason. The current rate of extinction is a concern for scientists, with evidence showing that the vast majority of species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. Many scientists are concerned about the current rate of extinction, which is believed to exceed background rates. Estimating current extinction rates is challenging due to uncertainty about the total number of species on Earth. Conservative assumptions are used to estimate extinction rates, with typical estimates around 17,000 species per year. Various methods suggest that current extinction rates are higher than background rates. The current rate of extinction is believed to exceed background rates, with estimates ranging from 100 to 10,000 times higher. Critics question these calculations due to uncertainties, but most biologists argue that similar results are generated using different methods. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be revived. The current rate of extinction is believed to exceed background rates, with estimates ranging from 100 to 10,000 times higher. Once extinct, a species cannot be revived. Some argue that a return to an equal number of species, even if different, would constitute a recovery. Recovery after major extinction events in the geologic record took up to 25 million years. If current extinction and recovery rates are comparable to past rates, the return to pre-historic species numbers would take several million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines a threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The ESA protects all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is afforded for organisms not considered animals or plants. \"Take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. The Endangered Species Act prohibits actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior and provides for the relationship of the two Secretaries and their respective powers in managing listed species. The Endangered Species Act prohibits actions that harm listed species. The Secretary must decide whether to list a species based on scientific information, without considering economic effects. Species can be designated as endangered or threatened based on their decline and threats to survival. A threatened species is defined as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout its range. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has evolved, with courts rejecting a previous restrictive interpretation by the Department of the Interior. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation emphasizing the importance of a portion's contribution to the species' viability. The range of a species is crucial for its viability, even if the species is not currently endangered. The determination of endangered or threatened status must be based on scientific factors, without considering economic impacts. Listing a species is compared to diagnosing a potentially fatal disease, emphasizing the importance of a portion's contribution to the species' survival. The decision to list a species is compared to diagnosing a fatal disease, emphasizing the importance of basing decisions solely on biological criteria. The addition of the word \"solely\" in legislation aims to prevent non-biological factors from influencing the listing or delisting process. Economic considerations are deemed irrelevant, with the focus solely on the species' biological status. The only alternatives for listing a species are as endangered, threatened, or not listed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) emphasizes that listing a species should be based solely on biological criteria, with no consideration for economic factors. The decision to list a species is a scientific one, and once determined, conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs while still achieving conservation goals. Petitions can be filed to change a species' status, subject to specific standards and deadlines outlined in the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires FWS and NMFS to make initial determinations within 90 days of receiving a petition, assessing if there is substantial scientific or commercial information for a warranted action. If warranted, a status review is conducted within 12 months to determine if listing is needed, with the possibility of being precluded by higher priority species. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, leading to settlements in 2011 with set deadlines for listing determinations on hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing and others requesting listing changes. The federal government receives numerous ESA petitions for listing species, leading to potential management decisions. Agencies must confer on actions that may harm proposed species or critical habitats. The conference process for proposed species is different from listed species consultations. The conference process for proposed species under the ESA is less formal and aims to advise agencies on minimizing adverse effects. Agencies may choose to follow a more complete process to avoid duplication of effort later. Once a species is listed, agencies have specific responsibilities to prevent harm and liability. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners can enter into conservation agreements to improve the status of a species and avoid listing. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must take action. The Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent risks to their well-being. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must publish the proposed regulation, notify relevant agencies, hold a public hearing, and take necessary actions. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may jeopardize candidate species. In case of emergencies, a candidate species may be promptly listed without following all normal listing procedures. The Secretary may skip some steps in the normal listing process for emergency listings to promptly list a species at risk. Special regulations can be promulgated to conserve threatened species, with tailored protections and recovery measures. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, with specific criteria for designation. The DPS designation under the ESA identifies genetically distinct and geographically separated segments of a species. Protection status is determined using the same criteria as for other listings, with special rules under Section 4(d) for threatened DPS. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, with 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, is used to identify genetically distinct and geographically separated segments of a species under the ESA. It was created due to the impracticality of using stock levels or full species levels. Congress added the concept of experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions, requiring separate geographical populations for distinction. Experimental populations under the ESA must be geographically separate from other animals of the same species. Their protected status is determined based on their risk of extinction. Special regulations apply, and no critical habitat is designated for nonessential populations. Delisting, uplisting, or downlisting follows the same process as listing. The process for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species under the Endangered Species Act is similar to the process for listing. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate a change in status or review a petition for a change. Decisions must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic impacts. Every five years, listed species are reviewed for potential status changes. Critical habitat includes areas essential for conservation, even outside the species' original geographic range. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, including areas outside the original geographic range if necessary. Critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species as of July 25, 2016. Federal agencies must avoid harming critical habitat through their actions or activities they fund. Private land is affected by critical habitat designation only if federal action is involved. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, considering economic impacts and other relevant factors. Economic factors must be considered in the designation of critical habitat, with some areas possibly excluded to prevent extinction of species. The Endangered Species Act requires the designation of critical habitat for listed species, considering economic impacts. Private land use restrictions primarily stem from the prohibition on taking listed species, with critical habitat designation playing a minor role. A provision in P.L. 108-136 exempts Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation if they provide a benefit to the lands. The provision in P.L. 108-136 exempts Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation if they provide a benefit to the lands, taking national security into consideration. This exemption was added due to concerns about interference with military activities. Conservation groups noted a contradiction in the Fish and Wildlife Service's prioritization of critical habitat designation, citing budget constraints. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faces budget constraints and has not complied with all demands of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Conservation groups criticize FWS for not requesting increased funds for listing and placing funding restrictions on critical habitat designation. FWS believes critical habitat designation offers limited protection and is a poor use of resources, despite lawsuits for failing to designate critical habitat. Designating critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faces budget constraints and criticism for not requesting increased funds for listing and placing funding restrictions on critical habitat designation. FWS believes critical habitat designation offers limited protection and is a poor use of resources, despite lawsuits for failing to designate critical habitat. Designating critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, but the FWS previously disagreed on the extent of this protection. The definition of \"conservation\" under the Endangered Species Act was changed in February 2016 to focus more on the recovery of listed species. This change came after federal courts of appeal found that the previous definition did not align with the ESA's goal of species recovery. The new definition emphasizes the importance of preserving critical habitat for the conservation of listed species. The Endangered Species Act requires the development of recovery plans for listed species, covering birds and mammals without favoring specific taxonomic groups. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species. Land can be acquired for conservation purposes using funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The ESA mandates cooperation with states to conserve protected species through cooperative agreements. The Endangered Species Act mandates cooperation with states to conserve protected species through cooperative agreements, which may receive federal funds with a 25% matching amount. The 1988 ESA amendments established a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance, with an annual appropriation requirement. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment to determine if formal consultation is necessary when actions may adversely affect a listed species. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to complete a biological assessment to determine if formal consultation is needed to avoid jeopardizing endangered species or critical habitat. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, ensures that federal actions do not harm protected species. If no jeopardy is found, a biological opinion is issued with conditions for the action to proceed. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to complete a biological assessment to determine if formal consultation is needed to avoid jeopardizing endangered species or critical habitat. The consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, ensures that federal actions do not harm protected species. The incidental take statement specifies terms and conditions for federal actions to proceed without jeopardizing species or habitat. The BiOp must suggest alternatives if harm is likely, based on the best available scientific and commercial data. Consultations usually result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or offer reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary is to complete consultation within 90 days for wholly federal actions. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within 90 days for a wholly federal action, with the option to extend up to 150 days. Formal consultation may take a year or more. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain an exemption. Exemptions are available only for actions, not species, and require approval from the Endangered Species Committee. Exemptions for actions, not species, require approval from the high-level Endangered Species Committee (ESC) consisting of specified federal officials and state representatives. The ESC must grant an exemption if deemed necessary for national security or in presidentially declared disaster areas. The President has the authority to exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. To qualify for an exemption, federal agencies must have conducted required consultations and made efforts to consider alternatives that would not harm endangered species or their habitats. Additionally, agencies must avoid irreversible commitments of resources. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires the Exemption Sub-Committee (ESC) to grant exemptions for projects if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the risks, the action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments have been made that jeopardize species or habitat. Special provisions apply in specific instances outlined in the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires the Exemption Sub-Committee (ESC) to grant exemptions for projects under specific conditions. The exemption process is complex and can take 280 days. Funding for mitigation measures is the responsibility of the applicant, lasting potentially forever. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere due to exemptions applying to actions, not species. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere due to exemptions applying to actions, not species. A governor balancing state interests may find this challenging. Exemption from the ESA may not be enough if other statutory obligations are in place. Parties may hesitate to support actions that increase extinction risk. Consultation allows agencies to modify actions to avoid harm to species. Agencies consider ESA consequences early to prevent conflicts. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prompts agencies to consider consequences early to prevent conflicts and avoid the need for exemptions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of listed species with habitat conservation plans. The 1990s saw expanded use of permits with streamlined procedures for minimal impact activities. Other provisions regulate exemptions for raptors, subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and control trade in endangered species parts. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts, controls trade in parts or products of endangered species, and specifies rules for establishing experimental populations. The ESA enumerates prohibited acts, including taking endangered species and violating regulations. Threatened species are subject to similar protections as endangered species. The ESA's prohibitions apply broadly to any person under U.S. jurisdiction, with exceptions for permits like incidental take permits. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts, controls trade in parts or products of endangered species, and specifies rules for establishing experimental populations. Sections 9 and 10 of the ESA provide exceptions, including incidental take permits. Section 11 of the ESA exempts individuals from civil penalties if they can show a good-faith belief in protecting themselves or others from bodily harm from endangered species. Violators of the ESA may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators and those involved in importing or exporting wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply. The ESA allows for enforcement through lawsuits in federal district court to enjoin violators or compel the Secretary to perform duties related to listing provisions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for enforcement through lawsuits in federal district court to compel the Secretary to perform duties related to listing provisions. The citizen suit provisions of the ESA have been used to force agencies to conserve species, with litigation costs and attorneys' fees awarded when appropriate. Citizen suits seeking to list species or challenge listing delays are common, driving efforts to protect endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) implements international treaties like CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. CITES categorizes species based on extinction risk for trade regulation, while the ESA focuses on habitat protection. Violations of CITES are U.S. law violations within the country. The Western Hemisphere Convention aims to establish nature reserves, control wildlife trade, and protect wildlife. These international provisions are integrated into the ESA's goals for wildlife conservation. The ESA implements international treaties like CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for wildlife conservation. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES, with authority to enforce trade regulations and ensure specimens are exported legally. The Secretary is also named as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, responsible for overseeing legal exports and imports of specimens. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits importing or exporting listed species in the US, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers/exporters of fish/wildlife need permission, record-keeping, inspections, and designated ports. The ESA also involves an Endangered Species Committee (ESC) making decisions on exemptions, such as in the case of Grayrocks Dam affecting whooping cranes. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) involves the Endangered Species Committee (ESC) making decisions on exemptions for projects like Grayrocks Dam and Tellico Dam. The ESC granted an exemption for Grayrocks Dam conditioned on mitigation measures for whooping crane habitat, while the Tellico Dam faced opposition and litigation due to the endangered snail darter. Litigation was filed to stop the construction of the dam, resulting in the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill. The decision clarified the broad reach of the ESA and its relationship to public works projects. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process and provided an exemption for the dam if no decision was reached within a specified time. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for Tellico, Congress directed the dam's completion in P.L. 96-69. The snail darter was reclassified as threatened, and controversy surrounded Bureau of Land Management timber sales for the northern spotted owl habitat. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 timber sales, which were later withdrawn in the Clinton Administration. Other exemption applications included a refinery in Eastport, ME, a docking area for barges in Mound City, IL, and a dredging project in Suwanee Sound, Florida. The consulting engineer of the Suwanee River Authority applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for the endangered manatee. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Authority later withdrew the application as the engineer lacked the authority to apply on their behalf."
