    "content": "SECTION 1. RELEASE OR DETENTION OF A MATERIAL WITNESS. Amendments to Title 18 include Section 3144, which pertains to the release or detention of a material witness in criminal cases before a court of the United States or a Federal grand jury. A judicial officer may order the arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe their testimony is material and they have failed to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. The requirement of a summons or subpoena may be waived if there is clear and convincing evidence that the person is likely to flee. A judicial officer may issue a warrant for a material witness if there is clear and convincing evidence that serving a summons or subpoena is likely to result in the person fleeing or cannot secure their appearance. The warrant must contain the witness's name or a description, specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding, command their arrest, inform them of their right to counsel, and be signed by a judicial officer. The warrant issued for a material witness must be executed by arresting the witness and shown to them upon arrest. If the arresting officer does not have the warrant, they must inform the witness of its existence and purpose, and provide it upon request. After executing a warrant for a material witness, the officer must return it to the judicial officer. If the warrant is unexecuted, it can be canceled by a judicial officer upon request. The material witness must be brought before a judicial officer without delay upon arrest. Upon arrest of a material witness pursuant to a warrant, the initial appearance must take place in the district of arrest or an adjacent district if it can occur more promptly there. At this appearance, a judicial officer must inform the witness of the warrant, their rights to counsel, and provide a reasonable opportunity for counsel to be obtained. Upon the initial appearance of a material witness arrested under a warrant, the judicial officer must allow the witness to consult with counsel, decide on release or detention, and transfer the witness to the district where the warrant was issued if necessary. The judicial officer will order the release or detention of the witness, with the option of release on personal recognizance or unsecured bond. Upon initial appearance, a material witness can be released on personal recognizance, unsecured bond, or conditions unless clear evidence shows they won't appear. Testimony can be secured by deposition if the witness can't comply. If no assurance of appearance is found, detention may be ordered after a hearing. If no assurance of appearance is found, a judicial officer may order the witness to be detained for up to 5 days or until their testimony can be secured by deposition or court appearance. Detention can be extended for additional 5-day periods upon motion of a party. The witness can be detained for up to 30 days in a criminal case or 10 days in a grand jury proceeding if their testimony cannot be secured by deposition or court appearance. Good cause must be shown for the detention, and factors are considered by a judicial officer for release. A judicial officer considers factors such as the witness's history and characteristics when deciding on the release or detention of a material witness. Release orders must meet specific requirements, while detention orders must comply with certain conditions, including holding the witness separately from individuals charged with criminal offenses under the least restrictive conditions. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on the use of warrants under this section. The report should include the number of warrants sought and granted or denied, the outcomes of material witness arrests, and the average number of days witnesses are held. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to the Judiciary Committees on the use of warrants under this section, including the number of warrants sought and outcomes of material witness arrests. Rule 46(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is amended to supervise detention of defendants awaiting trial and material witnesses to eliminate unnecessary detention."
