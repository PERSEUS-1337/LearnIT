    "content": "The Washoe Tribe Land Conveyance is addressed in Section 1. Congress finds that the Washoe Tribe's ancestral homeland in the Lake Tahoe region was recognized in 1997, with objectives to support their traditional land use and access to Lake Tahoe for cultural practices. The Washoe Tribe aims to reestablish traditional cultural practices at Lake Tahoe. The Act's purposes include returning the Tribe to Lake Tahoe and allowing members to engage in cultural practices for spiritual renewal, land stewardship, and traditional learning. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey land to the Secretary of the Interior for the Tribe's use. The Washoe Tribe aims to reestablish traditional cultural practices at Lake Tahoe by acquiring a 24.3-acre parcel of land north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada. The conveyance of the land includes a nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System land. Additionally, the Secretary of Agriculture will provide a reciprocal easement to the Tribe for vehicular access to the parcel for administrative and safety purposes, as well as for members with difficulty accessing the land on foot due to age, infirmity, or disability. The Washoe Tribe aims to reestablish traditional cultural practices at Lake Tahoe by acquiring a 24.3-acre parcel of land north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada. The conveyance of the land includes restrictions on development and environmental compliance. The Tribe must limit the use of the parcel to traditional and customary uses, prohibit permanent residential or commercial development, and comply with environmental regulations. If the Secretary of the Interior determines misuse, the land may revert back. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that the Washoe Tribe has violated land use restrictions on the 24.3-acre parcel, and the Tribe fails to take corrective action, ownership of the land will transfer to the Secretary of the Interior in trust for the Tribe, or revert to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Senate passed the document on August 1, 2002, with Jeri Thomson as the Secretary."
