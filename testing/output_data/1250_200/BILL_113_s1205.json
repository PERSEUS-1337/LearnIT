    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy is wasted in the United States, with a portion of it being released as waste heat from power plants and other facilities. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Additionally, renewable energy resources can be utilized to meet local energy needs, which can enhance the reliability and resiliency of energy supplies in the country. Local energy infrastructure can enhance energy supply resiliency and security by utilizing waste heat and renewable energy resources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, decreasing emissions, and keeping energy dollars in local economies. District energy systems play a crucial role in tapping into waste heat and renewable energy resources, as well as expanding the implementation of combined heat and power systems. District energy systems deliver thermal energy from a CHP system to various end users such as colleges, hospitals, and downtown areas. They help reduce peak power demand, transmission constraints, and meet air conditioning needs through thermal storage, CHP systems, and chilled water delivery. Evaluating and implementing district energy systems involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional challenges, often requiring technical assistance to overcome barriers. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. It also seeks to provide technical assistance for evaluating and developing local energy projects. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure projects by providing technical assistance and facilitating low-cost financing through loan guarantees. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure projects by providing technical assistance and facilitating low-cost financing through loan guarantees. Section 3 defines key terms. The Act promotes local energy infrastructure projects through a Loan Guarantee Program. Key terms like Combined Heat and Power System, District Energy System, and Local Energy Infrastructure are defined. The curr_chunk defines terms related to local energy infrastructure, microgrids, and renewable energy resources. The curr_chunk defines renewable energy resources, including biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. It also defines renewable thermal energy as heating or cooling derived from renewable sources. The curr_chunk defines thermal energy as heating or cooling energy used for space heating, hot water, air conditioning, or process cooling. It also defines waste energy as energy contained in exhaust gases, hot liquids, or industrial tail gas. The curr_chunk specifies waste energy sources that include gas from industrial processes, waste gas, pressure drops in gas systems, condenser water, and other forms of waste energy. It also states that unused waste energy in existing facilities or unconventional energy sources in new facilities are eligible for consideration. The technical assistance program is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance to help eligible entities with local energy infrastructure, including identifying opportunities, assessing characteristics, utility interconnection, negotiation of contracts, permitting, marketing, business planning, and engineering design. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance to eligible entities for local energy infrastructure, including assessment, design, and dissemination of information. Nonprofit or for-profit entities are eligible for assistance, and grants may cover costs for initial assessment, feasibility studies, and guidance on overcoming barriers to implementation. The program provides technical assistance for local energy infrastructure, covering costs for assessment, design, and guidance on overcoming implementation barriers. Eligible entities must submit applications for assistance on a competitive basis, with priority given to projects that maximize elimination of fossil fuel use. The Secretary prioritizes projects based on maximizing fossil fuel elimination, enhancing energy reliability, minimizing environmental impact, promoting renewable energy, boosting industrial competitiveness, and creating local jobs. Rules and procedures for program administration must be adopted within 180 days, with an authorization of $150 million for implementation. Authorization of $150 million is allocated for the implementation of projects prioritizing fossil fuel elimination, energy reliability, environmental impact reduction, renewable energy promotion, industrial competitiveness, and job creation. SEC. 5 introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program, introduced under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, allows the Secretary to provide loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure'. The Secretary must reserve $4 billion of loan guarantee authority under section 1703 for this program and utilize unobligated funds from section 1703 for loan guarantees under this program. SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF INVESTMENT AREA. Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to include local energy infrastructure as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
