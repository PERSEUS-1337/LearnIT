    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and funded by general revenues, providing services to families receiving TANF benefits. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides services to families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage. Families not automatically eligible must apply for CSE services with a maximum application fee of $25. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations and payments for 50% of its caseload. The CSE program handles at least 50% of all child support cases and provides various services including parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment, support order review and modification, support payment collection and distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, liens, and reporting to credit bureaus. Civil and criminal contempt procedures are also in place. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States were required to implement procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and withholding licenses. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. It required states to conduct data matches with financial institutions to seize debtor noncustodial parents' resources and authorized the denial, revocation, or restriction of passports for debtor parents. States were also mandated to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and expand full faith and credit procedures. The federal government reimburses states for administering their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs and incentivizes effective programs. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a cost-neutral system of incentive payments to states. The CSE program, established by the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. It also promotes self-sufficiency and parental responsibility. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor families. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the CSE program and increase collections. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program to increase collections and provide stable income for single-parent families. The bills focus on simplifying CSE rules, strengthening family-first policies, and revising enforcement tools. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state. The assignment rules for child support rights under TANF benefits determine who receives the payments. Collections are kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement. The date of assignment determines which arrearages are permanently assigned to the state. The assignment rules for child support under TANF benefits determine payment recipients. Arrearages are permanently assigned to the state, with pre-assistance arrearages temporarily assigned. Proposed changes may limit assignment to child support accrued during TANF receipt. Distribution rules dictate payment order based on assignment rules. Distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, deciding which claim is paid first. While TANF families receive benefits, the state can keep current support and assigned arrearages up to the amount of benefits paid. States have the discretion to decide how much of the child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family and whether to treat them as income. States are required to pay the federal government its share of child support collections. Child support collections are required to be paid by states to the federal government for TANF families. Some states continue to pass through and disregard a portion of the child support collected. Two bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families rather than reimbursing welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing and whether to support current policies or encourage new ones. The federal government would share in the costs of pass-through and disregard policies used by states under S. 667. States can pay up to $400 per month in child support to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. H.R. 240 incentivizes states to increase child support payments to TANF families without requiring federal reimbursement. The House bill proposes subsidized child support pass-through payments to TANF families, with the federal government sharing costs. The federal government would cover the greater of $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous share. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursement, following the \"family-first\" policy. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes distributing child support to families once they leave TANF, aiming to reduce dependence on public assistance. Child support accrued before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 allows states to give former TANF families full child support collected on their behalf. S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose changes to child support distribution, allowing former TANF families to receive full child support collected on their behalf, including arrearages. The federal government would share costs with states for paying arrearages to families first. Both bills also address passport denial for noncustodial parents with past-due child support. The proposed changes in S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance child support collection by allowing for easier passport denial, facilitating collection from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and enabling states to use federal tax refund offsets. Additionally, the bills authorize the comparison of noncustodial parent information with insurer data to pursue child support arrearages and allow for interstate child support cases. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill aims to improve child support collection by empowering states to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, ensuring medical support for children, and notifying health care plan administrators. It also includes provisions for reviewing and adjusting child support orders, reporting procedures for locating custodial parents, setting funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service, and granting access to Indian tribes. H.R. 240 includes a provision for a $25 establishment. The CSE provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve child support collection by increasing funding, requiring adoption of UIFSA, and allowing Texas to operate its CSE program without a federal waiver. Indian tribes are designated as authorized persons for access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. A $25 annual fee is proposed for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF. Table 1 compares child support provisions in bills S. 667 and H.R. 240."
