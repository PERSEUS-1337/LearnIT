    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), outlines requirements for state assessments in order to receive Title I-A funding. This funding provides educational services to disadvantaged students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. States must comply with standards, assessments, and accountability systems to receive funds. The program was funded at $15.5 billion in FY2017. States must implement high-quality assessments in reading, math, and science, testing students annually in reading and math in grades 3-8 and once in high school, as well as testing students in science at least once in three grade spans. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires states to conduct annual assessments in reading, math, and science for students in grades 3-8 and once in high school. States have flexibility in how they administer assessments, including using nationally recognized tests for high school assessments and computer adaptive assessments for individualized responses. Additionally, alternate assessments are allowed for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The ESSA allows for computer adaptive assessments, exceptions for 8th grade students taking advanced math, a demonstration authority for innovative assessment systems, and grants for assessment audits. The report discusses the new flexibility states have in meeting assessment requirements under the ESEA as amended by ESSA. It examines issues related to student growth, students with disabilities and English learners, computer adaptive assessments, participation requirements, and testing burden. States face the challenge of maintaining validity and reliability while implementing these changes. The ESEA requires states to administer 17 assessments annually in reading, math, and science, typically using summative assessments. Results are used for state accountability systems. Title I-A of the ESEA outlines academic assessment requirements, with some changes under ESSA. The report discusses state assessment requirements, changes made by ESSA, and the State Assessment Grants program. The section discusses changes made by the ESSA regarding state assessment requirements, including the allocation of funds to states. It also covers the Secretary's new authority to reserve funds for competitive grants for assessment audits and innovative assessments. The report examines current ESEA assessment requirements for reading, math, and science, specifying whether they existed before the ESSA implementation. States must administer high-quality assessments in these subjects annually in specific grade levels, with science assessments required within three grade spans. Academic assessments must be administered annually in specific grade levels and subjects, aligned with state standards. Results are used for school accountability and must measure the achievement of at least 95% of all students. States must explain how this requirement is incorporated into their accountability system. The ESSA added provisions related to a parent's right to opt a child out of required assessments, including state assessments meeting specific requirements for format, administration, and technical quality. LEAs receiving Title I-A funds must notify parents of their right to opt their child out of assessments. The ESSA provides flexibility for states in administering state assessments, allowing for either a single summative assessment or multiple interim assessments leading to a single score. States can also set limits on the time spent on assessments as a percentage of instructional hours. The ESSA requires states to provide evidence of assessment quality on their website, ensuring assessments are valid, reliable, and aligned with standards. States must use multiple measures for academic achievement and have flexibility in choosing assessment options. The ESSA authorizes new assessment options for high school assessments, including nationally recognized high school academic assessments aligned with state standards and computer adaptive assessments. These assessments must meet state approval criteria and provide valid, reliable data for all student subgroups. Computer adaptive assessments for elementary and secondary students adjust to individual responses, not requiring all students to see the same questions. The assessments must measure academic proficiency in state standards for the student's grade level and growth towards those standards. An exception allows 8th grade students taking advanced mathematics to take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th grade math assessment, under certain conditions. The ESSA added specific requirements for LEAs receiving Title I-A funds to provide public information on state assessments, including subject matter, purpose, time spent, schedule, and reporting format. These assessments are used in a state accountability system to identify schools for support and improvement based on performance. States previously determined AYP, but now use assessments to make these decisions. Prior to the ESSA, states assessed schools and LEAs based on student performance in math and reading, graduation rates, and assessment participation. Failure to meet these requirements triggered accountability consequences. As the deadline for 100% proficiency approached, more schools and LEAs struggled to make AYP. Under the accountability system prior to ESSA, schools could fail to make AYP based on student assessment results, triggering improvement requirements. ESSA made changes to lessen the high-stakes association between assessment results and school improvement identification, depending on state decisions. Student proficiency in math and reading is still considered in the accountability system, along with other indicators for differentiating public schools annually. The SEA must establish a system for differentiating public schools annually based on various indicators. This system helps identify low-achieving schools that need additional support to improve student achievement. Schools requiring comprehensive support and improvement include the lowest-performing 5% receiving Title I-A funds, public high schools with low graduation rates, schools not improving despite targeted support, and other categories determined by the state. States also inform LEAs about subgroups of consistently underperforming students for targeted support and improvement. The ESSA changes how schools are identified for support and improvement, reducing the emphasis on assessment results. States now have more flexibility in determining which schools need comprehensive or targeted support based on various indicators, rather than solely relying on assessment performance. This shift allows for a more nuanced approach in identifying schools in need of improvement. The ESEA authorizes funding for State Assessment Grants, with formula and competitive grants available based on trigger amounts in the legislation. Funds are allocated for state assessments and related activities, with a percentage reserved for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas. The Secretary can also reserve funds for assessment grants. The ESEA authorizes funding for State Assessment Grants, with formula and competitive grants available based on trigger amounts in the legislation. The Secretary reserves funds for assessment grants, including 20% for assessment system audits. Each state receives a minimum grant of $3 million, with remaining funds allocated based on student population. Excess funds are awarded through a competitive grant process for assessment activities. The Secretary can also reserve funds for state assessment formula grants to conduct assessment system audits, providing grants to states and LEAs for this purpose. The ESEA authorizes funding for State Assessment Grants, with formula and competitive grants available based on trigger amounts in the legislation. States receive grants to conduct assessment system audits and provide subgrants to LEAs for assessment audits. States must develop a plan to improve and streamline the assessment system by eliminating unnecessary assessments and supporting best practices. The ESEA also includes a demonstration authority for innovative assessment systems, allowing states to apply for developing new assessment methods. The demonstration authority allows for the development of innovative assessment systems that may include various types of assessments for each student. Up to seven SEAs, with a limit on states in consortia, can receive this authority. Funding is not provided separately, but states can use existing grant funding. States can apply for an initial three-year period to develop and implement innovative assessment systems in a subset of LEAs, with the option to extend for two years to transition to statewide use. States and consortia can apply for a two-year extension to transition innovative assessment systems statewide if successful. Applications must show that the assessments meet state requirements and can be competency-based, embedded in instruction, interim, cumulative, or performance-based. States have the authority to choose their assessments and align them with academic standards. States have the authority to select their own assessments and academic content aligned with standards. Assessments in grades 3-8 can be state-specific, common, or a combination. High school assessments include state-specific, common, end-of-course exams, and a new option for \"nationally recognized\" assessments. NCLB expanded state assessment requirements under ESEA. In 2002, the NCLB expanded state assessments under ESEA, leading to each state having its own academic standards and assessments. This lack of standardization prompted the development of the Common Core State Standards Initiative in 2009, aiming to create common standards for reading and math to facilitate comparisons among states. Adoption of these standards is optional. The Obama Administration supported the adoption of performance standards and aligned assessments by states through initiatives like Race to the Top State Grants and ESEA flexibility package. The Department of Education funded consortia like PARCC and SBAC to develop new assessment systems aligned with college- and career-ready standards. Both PARCC and SBAC proposed to use the Common Core State Standards for their assessments. The Obama Administration incentivized states to adopt college- and career-ready standards through initiatives like Race to the Top State Grants and ESEA flexibility package. Initial interest in common assessments was high, but participation declined in later years. The federal government incentivized states to adopt common standards and measure student growth in assessments. Participation in common assessments initially high but declined over time. Two organizations track state assessment administration. The federal government incentivized states to adopt common standards and measure student growth in assessments. Participation in common assessments initially high but declined over time. ECS and Education Week collect information on state assessment administration. About half of all states used state-specific or end-of-course assessments in 2015-2016. Some states used a combination of common assessments, state-specific assessments, end-of-course exams, and nationally recognized high school academic assessments. Michigan, Louisiana, and Massachusetts implemented blended approaches in assessment administration. In 2015-2016, states used various assessment approaches, including common assessments like SBAC and PARCC. States submitted ESEA state plans for approval to receive funding under Title I-A. The status of state assessment systems is evolving, with states detailing their assessment plans in the approved ESEA state plans. States are using a variety of assessments to meet Title I-A requirements, including SBAC, end-of-course assessments, and PSAT/SAT. Changes in ESEA provide more flexibility for states in using assessments for accountability. It is crucial to maintain the validity and reliability of state assessments for effective accountability systems. The section discusses assessment-related issues under ESSA-enacted changes, focusing on student growth, special needs assessments, computer adaptive assessments, opt-out practices, and testing burden. It highlights adjustments intended to enhance assessment use in accountability systems and identifies challenges in using assessments for accountability purposes. These issues may need monitoring as ESSA adjustments are implemented. Prior to ESSA, state accountability systems only reported student proficiency, which has been criticized for not measuring school quality or teacher effectiveness accurately. This focus on proficiency led to instructional resources being targeted towards students near proficiency, neglecting those below or above the bar. ESSA requires reporting data on student growth and other measures to address these issues. Under ESSA, states, LEAs, and schools must report data on student proficiency. Some education policy groups advocate for using a performance index or average scale scores to measure achievement more accurately and incentivize schools to improve all students' achievement levels. Under ESSA, states, LEAs, and schools must report data on student proficiency. Some education policy groups advocate for using average scale scores to measure achievement more accurately and incentivize schools to improve all students' achievement levels. Scale scores are sensitive to changes in achievement and can be compared across students, subgroups, and schools. The ESSA allows for student growth to be measured in addition to proficiency, giving states the option to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems. The selection of an assessment can limit the choices states have in developing growth models. Three types of growth models identified in state accountability systems are state-set targets, student growth percentiles, and SAS EVAAS, which measures value-added growth. The SAS EVAAS model measures value-added growth, which refers to the additional positive effect on student achievement above expected growth. It follows students over time and provides projection reports on future achievement. The CCSSO outlined considerations for growth models in ESEA accountability systems, identifying five common models like gain scores and growth rates. The SAS EVAAS model measures value-added growth by using growth rates, student growth percentiles, transition tables, and residual models to assess student achievement and project future growth. These models help aggregate data across grade levels and compare student growth to peers. Residual models, also known as \"value-added\" models, describe the impact of external factors on student growth over time. They compare class, school, or LEA performance to expected average change without a vertical scale. Some caution against using a \"growth to proficiency\" model, as it may not differentiate between students reaching proficient or advanced levels, potentially neglecting those far below or above proficiency. By using a \"growth to proficiency\" model, schools can focus on students near the proficiency score and weight different types of growth accordingly. This approach allows for a more valid measure of school accountability by considering student growth over time and not penalizing schools for low achieving students who meet growth targets. Reliable assessments sensitive to student growth are essential for measuring progress accurately. The ESEA requires reliable assessments for measuring growth targets in schools, including special provisions for students with disabilities and ELs. States must include all students with disabilities in statewide assessments and disaggregate results. Alternate assessments for some students with disabilities are limited in state accountability systems, while ELs' inclusion varies based on their time in the US and English proficiency level. The ESEA requires states to ensure that students with disabilities fully participate in state assessment systems by using universal design for learning principles. This inclusive framework aims to reduce cognitive burden by providing multiple means of representation, action, and engagement. Accommodations must be allowed for students with disabilities during assessments. The ESEA requires states to provide accommodations for students with disabilities during assessments to ensure validity. Accommodations, such as \"read aloud\" for students with reading disabilities, aim to accurately measure students' abilities without interference. The ESSA allows for alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. States must develop guidelines to identify students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" for participation in alternate assessments. The Individualized Education Program team determines eligibility on a case-by-case basis, informing parents of the decision's implications on receiving a regular high school diploma. Eligible students often have intellectual disabilities, autism, or multiple disabilities. States can offer alternate assessments aligned with alternate achievement standards, with a limit of 1% of students assessed in each content area. The state can provide an alternate assessment aligned with alternate achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities, with a 1% cap on the total number of students assessed in each content area. Any LEA exceeding this cap must justify the need to the SEA, with the state providing oversight. Scores over the cap are considered nonproficient. Alternate assessments are deemed more valid for these students as they align better with their academic content standards compared to general assessments. When students with significant cognitive disabilities participate in general assessments, they may be assessed on grade-level standards that do not reflect their learning content. Alternate assessments, such as portfolio assessments or rating scales, may be more valid but reliability issues, like inter-scorer agreement, must be considered to maintain accountability system validity. Inclusion of all English Learners in statewide assessments is required, with results disaggregated for these students. States must ensure that all English Learners (ELs) are included in statewide assessments, with results disaggregated for these students. ELs participate in assessments of English language proficiency (ELP) and statewide assessments of reading, mathematics, and science. Most states use the WIDA consortium for ELP assessments, specifically the ACCESS 2.0 test. The assessment must align with state English proficiency standards in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. In 2017, the WIDA consortium updated English language proficiency standards to align with college- and career-readiness. This led to some states seeing lower proficiency levels and fewer students exiting EL support programs. ELs must be included in statewide assessments for reading, math, and science, with accommodations provided. States can assess ELs in the language that yields accurate results, but must assess in English after three years in U.S. schools. The ESSA allows for assessing EL students in a different language for up to two additional years if they have not reached English proficiency for reading assessments. States can exclude EL students from reading assessments for up to 12 months. Recently arrived EL students can be assessed in reading and math but their results may be excluded from the state's accountability system. The ESSA allows for assessing EL students in a different language for up to two additional years if they have not reached English proficiency for reading assessments. States can exclude EL students from reading assessments for up to 12 months. Recently arrived EL students can be assessed in reading and math but their results may be excluded from the state's accountability system. Additionally, the ESSA now allows states to include the scores of formerly identified ELs in the EL subgroup for a period of four years after the student ceases to be identified as an EL, potentially leading to longer accountability within the EL subgroup. The ESSA has changed the population of students in the EL subgroup, potentially improving subgroup performance over time. The use of computer adaptive assessments is now explicitly authorized under Title I-A, allowing for individualized assessments for students. Computer adaptive assessments adjust to a student's ability by administering different items based on their responses. The ESSA clarified that all students taking the assessment do not need to receive the same items. Assessments become more difficult as students answer correctly, reaching a \"ceiling\" when they either complete the most difficult items or answer incorrectly. This adaptive approach allows assessments to measure a student's ability above or below grade level, in line with state academic standards required by the ESEA. The ESEA requires computer adaptive assessments to measure a student's academic proficiency based on state standards for their grade level, with the ability to also measure proficiency above and below grade level. These assessments are used for alternate assessments for students with disabilities and English language proficiency assessments for ELs. Concerns include longer administration times for high-achieving students and accurate measurement of special populations. Computer adaptive assessments raise concerns about accurately measuring special populations, such as students with disabilities and ELs, who may have inconsistent knowledge levels. There are worries that these assessments may test computer literacy skills instead of academic content areas like reading and mathematics, potentially leading to invalid results. Other issues include technical, financial, and reporting challenges for schools implementing computer adaptive assessments. Computer adaptive assessments present challenges for schools, including the need for computers, software, technical support, and teacher training. Statewide assessment systems require testing all students to ensure valid and reliable results for accountability. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) includes provisions regarding parental rights in the assessment process, allowing parents to opt their children out of academic assessments. State or local laws regarding opt-outs cannot be preempted by ESSA requirements. Excessive opt-outs may impact assessment validity. Excessive numbers of opt-outs in academic assessments may undermine the validity of student achievement measurement and the state accountability system by not representing the whole student population. States are required to assess all students, but in education research, a representative sample is more common. This sample reflects the entire population in terms of demographic characteristics. In statewide assessment systems under the ESEA, states must assess all students to accurately reflect the true achievement of the population. Opting out of assessments may lead to an unrepresentative sample, undermining the validity of student achievement measurement and state accountability systems. The emphasis on educational assessment within federal education policies has led to debate about the time spent on tests and test preparation in schools. Critics argue that test-based accountability narrows the curriculum by taking away instructional time, leading to pressure on teachers to focus on test preparation activities. Test preparation in schools can involve emphasizing specific content on assessments, changing assignments to match test formats, and providing test-taking strategies. Teachers often reallocate instructional time towards tested subjects like reading and math, leading to a narrowed curriculum. While some test preparation can improve test scores for students unfamiliar with standardized testing, excessive alignment between test items and curricula, coaching on specific test items, or cheating can negatively impact test validity. Score inflation is a concern in high-stakes assessments due to overuse of test preparation strategies, such as excessive coaching and cheating. Studies have shown discrepancies in student achievement levels and gains between state assessments and low-stakes tests like NAEP, indicating potential score inflation. This undermines the validity of assessment results. The ESSA added provisions to address concerns about inflated state assessment scores, questioning the validity of conclusions based on these assessments. States can set limits on assessment time, provide detailed information on assessments, and receive grants for audit assessments to determine the necessity of tests. The State Assessment Grant program provides funds for states to conduct audit assessments to determine the necessity of tests, and for LEAs to do the same at the local level."
