    "content": "The \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" may be cited as the Short Title. It establishes the Child Care Business Loan Program. The \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" establishes the Child Care Business Loan Program under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, amending section 502 to authorize loans with restrictions and limitations. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003 amends section 502 to allow loans for small, non-profit child care businesses, subject to approval by the Administration and meeting eligibility requirements. The Administrator is required to report on the program every 6 months. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration must report every 6 months on the implementation of the program for small, non-profit child care businesses, including the date of implementation, issuance of rules, and the number and amount of loans disbursed. The report is to be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report on child care small business loans to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business by March 31, 2006. The report will evaluate the implementation of the loan program and its effectiveness during the first 2 years. The report will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the child care small business loan program, including participation by Certified Development Companies, lenders, and small businesses, marketing efforts, and the number of businesses that applied, were approved, and received loan disbursements. The Small Business Administration will issue final rules for the loan program within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The amendments will be in effect until September 30, 2006, applying to all loans made during this period."
