    "content": "The \"Mining Claim Maintenance Act of 2001\" is referenced in this Act, which pertains to the general mining laws in title 30 of the United States Code. Title I of the Act addresses mining claim fees, specifically the maintenance fee. The \"Mining Claim Maintenance Act of 2001\" requires holders of unpatented mining claims to pay a $100 claim maintenance fee annually to the Secretary of the Interior. This fee replaces the assessment work requirement in the general mining laws. Oil shale claims are exempt from this fee if they are subject to fees under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Act exempts oil shale claims from the $100 claim maintenance fee if subject to fees under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Secretary may waive the fee for patent applicants meeting certain criteria. Claimants holding 10 or fewer mining claims can elect to perform assessment work in lieu of the fee. Claimants with 10 or fewer mining claims can choose to do assessment work instead of paying the maintenance fee if they meet specific criteria related to mineral production, exploration work, and surface disturbance. Claimants with 10 or fewer mining claims can opt to do assessment work instead of paying the maintenance fee, meeting filing requirements and certifying work performance to the Secretary of the Interior annually. Definitions include \"related party\" as spouse, dependent children, and individuals under common control with the claimant. The term \"control\" in relation to claimants includes actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control through various means such as common directors, officers, stockholders, and holding companies. SEC. 102. LOCATION FEE.\n\nFor each new mining claim, a $25.00 location fee is required in addition to the annual claim maintenance fee.\n\nSEC. 103. CO-OWNERSHIP.\n\nCo-ownership rules remain in effect, with the claim maintenance fee replacing assessment requirements.\n\nSEC. 104. FAILURE TO PAY.\n\nFailure to pay fees results in forfeiture of the claim.\n\nSEC. 105. OTHER REQUIREMENTS. (a) Federal Land Policy and Management Act Requirements remain unchanged, specifically related to filings required by section 314(b) and fees for claims, mill, or tunnel sites. \n(b) Section 2324 of the Revised Statutes is amended to include waivers granted under the Mining Claim Maintenance Act of 2001 for claims located after May 10, 1872. \n(c) The Secretary of the Interior will adjust fees every 5 years based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
