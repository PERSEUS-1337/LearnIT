    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Act of 2001\" may be cited as the Act. It provides loan guarantees for renewable energy sources. The \"Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Act of 2001\" establishes the Renewable Energy Source Facility Guaranteed Loan Program, defining key terms like Board, Incremental hydropower, Program, and Qualified renewable energy source facility. The Renewable Energy Source Facility Guaranteed Loan Program establishes a Loan Guarantee Board composed of key officials to administer loan guarantees for qualified renewable energy facilities. The Program can guarantee loans from private institutions following established procedures. The Loan Guarantee Board administers loan guarantees for renewable energy facilities, ensuring small businesses receive appropriate guarantees. The total guarantee limit is $750,000,000, and applications are processed promptly. Loan guarantees may be issued if credit is not available under reasonable terms. The Loan Guarantee Board provides loan guarantees for renewable energy facilities, with a total limit of $750,000,000. Guarantees are issued if credit is not available under reasonable terms, with loans repayable by December 31, 2025, and interest rates determined by the Board. The Loan Guarantee Board requires loan agreements for renewable energy facilities to have terms that cannot be changed without Board consent. Loan guarantees must include protective provisions determined by the Board and require security at the time of commitment. A fee, not exceeding 0.5% of the loan balance, is paid to the Treasury for program costs. Audits are conducted before guarantee issuance and every 2 years during the loan term. Before issuance of a loan guarantee under this section, and once every 2 years while the guaranteed loan is outstanding, the owner or operator of the facility must submit reports. The Secretary of Energy must provide Congress with annual reports on the activities of the Board until each guaranteed loan is fully repaid."
