    "content": "The purpose of this section is to prevent the abandonment of marginal oil and gas wells responsible for half of the domestic production of oil and gas in the United States by providing a tax credit for producing oil and gas from these wells. The marginal well production credit under section 38 provides a credit amount of $3 per barrel of qualified crude oil production and 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production. The credit amount is reduced as oil and gas prices increase. The reference price for qualified crude oil production is over $15 and $1.67 for qualified natural gas production. The reference price is based on the previous calendar year and is adjusted for inflation annually. The terms 'qualified crude oil production' and 'qualified natural gas production' refer to domestic crude oil or natural gas produced from marginal wells. Production from a well during a taxable year must meet certain criteria to qualify as such. The limitations on qualified crude oil and natural gas production apply if production exceeds 1,095 barrels or barrel equivalents in a taxable year. Proportionate reductions apply for short taxable years or wells not in production for the entire year. Definitions for qualified production are provided. Definitions for qualified production include the term 'marginal well' which refers to domestic wells with specific production criteria. The terms 'crude oil', 'natural gas', 'domestic', and 'barrel' are defined in section 613A(e). 'Barrel equivalent' is the conversion ratio of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil. For a marginal well with multiple owners, qualifying production attributable to the taxpayer is based on their revenue interest compared to all operating interest owners. Operating interest is required for any credit under this. The production credit is only applicable to the holder of an operating interest in the production. Production from nonconventional sources is excluded if the taxpayer claims a credit under section 29. The credit is treated as a business credit under section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit can be used against regular and minimum tax liabilities. The marginal oil and gas well production credit is subject to special rules. The credit can be applied separately and the limitation on the credit is reduced by the amount of the credit. The marginal oil and gas well production credit is subject to special rules and can be carried back for 10 years under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The marginal oil and gas well production credit can be carried back for 10 years under special rules in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Coordination with Section 29 allows for taxpayer election in certain cases. The Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow taxpayer election for certain cases, with a clerical amendment to the table of sections. The Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow taxpayer election for certain cases, with a clerical amendment to the table of sections. Effective December 31, 2001, amendments apply to production in taxable years. The section allows taxpayers to deduct geological and geophysical expenses for domestic oil and gas wells as ordinary business expenses in the year they are incurred. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provide for this election, with an effective date of December 31, 2001. The amendments made by this subsection apply to expenses paid or incurred after the enactment date. Taxpayers can elect to amortize suspended expenses over a 36-month period for expenses paid or incurred before the enactment date. Taxpayers can elect to expense delay rental payments for domestic oil and gas wells, treating them as deductions in the taxable year in which they are paid or incurred. This applies to payments incurred in connection with oil or gas development within the United States. The term 'delay rental payment' refers to an amount paid to defer drilling of an oil or gas well under a lease. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code allow for the amortization of suspended expenses over a 36-month period for payments made after the enactment of the Act. The suspended portion of expenses can be amortized over a 36-month period starting from the enactment of the Act."
