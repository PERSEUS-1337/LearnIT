    "content": "Genetic engineering involves introducing new traits to an organism, creating tolerance to herbicides, resistance to viruses, and altering yields and acidic content. Genetically engineered foods (GE foods), also known as genetically modified foods (GMO foods), are derived from these methods. Common GE plants include corn, canola, soybean, and cotton, used in various food products. The FDA and World Health Organization have found GE foods to be safe, but some oppose them and demand specific labeling requirements, which federal law does not impose. The public generally opposes GE foods and demands specific labeling requirements for food products containing GE ingredients. Federal law does not impose specific labeling requirements on GE foods, as they follow the same guidelines as non-GE foods under the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act. Several states, including Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine, have passed laws imposing specific labeling requirements on GE food. Vermont's GE labeling act will take effect on July 1, 2016. Both Connecticut and Maine have statutes that require labeling of genetically engineered (GE) food, but enforcement is contingent on a certain number of states passing similar legislation. Connecticut's law, enacted in 2013, mandates labeling of GE food as \"Produced with Genetic Engineering.\" Maine's law, enacted in 2014, requires labeling of GE food as well. Both laws include provisions for sanctions for non-compliance. Vermont's Act requires food produced with genetic engineering to be labeled for retail sale. The labeling must include phrases like \"partially produced with genetic engineering\" or \"may be produced with genetic engineering.\" Manufacturers cannot label GE foods as \"natural.\" The law exempts certain foods, such as alcoholic beverages and medical food, from these requirements. The state attorney general can enforce these provisions through civil actions. The state attorney general has the authority to enforce labeling laws for food produced with genetic engineering to promote public health and food safety. The statute aims to reduce consumer confusion, protect religious practices, and allow consumers to make informed decisions. In 2014, various associations filed a complaint in federal court to challenge Vermont's Act 120 on constitutional grounds. The plaintiffs challenged Vermont's Act 120 in court, claiming it violated the First Amendment, Commerce Clause, and preemption doctrine. They sought a preliminary injunction to stop the law from taking effect. Vermont filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing insufficient claims. The district court ruled against the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in April 2015. In GMA v. Sorrell, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against Vermont's Act 120 labeling requirements. The court found that the plaintiffs did not show irreparable harm and allowed Vermont to proceed with implementing the law. Vermont plans to implement Act 120's labeling requirements starting July 1, 2016. The plaintiffs have appealed the district court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, arguing that Act 120 violates their First Amendment right. The district court partially granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, allowing claims of First Amendment violations to proceed. The court ruled that the plaintiffs' claims regarding Act 120's First Amendment violations can proceed to trial. Specifically, the court found that the prohibition on using the term \"natural\" in GE labeling violates the First Amendment. The discussion focuses on the constitutional issues surrounding state GE labeling laws, including the evaluation of the plaintiffs' claims in the context of the defendant's motion to dismiss. These issues are not limited to Vermont's Act 120 but have broader implications for labeling laws. The discussion analyzes constitutional issues raised by plaintiffs in GMA v. Sorrell, focusing on the First Amendment and different levels of scrutiny in analyzing the constitutionality of state GE labeling laws. The court ruled that Act 120's prohibition on using the term \"natural\" in GE labeling violates the First Amendment. In the complaint against the State of Vermont, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and other plaintiffs claimed that Act 120's mandatory GE labeling requirements violate the Constitution's First Amendment. They argued that the act's restrictions on labeling words like \"natural\" punish truthful speech and compel manufacturers to convey opinions they disagree with, thus violating the First Amendment. The plaintiffs in the case against the State of Vermont argued that Act 120's mandatory GE labeling requirements violate the First Amendment by restricting commercial speech and compelling speech. The level of judicial scrutiny applied to these claims is debated, with courts generally considering laws restricting commercial speech under an intermediate level of scrutiny. Courts apply an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws restricting commercial speech, following a four-step analysis from Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York. The factors considered include whether the speech is protected by the First Amendment, if the government interest is substantial, if the regulation directly advances the interest, and if the restriction is necessary. The state law must directly advance the state interest and cannot regulate speech that poses no danger to that interest. The Supreme Court in Sorrell v. IMS Health applied heightened judicial scrutiny to a Vermont statute that restricted the sale, disclosure, and use of pharmacy records revealing prescribing practices. Vermont's statute targeted specific content and speakers, leading the Court to apply a stricter standard of review. The Supreme Court applied heightened scrutiny to Vermont's statute regulating speech based on disagreement with the message conveyed. The Court protected commercial speech to ensure the free flow of information, especially in public health. In GMA v. Sorrell, plaintiffs argued that Vermont's prohibition on using \"natural\" or similar terms on GE food labels violated the First Amendment. The district court disagreed with Vermont's argument that banning the use of \"natural\" on GE food labels is inherently misleading, stating that there is not enough evidence of deception to support such a restriction on commercial speech. The court found that the state failed to show that using \"natural\" with GE foods has actually misled consumers, and therefore, the prohibition may violate the First Amendment. The court found that the state cannot ban the use of \"natural\" on GE food labels as it is not inherently misleading and does not serve a substantial state interest. The lack of a clear definition of \"natural\" in the law makes the prohibition too broad and not necessary to achieve its goal. The court found Act 120's prohibition on using the term \"natural\" on GE food labels to be invalid under the First Amendment, questioning the state's interest in the ban. The plaintiffs' First Amendment claim against the statute may proceed to trial, suggesting similar bans at state and federal levels could be challenged. The First Amendment protects the right to speak freely and refrain from speaking. The Supreme Court has invalidated government attempts to compel speech, as seen in Wooley v. Maynard where a New Hampshire law requiring the display of a motto on license plates was deemed unconstitutional. The state's interests were not compelling enough to justify the requirement, as they could have been achieved through narrower means. This suggests that bans on using the term \"natural\" on labeling may be challenged as a violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has upheld commercial disclosure requirements, stating that advertisers have a minimal constitutionally protected interest in not providing specific factual information in their advertising. The Court ruled in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel that disclosure requirements must be reasonably related to the state's interest in preventing consumer deception. The Court upheld the state's law requiring contingent-fee advertisements to disclose a client's liability for costs, stating it is reasonably related to preventing consumer deception. The level of scrutiny for compelled speech, particularly commercial speech, was a key consideration in evaluating the plaintiffs' claim against Act 120's GE disclosure requirements. The court disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument for strict scrutiny regarding Act 120's GE disclosure requirement, stating that it does not constitute political speech or viewpoint discrimination. The court determined that intermediate scrutiny should not apply as the disclosure is factual commercial speech that serves a minimal state interest. The court upheld Act 120's mandatory GE labeling requirement as it involves factual commercial speech that serves a minimal state interest, not political speech or viewpoint discrimination. The disclosure of factual information related to ingredients in food transactions is deemed non-controversial and does not solely cater to consumer curiosity, thus failing First Amendment scrutiny. The Second Circuit found that Vermont's requirement to disclose the use of synthetic bovine hormone in milk was unconstitutional under the First Amendment due to lack of health or safety concerns, relying on consumer interest. The court in GMA v. Sorrell considered Act 120's focus on safety and environmental impact of GE foods, questioning if the Zauderer standard should apply to the disclosure requirement. The Supreme Court in Zauderer held that disclosure requirements are protected under the First Amendment as long as they are factual and serve a minimal state interest. The Supreme Court in Zauderer established that disclosure requirements are protected under the First Amendment as long as they are reasonably related to the state's interest in preventing consumer deception. The district court analyzed the reasonable relationship test in the context of Act 120's disclosure requirements, concluding that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims survived the motion to dismiss. The court determined that although Zauderer may apply, the question of a reasonable relationship is still a matter of law. The court held that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims regarding Act 120's disclosure requirements survived the motion to dismiss, allowing the claims to proceed to trial. The plaintiffs allege that Act 120 is preempted by federal laws, which can occur when state laws conflict with federal laws or when Congress explicitly preempts state law. Federal preemption is determined by Congress's intent, which can be found in the text of the laws. The court's primary inquiry for preemption claims is Congress's intent, which can be found through the text, structure, or purpose of the statute. The presumption is that state police powers are not to be superseded by federal law unless Congress clearly intended it. Food and beverage labeling typically falls within state regulation. The district court in GMA v. Sorrell analyzed three types of preemption: express, conflict, and field. The plaintiffs argue that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act preempts Act 120's labeling requirements. Express preemption is determined by the plain wording of the provision to ascertain congressional intent. The Supreme Court directs lower courts to focus on the plain wording of express preemption clauses to determine congressional intent. NLEA contains five clauses prohibiting states from enacting food labeling requirements different from FFDCA. The legislative history shows NLEA aims for national labeling standards. To succeed in an express preemption claim, plaintiffs must show Act 120's requirements differ from FFDCA and a specific FFDCA requirement has preemptive effect. The plaintiffs argued that Act 120's GE labeling requirements are not identical to the FFDCA mandatory labeling requirements, as the state's statute imposes additional and different labeling information. However, the district court disagreed, stating that the \"not identical\" language in NLEA does not extend the scope of the statute's preemption provision as far as the plaintiffs proposed. The court disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that Act 120's GE labeling requirements are not identical to the FFDCA mandatory labeling requirements. The court stated that the \"not identical\" language in NLEA does not broaden the scope of the statute's preemption provision as the plaintiffs suggested. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' express preemption claim under the FFDCA and NLEA, emphasizing that Act 120's labeling requirements do not conflict with federal law. Conflict preemption occurs when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements, or when state law obstructs the purposes of Congress. The Supreme Court has set a high threshold for preempting state law that conflicts with federal law, emphasizing that it is Congress's responsibility to preempt state law. Additionally, an express preemption provision does not rule out the possibility of implied conflict preemption. In a complaint against Vermont, plaintiffs argued that Act 120 conflicts with the purpose of the FFDCA. The court disagreed with the plaintiffs' arguments for finding preemption in the context of Act 120 conflicting with the purpose of the FFDCA. Despite acknowledging the economic arguments for national uniformity in labeling, the court emphasized the presumption against preemption in an area typically under state oversight. The court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that Act 120's labeling requirements conflict with federal law. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' conflict preemption claims regarding Act 120's labeling requirements, stating that they can coexist with federal regulations. Field preemption occurs when state law occupies a field reserved for federal regulation, with congressional intent needing to be clear and manifest. The court found no evidence of field preemption in this case. Courts consider the absence of congressional action and FDA policies significant in determining preemption of state law claims in the context of food labeling. The mere existence of a federal regulatory scheme does not imply preemption of state remedies. Courts rely on the presumption against preemption when analyzing field preemption in food labeling cases. For example, in Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp., the defendant claimed federal law preempted state consumer protection claims related to labeling. The court did not find field preemption in the case of plaintiffs' state consumer protection claims against Snapple's use of \"All Natural\" on labels. The Third Circuit emphasized that Congress has not regulated comprehensively in the food and beverage fields, and NLEA prohibits implied preemption. The plaintiffs did not allege field preemption against Vermont, and the district court stated they could not have reasonably alleged it. The district court emphasized that the plaintiffs could not have reasonably alleged field preemption against Vermont in their complaint. The court explained that Congress has not regulated food and beverage labeling comprehensively enough to completely preempt state laws. The court also highlighted the absence of congressional intent to supplant state law in this context, suggesting that a legislative change could signal a different intent. The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate commerce, and the Supreme Court has recognized a dormant Commerce Clause that limits state actions in this area. The U.S. Supreme Court has identified a negative implication in the dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening interstate commerce. If a state law directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, it is unconstitutional. In Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., the Court stated that if a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly, the state's interest must be legitimate and the burden on interstate commerce should not clearly exceed local benefits. The plaintiffs alleged that Act 120 violates the dormant Commerce Clause by favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. The plaintiffs challenged Act 120, claiming it discriminates against interstate commerce by imposing labeling requirements that burden out-of-state companies. The district court dismissed the Commerce Clause claims, stating that there was no evidence that Vermont enacted the law to favor in-state products over out-of-state ones. The court found no evidence of discrimination in Act 120, which aims to promote Vermont products without favoring them over similar products from other states. The prohibition on using \"natural\" on signage was not deemed discriminatory, leading to the dismissal of Commerce Clause claims regarding out-of-state companies. In American Booksellers Foundation v. Dean, the court noted that a statute regulating commerce outside the state's borders can violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The Second Circuit struck down parts of a Vermont statute prohibiting the transfer of sexually explicit material to minors over the Internet. The district court in the context of Act 120 stated that it burdens interstate commerce by requiring out-of-state commerce to be conducted at Vermont's direction. However, the court did not find this interpretation enough to support the plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claim. The court in Sorrell v. Act 120 did not find a burden on interstate commerce as the statute does not require nationwide changes to labeling practices for GE food manufacturers. The majority of the plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claims were dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim, except for the charge against Act 120's \"natural\" prohibition on signage and advertising. The court emphasized that potential changes to product labeling are not discriminatory under the dormant Commerce Clause, and rejected the idea of a \"patchwork of state labeling requirements\" due to lack of uniformity among states with GE labeling laws. The court in Sorrell v. Act 120 did not find a burden on interstate commerce as the statute does not require nationwide changes to labeling practices for GE food manufacturers. The majority of the plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claims were dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim, except for the charge against Act 120's \"natural\" prohibition on signage and advertising. The court emphasized that potential changes to product labeling are not discriminatory under the dormant Commerce Clause, and rejected the idea of a \"patchwork of state labeling requirements\" due to lack of uniformity among states with GE labeling laws. The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 (SAFLA) would impact state legislation regulating the labeling of GE foods, including Vermont's Act 120. Generally, SAFLA would establish different certification programs and labeling requirements under the oversight of both the FDA and the USDA. First, Section 101 of SAFLA would direct the FDA to continue its current premarket consultation process for food derived from new plant varieties, including GE plants. Under SAFLA, the FDA may require that the labeling of food produced from, containing, or consisting of a GE plant display a statement to inform consumers of a difference between food so produced and a comparable non-genetically engineered food. Under this proposed requirement, the FDA may require such labeling if the agency has determined that there is a material difference between the two foods and the disclosure of such difference is necessary to protect public health or to. SAFLA would amend the Plant Protection Act to create a notification program for GE plants in food, require evaluation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and establish a voluntary GE food certification program within the USDA. It would also deem a food misbranded if labeled as \"natural\" without FDA-defined terms. Additionally, SAFLA contains preemption provisions impacting state regulation of GE food labeling. SAFLA contains preemption provisions that could impact state regulation of GE food labeling, including a provision in Section 113 that prohibits states from imposing different safety requirements on GE foods reviewed under Section 111. Section 111 establishes a premarket notification program for GE plants, requiring approval by the Department of Health and Human Services before placing them in interstate commerce. Section 113 of SAFLA prohibits states from imposing additional safety requirements on GE foods reviewed under Section 111. It does not prevent states from creating laws that mirror federal standards or enforcing federal GE safety standards. SAFLA's Section 203 preemption provision prohibits states from requiring labeling of GE products in interstate commerce, with exceptions for voluntary programs. The savings clause in SAFLA allows states to establish voluntary programs for GE food labeling, as long as they follow federal standards. States have limited discretion in setting labeling standards, and cannot imply that GE products are safer or of higher quality. SAFLA's Section 303 includes an express preemption clause that prohibits states from imposing their own labeling requirements on food in interstate commerce. Section 303 of SAFLA prohibits states from imposing labeling requirements on food in interstate commerce that are not identical to federal standards. This provision may allow states to enforce federal standards with different or additional remedies, particularly regarding the use of the term \"natural\" on food labels."
