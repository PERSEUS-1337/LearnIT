    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The total cost of Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers would be $1.052 trillion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, would cost $1.052 trillion over 10 years. The net cost of the coverage provisions is estimated to be $891 billion. The bill focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers. Individuals would be required to maintain health insurance. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to raise revenues and mandates individuals to maintain health insurance. Employers must provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue would be implemented. Acceptable coverage would include plans offered through the Exchange, employer plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Exchange would be overseen by the Health Choices Administration and offer private plans alongside a public option. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. The Exchange, overseen by a Commissioner, would offer private plans and a public option. Subsidies for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level would be available only through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely with no changes. A Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program would encourage not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives. The bill would not affect specific service plans like dental or vision care. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. H.R. 3962 aims to reform health insurance by altering private health insurance markets, prohibiting exclusion based on pre-existing conditions, and changing how insurers function for individuals purchasing coverage directly or through small employers. The provisions would be effective starting in 2013, with a timeline for implementation outlined in the report. H.R. 3962 aims to reform health insurance by prohibiting exclusion based on pre-existing conditions and addressing adverse selection. Insurers may need to require individuals to purchase coverage to prevent only the sick from enrolling. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical and market reforms possible. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions like abortion and end-of-life care. These provisions are crucial for implementing the individual mandate and market reforms effectively. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with individuals and employers obtaining coverage through various methods. Approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured, and those purchasing health insurance in the private market fell into three segments: large group, small group, and nongroup markets. Large employers were able to secure lower premiums compared to small employers. Large employers offer coverage to over 95% of their employees, enjoying lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. They provide substantial subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthy and sick workers. States have experimented with creating platforms for comparing insurance plans and pooling risks, with some models proving more sustainable than others. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance also facilitate plan comparisons for individuals and small groups in most states. Small employers struggle to offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited risk pooling ability. Factors like being medically underwritten, lacking market power, and economies of scale hinder their ability to provide coverage. Purchasing insurance through larger pools could help lower premiums. Insurance carriers lack economies of scale, hindering small employers from offering affordable health insurance. Purchasing insurance through larger pools like an Association or Exchange could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or premium adjustments based on health status in the nongroup market, affecting premiums for healthy and sick individuals. Reforms in premium ratings could increase or decrease premiums based on age, health, and behaviors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. HIPAA mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups, ensuring acceptance for all applying small employers. In the small group market, all states require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to firms with 2-50 workers in compliance with HIPAA. Some states also require guaranteed issue policies for self-employed individuals. Premium rating rules vary among states, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating or rate bands. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in the nongroup market. Adjusted community rating prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, allowing it for other key factors like age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law mandates group health plans to restrict the exclusion period for preexisting health conditions. In the small group market, 21 states have stricter preexisting condition exclusion rules than the federal standard, while 42 states limit the exclusion period for preexisting conditions in the individual market. The discussion revolves around the regulation of preexisting health condition exclusions in health insurance plans, with a focus on the potential introduction of a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform. Proponents argue that a public option could offer lower costs and increased competition, while opponents raise concerns about unfair advantages and the potential impact on private plans in the market. Non-profit health insurance organizations have shown better performance in quality compared to for-profit ones. Studies have indicated that non-profits, including health maintenance organizations, score higher on quality measures. Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have also performed well. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations, including health insurance co-operatives. Congressional attention has focused on incentivizing the creation of new co-operatives to invest earnings back into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. Some argue for their benefits, while opponents question their affordability and success rates. Several provisions of a bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013, with administrative steps leading up to it. Prior to full implementation on January 1, 2013, some provisions include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program, requiring health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios, and submitting justifications for any premium increases. The bill aims to stabilize the individual market by requiring health insurance issuers to justify premium increases to the Secretary and states. It allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' plans and reduces the look-back period for pre-existing conditions. The bill also mandates coverage for congenital disorders, prohibits lifetime benefit limits, and limits rescission by insurers. The Secretary would issue guidance to limit insurer rescission of health insurance policies. H.R. 3962 includes a mandate for individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes various health plans and programs, with an additional tax for those without coverage. Individuals without acceptable health insurance coverage may face an additional tax, calculated based on their income or the national average premium. Some may receive subsidies, while others are exempt from the mandate. Employers must provide coverage or contribute to the Exchange. H.R. 3962 requires employers to offer health insurance to employees or contribute to the Exchange. Employers must provide coverage meeting essential benefits package requirements and contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan. Salary reductions cannot offset required contributions. Employers would automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. They must provide written notice of employee rights and obligations. Employers must show compliance with health participation requirements by providing specific information. The Secretary of HHS could terminate an employer's health insurance election for noncompliance. Employers with wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an excise tax. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer health coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can opt out of employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with the employer facing a payroll assessment. This assessment does not apply to employees covered as dependents in an Exchange plan. Certain small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit phases out as employee compensation and the number of employees increase. Highly compensated employees are not eligible for the credit. Adjustments for inflation will be made starting in 2013. The small business credit for employee health coverage is available for up to two taxable years, with a 50% credit towards costs. Highly compensated employees are not eligible, and adjustments for inflation will be made starting in 2013. The credit is part of the general business credit and is not refundable, only available to businesses with tax liability. New federal health insurance standards would apply to qualified health benefits plans, including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. The new federal health insurance standards require coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. Guaranteed issue means accepting every applicant, while guaranteed renewal allows for coverage renewal. These standards apply to all individual and group health plans, addressing pre-existing conditions and ensuring affordability. H.R. 3962 introduces new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers, including rules on premium variation based on age, rating area, and family enrollment. It also mandates coverage for dependent children up to age 27 and requires notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing 90 days in advance. H.R. 3962 mandates QHBPs to cover specific benefits, limit cost-sharing on preventive services, cap annual out-of-pocket expenses, and comply with network adequacy standards. It also requires plans to meet essential benefits criteria and be comparable to employer health plans. Individual policies issued after 2013 must be Exchange plans, while group plans must meet QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup policies can remain unchanged but must adhere to certain conditions. States can establish Health Care Choice Compacts for cross-state insurance sales. The Health Care Choice Compacts would allow states to facilitate the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines. The compacts would be subject to the laws of one primary state while preserving the authority of secondary states to enforce specific rules. Grants would be available for states to regulate health insurance coverage sold in secondary states. QHBPs would need to cover essential benefits, limit cost-sharing on preventive services, cap annual out-of-pocket spending, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent to employer health plans in 2013. The essential benefits package required for QHBPs includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and more. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes coverage for various medical services and supplies. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families, adjusted for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be determined by copayments, covering 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have different cost-sharing or benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans could offer cost-sharing levels below those specified for the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would make recommendations. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend essential benefits package standards for coverage in the Health Insurance Exchange, incorporating innovation and reducing health disparities. The Secretary must adopt or provide reasons for not adopting the recommendations within 45 days, with an initial set of benefit standards required within 18 days. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans, negotiate with plans, enforce requirements, and administer premium and cost-sharing credits. Under H.R. 3962, a federal Health Insurance Exchange would be established under a new independent agency, funded by taxes, penalties, and assessments. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, with the Commissioner approving state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. State-based Exchanges would be funded separately. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states, with the Commissioner presuming compliance for states operating an Exchange before January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange, with the public health insurance option and income-based credits available exclusively through it. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance. By 2019, 30 million people are projected to obtain Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee, Medicare, or Medicaid. Open enrollment would occur annually from September to November, with special enrollment periods available for certain circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet the employer mandate requirements by offering and contributing. Exchange-eligible employers can meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers with 25 or fewer employees were Exchange-eligible in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. Larger employers could be phased in based on the number of full-time employees. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. The new federal requirements for private health insurance plans include standardized cost-sharing options in four tiers: Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus plans. Plans must meet essential benefits package requirements with varying levels of cost-sharing. Premium-Plus plans offer additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. The Premium-Plus plan, a variation of the Premium plan, offers extra benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans in the Exchange must adhere to cost-sharing levels set by the Secretary, with a 10% variation allowed. H.R. 3962 establishes a public health insurance option through the Exchange, with eligibility for income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet all requirements applicable to Exchange plans. The public option in H.R. 3962 must meet Exchange plan requirements, offer Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus plans with geographically adjusted premiums. Limited start-up funding is available, to be repaid within 10 years. The Secretary negotiates payment rates for providers, subject to limits not lower than Medicare rates. Insolvency would prohibit federal funds. The public option in H.R. 3962 would have Medicare-participating providers unless they opt out. Physicians could be preferred or non-preferred providers, with different billing rules. The Secretary could use innovative payment methods and implement successful reforms. No-risk contracts could be used for administration. The Secretary can enter no-risk contracts for public option administration, similar to Medicare. Functions include payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and VA cost collection. Enrollment is voluntary, allowing individuals to choose Exchange plans over employer-sponsored insurance. Those opting for Exchange plans would pay 100% of the premium. Individuals, including Members of Congress, who opt for Exchange plans would be responsible for 100% of the premium. The bill mandates the establishment of a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program with $5 billion in appropriations for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. Grants and loans would support start-up costs and solvency requirements, with specific conditions for eligibility. The cooperative must not be affiliated with an insurance company before July 16, 2009, and must adhere to ethical standards. It focuses on issuing QHBPs through health insurance exchanges, is licensed in all states it operates, and is governed by member majority vote. The cooperative operates with a consumer-centric approach, using profits to lower premiums or improve benefits. Grants and loans prioritize statewide cooperatives. The Commissioner prioritizes grants and loans for cooperatives that operate statewide or have financial support from nongovernmental sources. Violations of the CO-OP program require repayment of funds. Premium and cost-sharing subsidies are available for individuals purchasing health insurance through the Exchange. Individuals eligible for premium credits in the Exchange can also receive cost-sharing credits. Starting in 2015, they can choose Enhanced or Premium plans but must pay additional premiums and won't qualify for cost-sharing credits. To be eligible for credits, individuals must be lawfully present in the US, have a MAGI below 400% of the FPL, not be enrolled in certain other health coverage, and not be eligible for Medicaid. The premium credit in the Exchange is based on an affordable premium amount for individuals to pay, calculated as a percentage of income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner adjusts percentages to maintain government versus enrollee premium contributions. The reference premium is the three lowest Basic plans in the area. The affordability premium credit is the lesser of the enrollee's premium exceeding the affordable amount or the reference premium exceeding it. The \"affordability premium credit\" is calculated based on how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount or how much the reference premium exceeds it. Premium percentage limits are established by the Commissioner on a linear sliding scale for individuals with family income between specified tiers. Assistance is also provided for cost-sharing, with reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums specified by the Commissioner to align with actuarial values in Table 3 for each income tier. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The out-of-pocket maximums for individuals would be doubled for family coverage, with limits increasing based on premium growth for Basic plans. The Commissioner has the flexibility to adjust amounts to meet actuarial values, and insurers would receive additional payments to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to raise revenue for expanded health insurance coverage, such as coordinating employer deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage with federal subsidies. This provision would raise $2.2 billion over a 10-year period according to recent estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to raise $2.2 billion over a 10-year period by limiting annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013. This provision affects tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs, impacting how workers can exclude medical expenses from income taxes. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 limits annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation. This provision is expected to raise $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs, another tax-advantaged account, allow individuals to fund unreimbursed medical expenses on a pre-tax basis. Unlike FSAs, HSAs can be rolled over, and distributions for qualified medical expenses are not taxable. Non-qualified distributions from HSAs are subject to a 20% penalty tax under H.R. 3962, expected to raise $1.3 billion over 10 years. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 includes provisions that modify tax-advantaged accounts, such as FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs. It limits annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013 and prohibits coverage of over-the-counter medications unless prescribed by a physician. The proposal also addresses state laws regarding abortion coverage and prohibits discrimination against health care entities. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It restricts the adoption of standards related to abortion in the essential benefits package. The Stupak Amendment adds further restrictions on the use of funds for abortions. The Stupak Amendment, adopted by a vote of 240-194, added restrictions on the use of funds for abortions under H.R. 3962. Funds cannot be used for abortions unless a woman's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment under H.R. 3962 restricts the use of funds for abortions, allowing separate coverage for elective abortions to be purchased with nonfederal funds. Premiums for abortion coverage must be paid entirely with non-H.R. 3962 funds, and Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide abortion services. H.R. 3962 allows states to receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws that meet certain requirements. These laws must improve the reliability of the medical liability system, encourage disclosure of healthcare errors, and maintain access to affordable liability insurance. The state law must include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and cannot limit attorneys' fees or impose caps on damages. The bill allows defendants to offer periodic payments of economic losses and legal fees to claimants within 180 days of filing a claim. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. A certificate of merit program requires testimony from a medical expert for medical malpractice suits. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws. The bill clarifies that it would not provide funds for incentive payments related to medical malpractice cases. Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must disseminate information on end-of-life planning and offer options for advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment. However, promoting suicide, assisted suicide, or hastening death is prohibited."
