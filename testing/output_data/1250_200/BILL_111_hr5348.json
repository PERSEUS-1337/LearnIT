The \"Federal Workforce Reduction Act of 2010\" includes provisions for a hiring freeze in Executive agencies during fiscal years with projected budget deficits. The President will establish a Federal workforce hiring pool for appointments in all agencies. The \"Federal Workforce Reduction Act of 2010\" allows Executive agencies to appoint individuals to positions if approved by the President through a request process with specific criteria and regulations. The \"Federal Workforce Reduction Act of 2010\" outlines the criteria for the President to approve requests from Executive agencies for appointing individuals to positions. The number of positions in the Federal workforce hiring pool starts at zero in fiscal year 2011 and increases by 0.50 for each vacant position while decreasing by 1.0 for each request for a full-time equivalent position. The President can waive the hiring restrictions in cases of emergency or national security concerns. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will implement this subsection, consulting with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
