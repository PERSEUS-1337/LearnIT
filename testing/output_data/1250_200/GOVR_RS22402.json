    "content": "The Department of Defense's budget for health care has more than doubled since FY2001, reaching over $44.8 billion in FY2009 and projected to grow to $64 billion by FY2015. Health-care expenses could constitute over 12% of the DOD's budget by 2015, potentially impacting spending on other defense programs. The Defense health system serves 9.3 million beneficiaries with various care options based on eligibility. Tricare offers various health care benefits for military personnel and their families, including Tricare Prime, Tricare Extra, Tricare Standard, and Tricare for Life (TFL). Retirees aged 65 and above are eligible for treatment in military medical facilities. As of 2007, 36% of Tricare beneficiaries were retirees under 65, 20% were TFL retirees, and 44% were active duty personnel and their dependents. Care is delivered through one of the four plans, with TFL serving as a supplemental payer to Medicare. Tricare offers various health care benefits for military personnel and their families, including Tricare Prime, Tricare Extra, Tricare Standard, and Tricare for Life (TFL). TFL serves as a supplemental payer to Medicare for care by licensed providers, with prescriptions available at military pharmacies or civilian pharmacies linked to DOD. Costs have increased due to trends in medical care delivery and the establishment of TFL in the FY2001 Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2001 Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398) increased costs by extending medical benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 (P.L. 109-364) provided expanded access to defense health care for non-active duty reservists. Tricare Prime co-payments were eliminated, and the catastrophic cap for retirees was lowered, raising costs for the DOD. Defense health care costs have also been impacted by the generous benefits provided with limited contributions and co-payments, focusing on care for dependents and retirees. In FY2007, DOD proposed changes to constrain health care costs by focusing on care for dependents, retirees, and Tricare beneficiaries who utilize professional care at higher rates due to lower out-of-pocket costs. Many retirees with civilian jobs choose Tricare over civilian plans, as employer supplements for Tricare beneficiaries are illegal. In FY2007, DOD proposed changes to constrain health care costs by focusing on care for retirees and their dependents. The proposal included charging annual enrollment fees for Tricare Standard and increasing fees for Tricare Prime. No changes were proposed for active duty military or retirees eligible for Medicare. DOD also recommended adjusting cost shares annually for inflation. The lack of adjustment to Tricare Prime enrollment fees since 1995 was seen as a factor in the current budgetary situation. The lack of adjustment to Tricare Prime enrollment fees since 1995 has contributed to the current budgetary situation. The Bush Administration's FY2008 and FY2009 budget submissions proposed assumed savings from benefit reforms and increased Tricare premiums. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended setting Tricare Prime premiums for single retirees under 65 at 40% of Medicare Part B premiums and Tricare Standard/Extra premiums at 15% of Part B premiums. Family rates would be double the single rate. Tricare Standard/Extra premiums for single retirees would be set at 15% of Part B premiums, with family rates at twice the single rate. Deductibles would be linked to Medicare rates, with copayments waived for preventive care and prescription drug payments limited to two thirds of average civilian copayments. Health care for retirees under 65 would be financed through accrual accounting. DOD endorsed some recommendations but not all, aiming to maintain a generous health care benefit with fair cost-sharing. The 2010 Budget did not propose increasing Tricare fees. The 2010 Budget submitted by the Obama Administration does not include proposals to increase Tricare fees. Secretary Gates expressed concern about rising healthcare costs within the DOD budget. The FY2010 Base budget request for military healthcare is $47.4 billion, with projections showing costs increasing by 5 to 7 percent annually through FY2015 without changes to the current fee and benefit structure. The continued growth in healthcare costs within the DOD budget is attributed to increased utilization of benefits, healthcare inflation, and expanded benefits authorized by Congress. Pentagon officials plan to offset these costs by highlighting cuts in weapons systems and military spending, potentially leading to an increase in Tricare fees. Congress will need to respond to this strategy. The system introduced in the mid-1990s may face Congressional response. Defense authorization acts from FY2007 to FY2009 prohibited DOD from increasing healthcare charges. Provisions were enacted to prevent civilian employers from incentivizing retired servicemembers to rely on Tricare. The FY2007 national defense authorization established a DOD Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care to examine and improve defense health care sustainability. The Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care recommended phased-in changes in enrollment fees and deductibles to restore cost-sharing relationships. GAO's report found that DOD had overestimated savings from higher cost-shares. The GAO report in May 2007 found that DOD overestimated savings from higher cost-shares, but proposed fee and deductible increases would save $2.3 billion over five years. Congress rejected fee increases for FY2009 but enacted preventive health measures to reduce future usage, including waiving copayments for preventive services and implementing a military health risk management project. A military health risk management project was conducted to evaluate incentives for healthy behaviors, including a smoking cessation program and a preventive health allowance demonstration project. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a cost of about $50 million per year for three years for these programs, with no projected savings. Reporting requirements were included to inform future policy decisions. Congress may revisit proposals for fee increases in defense health-care budgeting, with different approaches suggested such as a lump-sum payment for retirees to forego defense health care until age 65 or a \"cafeteria plan\" offering an annual cash allowance for health care. These options aim to reduce costs for the Department of Defense over the long term. The Tricare plan offers lower enrollment fees and higher co-payments and deductibles, allowing retirees to use funds for civilian health insurance or establish health savings accounts. This approach could reduce DOD's outlays by 25%. Some suggest readjusting budget categories to remove retiree health-care spending from defense appropriation acts. The Obama Administration has chosen not to propose Tricare user fee increases for FY2010. The Obama Administration has chosen not to propose any Tricare user fee increases for FY2010, but there may be potential cost savings in the Tricare program to restore funding for high profile weapons acquisitions. Retiree organizations argue that proposed fee hikes are unfair, especially for retiring servicemembers who have borne the costs of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The growth of military medical spending poses complex considerations, especially for retired servicemembers and their dependents. Health care after retirement is seen as a crucial incentive for those who have served in difficult and dangerous careers. However, some argue that defense funds are limited, and competing requirements exist. These issues have been ongoing since DOD proposed fee increases in 2006 and are expected to persist in the future."
