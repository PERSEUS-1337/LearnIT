    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, testing a novel transformer variant that outperforms the standard model. Character-level models work directly on raw characters, offering a more compact language representation and mitigating out-of-vocabulary problems. They are especially effective for multilingual translation, using the same character vocabulary for multiple languages. In this work, the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation is investigated. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called the convtransformer, which utilizes convolution for interactions among nearby character representations. Evaluation is done on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. The study evaluates self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a convtransformer with a standard transformer. Results show that self-attention models perform well for character-level translation, requiring fewer parameters. The convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer, converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) previously tackled fully character-level translation using a recurrent encoder-decoder model. The decoder network generates output translations character by character with attention on encoded representations. Multilingual training of character-level models is effective for languages with similar character vocabularies or through mapping to a common representation. Recent studies compare character and subword-level models, showing that character-level models can outperform with greater flexibility in processing sequences. The transformer model has achieved state-of-the-art performance. The convtransformer is a modification of the standard transformer architecture that aims to investigate character-level bilingual and multilingual translation. It uses self-attention and feedforward layers to process input sequences and generate output sequences. Recent studies have shown that attention can effectively model characters, leading to questions about the transformer's performance on character-level translation tasks. The convtransformer is a modification of the standard transformer architecture for character-level translation tasks. It includes additional sub-blocks in the encoder with parallel 1D convolutional layers of different context window sizes. The output dimensionality remains unchanged, and a residual connection is added for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on the WMT15 DE\u2192EN dataset to compare different model configurations. The study conducts experiments on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). Training corpora are constructed by sampling one million sentence pairs from the UN dataset in FR, ES, and ZH languages for translation to English. Multilingual datasets are created by combining bilingual datasets and shuffling them. The study compares different character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset for bilingual and multilingual scenarios. The experiments involve training models with single or multiple input languages without language identifiers. Results are presented in Table 1, showing the best overall performance for each language. The study compares character-level models trained on the WMT dataset, with transformers trained on subword level. Character-level training is slower but achieves strong performance, outperforming previous models. Multilingual experiments show the convtransformer outperforming the transformer on BLEU results. The convtransformer consistently outperforms the transformer on bilingual and multilingual translation tasks, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. Distant-language training can be effective but is most helpful when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities. The character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities. The bilingual models are considered to have greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments compared to multilingual models due to potential distractions from other input languages. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to quantify the alignments by sampling random sentences from UN testing datasets and projecting alignment matrices to a common vector space for correlation inference. The study analyzes character alignments in multilingual models using attention probabilities. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed to quantify alignments, showing strong positive correlation for similar languages but a drop when introducing a distant language. The convtransformer model proves more robust to distant languages compared to the transformer model. The study explores character-level translation using self-attention and convolution in the encoder. Results show competitive performance with subword-level models, especially for similar languages. Future work includes analyzing more languages and improving training efficiency. Model outputs and alignments are presented for bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets. In Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7, alignments from bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets are shown for FR to EN translation. The convtransformer exhibits sharper weight distribution for bilingual translation, while for multilingual translation of distant languages, convtransformer maintains better character and word alignments compared to the transformer. This suggests convtransformer's robustness for multilingual translation of distant languages. The convtransformer shows better word alignment for multilingual translation of distant languages compared to the transformer.
