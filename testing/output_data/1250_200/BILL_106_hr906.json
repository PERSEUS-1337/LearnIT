    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that the right to vote is fundamental to citizenship and must not be denied based on race, color, gender, or previous servitude. Congress has the authority to oversee Federal elections and discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in voting rights restoration. State laws regarding the restoration of voting rights after a felony conviction vary, leading to unequal treatment across the country. Disenfranchisement disproportionately affects ethnic minorities, with an estimated 3.9 million Americans unable to vote due to felony convictions. Congress must ensure that state laws align with the Constitution to prevent discrepancies in voting eligibility for federal elections. State laws vary on restoring voting rights after a felony conviction, with some states disenfranchising felons during prison, parole, and probation. Fourteen states disenfranchise ex-offenders even after completing their sentences. Three-fourths of the 3.9 million disqualified voters are not in prison. In states that disenfranchise ex-offenders, regaining the right to vote is often difficult, requiring a pardon or action from the Governor or parole board. In some states, ex-offenders face barriers to regaining voting rights, with Federal offenders needing a Presidential pardon. African American and Hispanic citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised, with Congress urged to address these discrepancies. The Act aims to address the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African American and Hispanic citizens in the criminal justice system, promoting fairness in Federal elections and the reintegration of former offenders into society. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS: Citizens of the United States have the right to vote in Federal elections, except for those serving a felony sentence in a correctional facility at the time of the election. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of this Act. Individuals can also take legal action if a violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"correctional institution or facility\" as a place for convicted individuals, excludes treatment centers. It defines \"election\" broadly to include various types of elections. \"Federal office\" refers to President, Vice President, or Senator. The term \"Federal office\" includes the President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress. SEC. 6 of the Act clarifies that states can enact laws allowing voting in federal elections with less restrictive terms than those in the Act.
