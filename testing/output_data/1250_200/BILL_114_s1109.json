    "content": "The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" requires federal agencies to provide information on settlement agreements. The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" mandates that federal agencies disclose details of settlement agreements meeting specific criteria, including those involving alleged violations of federal law or failures in the rule-making process, requiring payments of at least $1,000,000 by non-federal entities. The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" requires federal agencies to engage in rule-making processes and pay at least $200,000 in attorney fees to non-Federal entities. The term 'entity within the Federal Government' includes officers or employees acting officially, while 'non-Federal person' refers to those outside the government. The act also defines 'rule-making' as per section 551(5) and mandates Executive agencies to post settlement information online. The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" mandates Executive agencies to publicly list covered settlement agreements on their websites. The list must include the date of the agreement, names of the parties involved, description of settled claims, and the amount each party is obligated to pay. The covered settlement agreement requires parties to pay specified amounts, including penalties or fines, that are not deductible. The covered settlement agreement mandates non-deductibility of specified payments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It also requires disclosure of where collected amounts will be deposited, potentially for Federal Government programs, along with providing copies of the agreements. Confidentiality provisions apply to the disclosure requirement. The settlement agreement must be publicly available for a specified period, with information on a list for 5 years and a copy available for at least 1 year. Non-deductible payments are mandated, with disclosure of deposit locations for collected amounts, potentially for Federal programs. The head of an Executive agency may issue a public statement explaining the need for confidentiality in a covered settlement agreement to protect the public interest of the United States. The statement must justify why confidentiality outweighs the public's interest in knowing about Federal Government conduct and resource expenditure. Requirements for written public statements by Executive agencies regarding amounts to be paid under covered settlement agreements by non-Federal persons must specify if any portion is a penalty or fine for violating Federal law, not deductible for tax purposes, or neither, and detail actions the non-Federal person must take. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for disclosure of information under settlement agreements, detailing actions non-Federal persons must take and payments they must make. It also addresses confidentiality provisions and reporting obligations for Executive agencies. The curr_chunk requires Executive agencies to report to Congress on covered settlement agreements, including the number of agreements, confidentiality terms, attorney fees paid, and the number of agreements with non-Federal persons. The curr_chunk amends the reporting requirements for Executive agencies regarding settlement agreements with non-Federal persons involving regulatory action or changes. The reports must be made publicly available on the agency's website in a searchable format. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report to Congress on how Executive agencies determine the confidentiality of settlement agreements within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The report should include recommendations for increasing transparency while protecting legitimate interests."
