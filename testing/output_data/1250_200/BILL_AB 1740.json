    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares California's significant economic impact and leadership on national and global issues, emphasizing the need for informed policy decisions in rapidly evolving areas. The state's surplus of law school graduates could benefit government work, as only a small percentage of attorneys nationwide work for state governments. The California Law Fellowship Program is established to encourage attorneys and law school graduates to work in public sector positions within state government, with the aim of filling vacancies as older attorneys retire. The program offers limited-term placements and aims to transition participants into permanent public-sector employment. The California Law Fellowship Program, established to encourage attorneys and law school graduates to work in public sector positions within state government, requests The University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law to create and administer the program. Preference is given to current or former members of the United States military. Fellows will be placed with state agencies based on agency acceptance criteria. The California Law Fellowship Program aims to encourage attorneys and law school graduates to work in public sector positions within state government. Participation in the program by attorneys, state agencies, or public officials is not considered a gift of public money. State funds are not used to administer the program. The program is designed to accomplish the Legislature's intent and defines key terms such as \"California Law Fellow\" and \"Qualifying law school graduate.\" The California Law Fellowship Program, established under Chapter 1.5 of Division 1, provides public benefits to the Legislature. Participants in the program are not considered compensation or gifts to legislators. Participants in the California Law Fellowship Program, duly authorized by the Senate or Assembly Committee on Rules, are not considered employees of the Legislature. They must meet specific selection criteria and adhere to standards set by the Committees. The director has the authority to lease state-owned real property within the core area for purposes consistent with the Capitol Area Plan. This includes leasing portions of buildings to private parties and other public agencies for various uses. The lease terms and conditions are determined by the director, and any property leased for five years or more must follow a specific procedure for advertisement and awarding. The director may sell state-owned real property within the Capitol Area Plan area designated for residential and commercial purposes at fair market value to a joint powers authority for development. Sales must not reduce the number of dwelling units for low-income households as required by law. Units on sold land still count towards total units for low-income housing purposes. The director can sell state-owned properties in the Capitol Area Plan area to a joint powers authority for development, but not if it reduces low-income housing units. Existing residential properties managed by the joint powers authority cannot be sold unless it leads to a net increase in residential units on the site. The director cannot sell existing residential properties managed by the joint powers authority unless a deed restriction is recorded ensuring the property is used for residential purposes for at least 45 years. This restriction benefits the public and all parcels within the Capitol Area Plan. The director's authority in residential leases within the Capitol area includes preventing involuntary displacement of tenants after January 1, 1978. They can enter into long-term leases up to 60 years and allow financing by pledging or assigning these leases. The director must notify and provide an economic analysis to specific legislative members before executing certain agreements related to state-owned property in Sacramento or Yolo County. The notification period may be determined by the chairman of the committee. The Legislature aims to promote development in the Capitol Area Plan by allowing the director to sell property to a joint powers authority at fair market value. The Capitol Area Development Authority can request these sales with economic analysis to support the value, and the director may approve the sale if they agree with the analysis. The Legislature authorizes the director to lease residential units in the Capitol area to low or moderate-income individuals below market rates. Leases of state-owned property in the core area are subject to possessory interest taxes. Proceeds from the sale of state parcels are deposited into the General Fund."
