Congress acknowledges the significant role of volunteers in providing services to children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities through nonprofit organizations. However, there are concerns about the occurrence of abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, in various care settings. Such abuse not only harms the victims but also undermines public trust in these organizations. Congress has taken steps to address these concerns. Congress has addressed concerns about abuse in care settings by implementing the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. While state screening may be sufficient for volunteer background checks, national criminal history checks using fingerprints are often recommended. However, the high cost of fingerprint background checks can be prohibitive for organizations with many volunteers, potentially discouraging their participation. A national volunteer and provider screening center is necessary to streamline background checks for volunteers and protect vulnerable groups by providing efficient national criminal history checks at little to no cost.

SEC. 603 defines key terms. SEC. 603 defines key terms related to the Act, including 'qualified entity', 'volunteer provider', 'provider', 'national criminal background check system', and 'child'. The Act defines key terms such as 'child' as a person under 18, 'individuals with disabilities', 'State', and 'care' as the provision of services to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. The Act establishes a National Center for Volunteer and Provider Screening. The Attorney General will establish a national center for volunteer and provider screening to conduct nationwide background checks on individuals working with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities to ensure they are fit for their responsibilities. The center will access and review Federal and State criminal history records at no cost to qualified entities for volunteer providers and at minimal cost for providers. The Attorney General will establish a national center for volunteer and provider screening to conduct nationwide background checks on individuals working with vulnerable populations. The center will provide criminal background check results to qualified entities within 15 business days and serve as a national resource center for volunteer screening. Additionally, a National Volunteer Screening Task Force will be established to oversee this process. The Attorney General will establish a National Volunteer Screening Task Force with members from various federal and state agencies, as well as national organizations representing volunteers serving the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The Attorney General will appoint members to oversee the work of the Center and report annually to the President and Congress on compliance with the National Child Protection Act of 1993. Authorization of appropriations for background checks of volunteers working with vulnerable populations is provided in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. $80,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2005. The funds will remain available until expended. Requests for national background checks under this section are submitted to the National Center for Volunteer Screening, which conducts searches using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System or other criminal record checks. Qualified entities must provide fingerprints or identifying information and obtain a statement from the provider regarding their criminal record. The National Center for Volunteer Screening conducts criminal history background checks for providers or volunteers, who are notified of the process and their rights. Statements obtained are retained for at least 2 years. The National Center for Volunteer Screening conducts criminal history background checks for providers or volunteers, who have the right to challenge the accuracy of the information. The National Center determines if the criminal history renders the provider unfit to care for children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. The National Task Force on Volunteer Screening, chaired by the Attorney General, provides guidelines for conducting criminal background checks and making fitness determinations for care providers. A qualified entity is not liable for not requesting a background check on a provider.

A qualified entity is not liable for failure to take adverse action against a provider who was the subject of a criminal background check. The National Center or a qualified entity that relies on criminal history record information received in response to a background check shall not be liable for inaccuracies. Fees for background checks conducted through the National Center for volunteers with a qualified entity are free if required by a State after December 20, 1993. This does not affect the authority to collect fees for checks on paid employees. Establishment of a model program in each state to strengthen criminal data repositories and fingerprint technology. A model program will be established in each state and the District of Columbia to improve fingerprinting technology. Each state will receive $50,000 to purchase Live-Scan fingerprint technology or electric fingerprint imaging machines. Additional funds will be provided to hire personnel for training on National Child Protection Act requirements. The National Child Protection Act of 1993 requires states to input criminal data, child abuse crime information, domestic violence arrests, and stay-away orders of protection into the national criminal history background check system. $5.1 million is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with additional funding for fingerprint technology units and data entry improvement personnel in each state and the District of Columbia."
