    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with provisions from S. 1253 inserted. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be resolved in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authority. The White House has criticized aspects of both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012, threatening to veto any legislation that challenges the President's critical authorities in collecting intelligence and protecting the nation. The bills aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President after 9/11, with strong opposition to provisions mandating military detention or limiting executive discretion in prosecuting terrorist suspects. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) granted the President authority to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks and prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals have been detained to prevent terrorist activities, with some facing trial in military or civilian courts. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld allowed for the detention of enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan. The AUMF grants the President authority to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The D.C. Circuit has generally supported the government's detention authority under the AUMF, with the possibility of Supreme Court review. Congress has not passed any legislation to assist the courts in this matter. The D.C. Circuit has endorsed the government's authority to detain individuals under the AUMF, focusing on those associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Most detainees are captured during military operations in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay. Many individuals suspected of terrorist activity were detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba or in Parwan, Afghanistan. Those captured in Afghanistan are held in Parwan, while detainees outside of Afghanistan are handled ad hoc. In the United States, suspects are typically prosecuted in federal court rather than placed in military detention under the AUMF, except for rare cases where individuals were designated as \"enemy combatants.\" The detainees, labeled as \"enemy combatants,\" were a U.S. citizen arrested for alleged Taliban involvement in Afghanistan and a legal resident accused of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent.\" They were transferred to civilian authorities for trial amid legal uncertainty. There is ongoing debate over whether suspected terrorists should be held in military custody or tried in civilian courts. The debate over how to handle suspected terrorists continues, with arguments for military commissions, civilian trials, or executive discretion. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for trial in 2011. The 2012 Minibus Act extended these restrictions. The 2012 Minibus Act extends funding restrictions preventing Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for trial, making military commissions the only viable option for prosecuting detainees. Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame faced terrorism charges in a civilian court after being detained on a US naval vessel for interrogation. The controversy surrounding the detention and interrogation of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame on a U.S. naval vessel for two months by military and intelligence personnel has sparked debates on whether he should have been held in military custody abroad or transferred to civilian custody immediately. Similar debates arose with the arrests of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, questioning whether they should have been detained and interrogated by military authorities. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda and imposes restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House criticized provisions on detainee matters and threatened to veto the bill. S. 1253 from the Senate Armed Services Committee authorizes detention of certain persons and requires military detention for some, regulating status determinations for those held under the AUMF. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions, despite objections from the White House and Department of Defense. The bill clarified the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions related to the conflict with Al Qaeda. Differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will be discussed in conference. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities regarding detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA is addressed, including detention authority under the AUMF, status determinations, periodic reviews, and concerns about detainee recidivism. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detaining individuals linked to Al Qaeda or affiliated groups. The Obama Administration defined its detention authority under the AUMF to include those involved in the 9/11 attacks, supporting Taliban or Al Qaeda forces, or engaging in hostilities against the US. Membership in these groups is a key factor in determining detention authority. The AUMF is the legal basis for detaining individuals linked to Al Qaeda or affiliated groups, including those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Taliban or Al Qaeda forces. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the concept of \"substantial support\" in the executive's detention authority raises questions about exceeding the AUMF's mandate. The government has not clarified the precise nature of \"substantial support\" or the characteristics of \"associated forces\" that would warrant detention. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support\" for individuals to be treated as enemy combatants. Recent court decisions focus on proof of detainee association with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, following the AUMF authorization for enemy combatant detention. The full parameters of detention authority under the AUMF are still being defined by lower courts. The AUMF grants the United States authority to detain individuals associated with organizations beyond just al-Qaida or the Taliban, including those who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in traditional armed conflicts. This authority extends to individuals captured in Afghanistan who are considered part of an \"associated force.\" The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with certain groups automatically qualifies individuals as enemy combatants. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) made one petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court found that the government's evidence did not support the criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" as defined by the government. The government had defined \"associated force\" as being closely associated with al Qaida or the Taliban and engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The court noted that this definition would require a close operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" as defined by the government. The term \"associated forces\" has only been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in habeas cases so far. The AUMF has been applied to various groups in Afghanistan, such as \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\"). The detention of individuals associated with the 55th Arab Military Brigade has also been affirmed. There is uncertainty about applying the AUMF to groups outside Afghanistan, especially concerning U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF remains a topic of debate. The AUMF has been applied in Afghanistan to various groups, but there is uncertainty about its application to individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals has taken the view that the AUMF allows for the detention of individuals functionally part of Al Qaeda, even if captured outside the U.S. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. The AUMF has been used to detain individuals captured in the U.S. under the authority of the Supreme Court. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) were established by the Pentagon to determine enemy combatant status of Guantanamo detainees. CSRTs confirmed 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to fewer detainees brought to Guantanamo. The CSRT process at Guantanamo has been inactive since 2007 due to fewer detainees. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have fewer procedural rights. President Obama created task forces to study detention policies. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for detainees not deemed to warrant continued detention. Detainees have the right to challenge their detention and present evidence in a hearing before the PRB. The process is discretionary and does not create new detention authority. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for assessing detainee cases at Guantanamo. Concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activities have led to limits on transfers, with post-release statistics being classified. Some former detainees have been involved in terrorist activities, sparking debate on the significance and policy implications. The Pentagon's release in 2007 estimated that 30 former Guantanamo detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged these numbers, citing discrepancies in the data and lack of identifying information for verification. They also disputed the classification of these activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement.\" The Pentagon released data from CSRT hearings regarding detainee activities, suggesting post-release terrorist conduct could be due to radicalization during internment. Reports in 2008 and 2009 confirmed ex-Guantanamo detainees engaging in terrorism. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the DNI to make public an unclassified summary of recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The report released in December 2010 assessed recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. Of the 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 confirmed and 3 suspected detainees engaged in terrorism. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned. The America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports and estimated that 6% of released detainees posed a threat to the US. The discrepancy in detainee recidivism numbers remains unexplained due to classified intelligence data. There is agreement that the number of detainees engaging in terrorism post-release has increased. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens or non-US Armed Forces members in custody of the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" in H.R. 1540 is broadly defined to cover detainees under the effective control of the Department of Defense, including foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for various reasons. The provision does not limit the term to those detained under the AUMF, potentially covering detainees found not to be enemy belligerents but still held at Guantanamo. The term \"effective control\" may extend beyond physical custody, possibly involving supervision by DOD even if the detainee is technically in another agency's custody. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. It permits the death penalty in cases where the accused pleads guilty, as long as the military commission panel members unanimously approve the sentence. Additionally, pre-trial agreements are addressed, allowing for a reduction in the maximum sentence. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, with the death penalty permitted if the accused pleads guilty and panel members unanimously approve the sentence. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, affirming the President's authority to detain captured belligerents and use necessary force. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. This provision has sparked controversy, with supporters arguing it aligns with the 2001 AUMF, while opponents fear it expands the armed conflict without a direct nexus to the 9/11 attacks. The proposed language in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to use force against any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, sparking concerns about the removal of limits on identifying parties to the armed conflict. The proposed language in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to target entities that have engaged in or supported hostilities with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces, potentially broadening the scope of belligerents in armed conflicts. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 reaffirms the current interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in targeting decisions related to Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The House Armed Services Committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the AUMF to address the evolving threat posed by these groups. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, specifically regarding the term \"associated forces\" and its potential expansion of authority under H.R. 1540 Section 1034. The interpretation aligns with Congress's intent to address the evolving threat posed by Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The language in paragraph (3) of H.R. 1540 Section 1034 could potentially supersede the AUMF and impact the interpretation of \"associated forces\" in detainment cases. The White House strongly objects to this section, arguing that it would redefine the scope of the conflict. The White House strongly objects to Section 1034 of H.R. 1540, stating that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees, with differences from the previous process. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on a review process for Guantanamo detainees, including full reviews every three years and more limited reviews annually. The process excludes detainees undergoing trial or serving a sentence, or those ordered released by a federal court. A panel of military officers conducts the reviews, with detainees allowed to have a military representative advocate on their behalf. The detainee, with appropriate security clearance, can advocate before a panel on their behalf. They can present a statement, evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. The detainee receives an unclassified summary of information considered by the panel, and their representative gets a copy of the government's submission. Outside parties, including private counsel, can provide written submissions with detainee authorization. The limited annual file review considers new information on the threat posed by the individual. The military panel reviews new information on the threat posed by Guantanamo detainees to determine if continued internment is necessary. Factors considered include the likelihood of terrorist activity upon release, ties to hostile organizations, behavior in custody, mitigating information, and intelligence value to national security. The interagency review board, composed of senior officials from various government departments, is responsible for reviewing the military panel's recommendations on Guantanamo detainees. If the board disagrees with a recommendation, it can reject it by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board must find a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review board, composed of senior officials, reviews military panel recommendations on Guantanamo detainees. The criteria for review are similar to those for Guantanamo transfer decisions. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 potentially leading to a presidential veto. The President's periodic review system is criticized for potentially limiting advice from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, hindering informed decision-making on national security. Section 1039 restricts the transfer of non-citizen detainees into the US, impacting Guantanamo closure efforts. Congress enacted funding measures to limit executive discretion in detainee transfers. The funding restrictions, including those in the 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55), prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by plans to transfer detainees for trial in civilian courts, making military commissions the only viable option for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 covers a broader category of detainees for the duration of FY2012. The funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 cover a broader category of detainees for FY2012, including non-citizen detainees held at Guantanamo and those held by military authorities at foreign locations. These restrictions prohibit the transfer or release of detainees into the United States, but do not limit detainees from being brought into the country by other government agencies. These restrictions will expire at the end of FY2012. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which restricts the transfer or release of detainees into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this provision interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts, hindering national security efforts. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring detainees to foreign countries unless certain criteria are met. These restrictions do not apply if a court orders the detainee's release. The restrictions in Section 1040 limit funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met, with concerns over possible recidivism. No detainee has been released since the 2011 NDAA and CAA went into effect, raising questions about the impact of these restrictions on detainee transfers. The lack of subsequent detainee transfers is unclear. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that the destination country meets specific criteria for a transfer to occur. These requirements are similar to those considered by the interagency review board. Section 1040 requires certification for detainee transfers, similar to previous legislation. It adds a new condition for access to transferred individuals and prohibits transfers to countries with former detainees engaging in terrorism. The White House opposes these restrictions, citing interference with foreign policy decisions. The Administration argues that requirements in Section 1035 interfere with its ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations swiftly and flexibly. This section mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days, outlining limitations, privileges, and enforcement measures related to legal representation and communications. It also requires monitoring procedures to protect national security while preserving detainee privileges during legal proceedings. Section 1038 prohibits DOD funds in FY2012 from allowing family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts rights for repatriated detainees in certain countries under the Compact of Free Association. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, potentially affecting travel to the US for former detainees. Section 1043 restricts rights for repatriated detainees in certain countries under the Compact of Free Association, potentially affecting travel to the US for former detainees. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission, a provision opposed by the White House. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission, a provision opposed by the White House. Opposition claims it could undermine interagency coordination and cause delays in taking individuals into custody. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried only by military commission, but the provision lacks clear definitions. The provision in question relates to terrorist attacks within the United States or against U.S. government property abroad. It is unclear if it applies to prospective attacks that are not carried out. The definition of a \"terrorist attack\" is ambiguous. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight. If the criteria are met, the offense must be one that can be tried by a military commission under the MCA. The accused must be subject to military commission jurisdiction, with a connection to hostilities established. Military commissions can only have jurisdiction over non-U.S. citizens who are unprivileged enemy belligerents. The bill expands the definition of unprivileged enemy belligerents to include individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda. It is unclear how these criteria will be determined, but military commissions or Article III courts could make jurisdictional decisions. The provision applies to foreign nationals in US custody and could complicate extradition of terrorism suspects. The provision in the bill expands the definition of unprivileged enemy belligerents to include individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda. It applies to foreign nationals in US custody and could complicate extradition of terrorism suspects. The provision does not outright preclude trials in Article III courts for the individuals it describes, but states they shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. The provision in the bill expands the definition of unprivileged enemy belligerents to include individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda. It applies to foreign nationals in US custody and could complicate extradition of terrorism suspects. Individuals shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions, with potential challenges to jurisdiction in Article III courts. Executive branch officials have criticized this provision for limiting prosecutorial discretion. Section 1032 extends the authority to provide rewards for information on terrorism for two years. Section 1041 requires quarterly briefings on global counterterrorism operations. Section 1044 expresses congressional support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency planning to deny safe havens to terrorist groups. Section 1045 requires the President to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to terrorist groups and strengthening \"at-risk states.\" It mandates the submission of guidance documents to Congress and the establishment of memorandums of understanding among agencies involved. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, with provisions similar to S. 1253 but revised to address Administration concerns. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with a single amendment clarifying detainee provisions. The bill affirms the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda without modifying existing authorities. H.R. 1540 was subsequently passed with the language of S. 1867. Section 1031 of the bill affirms the AUMF includes authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. Covered persons are defined as those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. The earlier version authorized detention of these individuals until the end of hostilities. The White House objected to language limiting detentions. The White House objected to language in the bill that could limit detentions to those captured during military operations. Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to a foreign country, without specifying if U.S. citizens or resident aliens are included. The revised provision of S. 1867 aims to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority under the AUMF, sparking significant debate on its potential application to U.S. persons within the United States. An amendment to prevent long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was considered. The Senate debated amendments regarding the detention of U.S. citizens in military custody. An amendment to prevent long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was rejected. However, a proviso was added to Section 1031 to clarify that existing laws relating to detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens remain unchanged. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi allowed for the military detention of individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but the issue of detaining individuals captured in other locations remains unresolved. The circumstances of preventive military detention for persons captured in locations other than the U.S. have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify the detention of U.S. citizens or residents in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on its application. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies, including with respect to \"organizations, entities, and individuals considered to be 'covered persons' under section 1031(b).\" The Administration has not raised specific objections but cautions against codification of existing authorities, stating it poses some risk and could lead to legal questions that distract from national security efforts. Section 1032, which mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, has sparked controversy. Section 1032 of the revised provision in S. 1867 requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities authorized by the AUMF. It defines \"covered persons\" as those determined to be part of Al Qaeda or an associated force. Persons determined to be part of Al Qaeda or an associated force and involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the US or its partners must be detained by military authorities. They can be held in military detention, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or handed over to a foreign government, subject to specific transfer requirements. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" and outlines detention authority. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies detention authority to members of \"associated forces\" acting in coordination with or directed by Al Qaeda. The provision does not mention the Taliban, suggesting they may not be treated as associated with Al Qaeda unless their actions are coordinated with them. The question arises if an associated force acts independently but coordinates with Al Qaeda, whether all members are subject to mandatory detention. This determination could be based on the specific attack the individual is involved in. The detention authority under Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" coordinating with or directed by Al Qaeda. The provision does not mention the Taliban, implying they may not be considered associated with Al Qaeda unless their actions are coordinated. The definition of an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is ambiguous, potentially covering attacks in military operations or broader terrorist acts. The application of the law of war to such circumstances is uncertain. The application of the law of war to uncertain circumstances, such as bringing down a civilian airliner, raises questions about what constitutes an \"attack against the United States.\" S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to report on procedures for implementing the detention provision, including designating who is a covered person and preventing the interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering. The procedures for implementing the detention provision in S. 1867 include preventing the interruption of ongoing surveillance or intelligence gathering for individuals not in US custody, ensuring no disruption to interrogation sessions, and allowing waiver authority for transferring detainees from third countries if needed. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036 for status determinations of persons detained under the AUMF. The bill does not preclude multiple processes for determining detainability under the AUMF, including potential use of a single procedure for both detainment and disposition under the law of war. Any process adopted would likely involve constitutional due process requirements and could be challenged through habeas corpus, especially for detainees in the United States. Section 1032 does not prohibit Article III trials. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, as it could complicate prosecution and limit counterterrorism tools. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta also criticizes the provision for not clearly limiting its scope to persons captured abroad and for unnecessary complications in interpretation and implementation. The White House strongly opposes Section 1032 of the bill, calling it an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. They doubt that the revisions to the provision will fix its fundamental problems and criticize the requirement for the President to develop procedures to prevent interruptions in interrogations. The White House opposes Section 1032 of the bill, citing it as an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority in defending against terrorist threats. They criticize the requirement for the President to develop procedures to prevent interruptions in interrogations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on using military funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the destination country or entity meets certain criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees. These criteria include not being a designated state sponsor of terrorism, maintaining control over detention facilities, taking measures to prevent threats to the US, and sharing relevant information with the US. The Senate bill does not require certification from the Secretary of Defense regarding the receiving foreign entity. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the receiving foreign entity agrees to permit U.S. authorities access to transferred individuals. Transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country are generally prohibited if a previously transferred detainee has engaged in terrorist activity. Certification requirements and recidivism bars can be waived by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence if alternative actions address the purpose. The Senate bill allows for waivers of certification requirements and recidivism bars for transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries if alternative actions address the purpose. Waivers must be in the national security interests of the United States and require notification to congressional defense committees. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions apply to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It remains to be seen if the restrictions cover foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of the transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 imposes certain requirements. The Department of Defense disapproves of the Senate provision regarding the use of funds for Guantanamo Bay detainees' housing. Section 1034 imposes restrictions on constructing or modifying facilities for detention without Congressional authorization. The White House objects to these restrictions, which were not included in the House-passed version of the 2012 NDAA. The Senate bill on the 2012 NDAA does not prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US, allowing for transfers to civilian law enforcement for prosecution. It also does not prevent the release of cleared detainees into the US. Section 1035 clarifies detention review procedures at Guantanamo without replacing the existing periodic review process. Section 1035 of the 2012 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees outlining procedures for review panels established under Executive Order 13567. The provision clarifies that the purpose of periodic reviews is to assess if a detainee poses a threat to US security, gives the Secretary of Defense final decision-making authority on detainee release or transfer, and lists factors to consider such as likelihood of terrorist activity resumption. The Administration opposes this provision for shifting responsibilities to the Defense Department. The Administration objects to a provision in the 2012 NDAA that shifts responsibility for detainee review to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF. It is unclear if this refers to determining if a detainee is a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or their disposition under the law of war. The provision also outlines procedures for the determination of status for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. The provision in the 2012 NDAA shifts responsibility for detainee review to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including procedures for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. This provision may afford detainees in Afghanistan greater privileges during status determination hearings. It is unclear how this provision would affect detainees currently held at Guantanamo or habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The provision in the 2012 NDAA shifts responsibility for detainee review to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including procedures for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees are uncertain, as it is unclear how this provision would affect detainees currently held at Guantanamo or habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The 2012 NDAA allows for the disposition of captured unprivileged enemy belligerents under Sections 1031 and 1032. This may involve multiple status determinations for long-term detention, without military counsel or a military judge present. Section 1036 requires a status review process for detainees already designated for long-term detention. Section 1036 of the 2012 NDAA may only apply to detainees already designated for long-term detention, allowing for status reviews through existing military processes. The White House opposes this provision, citing conflicts with established detainee review procedures. Section 1037 permits plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540."
