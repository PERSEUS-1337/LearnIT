The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial for the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes ecosystem, with a focus on a holistic approach. The Detroit River contributes 90% of the flow to the western basin. The western basin of Lake Erie is an important ecosystem with diverse plant and wildlife species, supported by the Detroit River and coastal wetlands. It houses the largest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, including Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes. The wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie are crucial for waterfowl habitat, serving as a stopover for migrating ducks like bufflehead and common goldeneye. The area is also home to diverse bird species and is internationally recognized with the Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges. Lake Erie is internationally important, known for fishing, boating, birding, and tourism generating $1.5 billion in sales and 50,000 jobs. The western basin is a key area for fishing walleye, driving Ohio's $2 billion sport fishing industry. Coastal wetlands in the basin have faced pressure for 150 years, once part of a larger marsh system. Coastal wetlands along Lake Erie have significantly decreased in size over the years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. The development of Monroe, Michigan has particularly impacted the wetlands at the mouth of the Raisin River, leaving only about 100 hectares unaltered. The quality of remaining wetlands has been degraded by various stressors like sediments, nutrients, contaminants, and exotic species. Coastal wetlands along Lake Erie have significantly decreased in size over the years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. Protective peninsula beach systems, such as Bay Point and Woodtick, have been eroded, exacerbating erosion along shorelines and impacting breeding and spawning grounds. The Act defines key terms such as \"Refuge Complex\" as Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"International Refuge\" as Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. It also includes provisions for the expansion of boundaries. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex are expanded in Ohio and the southern boundary of the International Refuge is extended in Michigan. The Secretary may make boundary revisions as needed. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex in Ohio and the southern boundary of the International Refuge in Michigan are expanded. The Secretary will keep the map available for inspection in appropriate offices. The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange with consent of the owner. Federal properties within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary's jurisdiction for administration purposes. The Secretary administers federally owned lands within the Refuge Complex in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. The Complex is managed for the primary purpose of providing habitats for migratory birds and wildlife, as well as for resource conservation and education programs. The curr_chunk focuses on conserving, enhancing, and restoring habitats for migratory birds and wildlife in the western basin of Lake Erie. It also aims to promote partnerships among various organizations and advance goals outlined in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of goals in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002 to protect and restore the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. It emphasizes priority uses such as hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education on the Refuge Complex. Cooperative agreements regarding non-Federal lands are also highlighted. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with Ohio, Michigan, or any political subdivision for managing lands within the Refuge Complex. Encouragement is given for the use of existing greenway authority for funding trails in the area. The Secretary will conduct a study of fish and wildlife habitat at dredge spoil disposal sites near Toledo Harbor. A report will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. Authorization of appropriations is given for land acquisition, development, and maintenance of the Refuge Complex, as well as for the study mentioned."
