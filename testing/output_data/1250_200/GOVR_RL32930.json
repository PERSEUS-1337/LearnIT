    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, governs labor-management relations in the private sector by improving workers' bargaining power. It allows workers to join or form a union, bargain collectively over wages and conditions, and protects their right not to join. Employers must bargain in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The NLRA protects workers' rights to join or not join a union and requires employers to bargain in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The act defines unfair labor practices and does not apply to certain groups like railroads, airlines, and government workers. The NLRB administers the NLRA and resolves disputes related to union activities, bargaining units, and unfair labor practices. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union based on a \"community of interest\" regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. It may include employees of one employer, establishment, or occupation. Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees. The NLRB settles disputes over the appropriate bargaining unit. In a case involving certified nursing assistants (CNAs) at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, the NLRB found the group eligible to be represented by a union. The CNAs at the Specialty Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center of Mobile, AL, petitioned to be represented by the United Steelworkers. The NLRB Regional Director found the CNAs to be an appropriate bargaining unit. The CNAs assist residents with daily functions, wear nursing uniforms, and work under licensed practical nurses. The employer argued that other nonprofessional service and maintenance employees should be included in the bargaining unit. The board voted in favor (3-1) of the CNAs, determining that the CNAs' petitioned-for bargaining unit was appropriate. They share a community of interest due to their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. The CNAs were found to share a community of interest based on their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. Employers have specific rules for campaigning against unionization, including holding captive audience meetings and providing information to employees. Employees can campaign for union support from coworkers during work hours in both work and nonwork areas. They can distribute union literature in nonwork areas if not allowed in work areas. Using employer's e-mail for union activities depends on allowing it for other causes. Union organizers cannot conduct campaigns on company property. Union organizers have restrictions on conducting organizing campaigns on company property. They can use other means to reach employees and may be allowed in the workplace under certain conditions. Organizers can meet with employees on union property, distribute literature on public property, and contact employees at home. Employers cannot interfere with employees' rights to form or join a union, including threatening job loss or benefits for union support. Employees have the right to form or join a union without employer interference. Employers cannot threaten job loss, benefits, or plant closure to discourage unionization. Both employers and unions must bargain in good faith regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss for lack of support, or cause discrimination. Unions also cannot boycott or strike an employer related to the one they are organizing. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) governs the relationship between employers and employees, ensuring the right to form or join a union without interference. Unfair labor practices can be filed by various parties, leading to investigations by the NLRB. If violations are found, remedies can include cease-and-desist orders and reinstatement of employees wrongfully terminated for union activities. The NLRA aims to prevent and address unfair labor practices without punitive measures. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay was awarded for unfair labor practices related to union activities. Estimates suggest 1,000 to 3,000 workers are illegally fired for union activities annually. Kate Bronfenbrenner found that 25% of union campaigns result in workers being fired. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and was 21,629 in FY2012, with 36.4% found to have merit. Section 9(a) of NLRA addresses union selection. In FY2012, 36.4% of unfair labor practice charges were found to have merit. The NLRA states that a union may be designated for collective bargaining by a majority of employees. There are three ways for employees to join or form a union: through NLRB election, employer recognition, or NLRB order. Certification through a secret ballot election or employer recognition is required for collective bargaining to begin. Certification of a union through a secret ballot election conducted by the NLRB is advantageous over employer recognition. A petition can be filed by a union, worker, or employer, with at least 30% of employees' authorization. If a majority of employees voting in the election choose union representation, the NLRB certifies the union as the bargaining representative. Certification does not require an initial contract agreement. The NLRA does not specify a timeline for holding an election. After a petition is filed for a union election, the employer and union may agree on details. If no agreement is reached, a hearing may be held by the NLRB. The regional director may order an election, which can be appealed. In a secret ballot election, employees choose union representation. Challenges to voting rights can be made, and objections to the election can be filed. The regional director's decisions can be appealed to the board. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for union certification and decertification. A decertification petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees in the bargaining unit. A certified union is protected from decertification for a year. In 2011, the NLRB proposed changes to procedures for union representation petitions and secret ballot elections. The NLRB made changes to procedures for filing union representation petitions, conducting secret ballot elections, and resolving challenges. The final rule issued on December 22, 2011, allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to the question of representation. The rule also consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review of decisions by regional directors. The December 22, 2011 rule consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review of decisions by regional directors. Requests for review will now be filed after an election, with special permission granted only in extraordinary circumstances. The 25-day waiting period for scheduling an election was eliminated. The December 22, 2011 rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for scheduling an election and made board review of post-election disputes mandatory in stipulated elections. In FY2010, NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them. 89.3% of elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between employers and unions. In FY2010, 89.3% of elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the two parties. Most elections are held within two months of filing a petition. In FY2012, 93.9% of initial representation elections were conducted within 56 days of filing a petition. Post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases in FY2011. The NLRB does not collect data on the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an NLRB election. The NLRA allows for voluntary recognition of a union through card check agreements, where a majority or supermajority of employees sign authorization cards. A neutral third party validates the signatures. Employees under voluntary recognition have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. However, within two years of winning an NLRB election, over two-fifths of cases did not reach a contract agreement, a higher percentage than previous studies. Under voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. A neutrality agreement may be combined with a card check arrangement, where the employer agrees to remain neutral during a union organizing campaign. This agreement allows for access to company property, employee information, and communication with employees. An agreement for a card check campaign, possibly with a neutrality agreement, may involve corporate campaigns such as consumer boycotts, rallies, and public relations efforts. Unions may also be recognized through a bargaining order issued by the NLRB if unfair labor practices prevent a fair election. The NLRB may issue a bargaining order if unfair labor practices hinder a fair election. Certification by the NLRB gives a union advantages, such as protection from decertification for a year. Voluntary recognition or a bargaining order do not result in certification. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 eliminated certification through methods other than NLRB elections. Under voluntary card check recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. Under NLRB rules, employees have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition if they want to be represented by a different union. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on whether a union has been certified by the board or recognized voluntarily. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain for a year. With voluntary card check recognition, bargaining must occur for a \"reasonable period of time.\" Employers can withdraw recognition under certain circumstances, such as if no contract agreement is reached after one year of good faith bargaining and there is doubt about employee support. In voluntary recognition, if no contract agreement is reached after a reasonable period, the employer may also withdraw recognition. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. An employer could withdraw recognition if no contract agreement was reached after a reasonable period of time and there was doubt about employee support. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required an employer to recognize the union if they did not have good faith doubt about employee support. The NLRB abandoned this doctrine in 1969. In 1969, the NLRB abandoned the \"Joy Silk doctrine\" which required employers to recognize a union if they did not have good faith doubt about employee support. The board ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. In recent years, the NLRB has considered cases involving voluntary recognition, including two cases in 2004 where unions were recognized under card check agreements. In December 2003, production and maintenance workers at St. Marys, Pennsylvania plant were recognized by the UAW. Dana Corporation also recognized the union at its Upper Sandusky, Ohio plant in December 2003 through a card check and neutrality agreement. Both cases involved card check and neutrality agreements before union recognition. Employees filed decertification petitions after recognition, but before a contract agreement, leading to NLRB dismissals based on the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. The NLRB granted a review of the dismissals for both Dana and Metaldyne Corporations. The NLRB granted a review of dismissals for Dana and Metaldyne employees represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation. Following voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification petition or representation election. If no petition is filed within 45 days, an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period. The board later reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases. The NLRB reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases, establishing a rule that after voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time, defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session. This decision followed a card check agreement between Lamons Gasket and the USW, where the USW was recognized as the sole representative of employees. The NLRB reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases, establishing a rule that after voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time, defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session. Following the decision in Lamons Gasket, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested information on cases affected by the Dana decision and Lamons Gasket, including those involving unfair labor practice charges and dismissed ballots. Union-employer collective bargaining agreements create a \"contract bar\" that prevents election petitions for up to three years. In August 2007, the NLRB allowed an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW in January 1999. After three years, employees requested a decertification election, but Shaw's withdrew recognition of the union instead. The NLRB ruled that neither the employer nor the incumbent union can initiate an election petition during the contract duration. The board voted 2-1 against the General Counsel's argument, allowing Shaw's to withdraw recognition. The NLRB ruled that an employer can withdraw recognition of a union during a contract term if there is evidence of loss of majority support. An impasse in collective bargaining may lead to a work stoppage, where workers may strike or be locked out by the employer. Mediation can be used to help reach a contract agreement in such situations. In mediation for collective bargaining impasses, a mediator assists the union and employer in reaching an agreement without imposing a settlement. Arbitration involves presenting positions to an arbitrator who decides on resolving issues, either in grievance or contract arbitration. Interest arbitration determines terms of initial or successor contracts, with various forms like voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between complete final offers from the employer and union. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union or between the final offers from each side on each issue. Voluntary arbitration involves agreement between the union and employer, while compulsory arbitration is required by law. Conventional arbitration allows the arbitrator to decide on a final contract agreement, while final-offer arbitration requires the arbitrator to choose either the union's or the employer's final offer. The arbitrator may choose the complete final offer (package) of either party or between final offers on each issue. Binding arbitration imposes the arbitrator's decision on both parties. In arbitration, parties can choose between binding and nonbinding decisions. Med-Arb combines mediation and arbitration, where a neutral party facilitates an agreement and decides on a settlement if needed. Interest arbitration is common in the public sector where strikes are limited. In the private sector, the right to strike can push parties to reach a contract agreement. In the private sector, the legal right of employees to strike and of employers to lock out employees can encourage contract agreements. Interest arbitration may deter strikes or lockouts but can also change negotiating behavior. When a bargaining impasse occurs, parties can resort to mediation, arbitration, strikes, or lockouts. Interest arbitration aims to avoid strikes or lockouts, which can impose costs on both workers and employers. However, interest arbitration may have a \"chilling\" effect on negotiations. Interest arbitration can have adverse effects on negotiations by creating a \"chilling\" effect and a \"narcotic\" effect. It may lead parties to take extreme positions and rely on arbitration rather than engaging in serious bargaining for future contracts. This can prevent the parties from making necessary compromises for a negotiated settlement. One proposal to address the chilling effect of conventional arbitration is final-offer arbitration. This approach limits the arbitrator to choosing the last offer from either the union or employer, encouraging both parties to make more acceptable offers. Final-offer arbitration could lead to increased willingness to compromise and potentially facilitate a contract settlement. The NLRA does not provide a statutory exemption for small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee. The NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee and does not assert jurisdiction over employers with annual revenues below certain standards. The board has jurisdiction over employers whose operations affect interstate commerce and has established administrative standards based on annual sales or gross revenue for asserting jurisdiction. Retail businesses must have annual sales of at least $500,000, hotels and motels must have at least $500,000 in gross revenues, and nonretail businesses must have either $50,000 in annual sales. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers with operations affecting interstate commerce, based on annual sales or gross revenue standards. Retail businesses need $500,000 in annual sales, hotels and motels need $500,000 in gross revenues, and nonretail businesses need $50,000 in annual sales. Private colleges and symphony orchestras must have $1 million in annual revenue. The board's ability to establish jurisdictional standards was codified by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The NLRB has jurisdiction over labor disputes based on standards set in 1959, where employers affecting interstate commerce must meet certain criteria. The board may decline jurisdiction if the dispute does not significantly impact interstate commerce, allowing other means for employees to unionize. State agencies or courts can assert jurisdiction over disputes where the NLRB declines involvement. In 2001, 5 million employees were affected by these jurisdictional standards. The Board declines jurisdiction over labor disputes based on 1959 standards. A report by the GAO estimated that 5 million employees of small employers lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. Recent legislation proposes changes to union certification procedures, including secret ballot elections or card check certification. These changes could impact unionization levels. The section discusses arguments for secret ballot elections and card check certification, which could impact unionization levels in the US. Supporters and opponents of card check certification use similar language to argue their positions. Employers fear coercion under card check, while unions argue against employer pressure during elections. Proponents of secret ballots emphasize privacy, while unions highlight employer access to employees. Unions claim card check is less costly, but employers argue unionization may be more costly for employees. Research suggests that card check certification may lead to higher union success rates compared to secret ballot elections. Unions are more likely to undertake unionization drives under card check certification, especially when combined with a neutrality agreement. Evidence from Canada shows that automatic card check recognition results in a higher union success rate. In Canada, provinces have laws governing union recognition. Five provinces currently require secret ballot elections, while others allow card check recognition. Under mandatory voting, a union needs a majority of votes in a secret ballot election to be recognized. Card check recognition automatically recognizes a union if a minimum threshold of employees sign authorization cards. A study found that union success rates are higher under card check recognition than secret ballots in Canada. The study analyzed union organizing campaigns in nine provinces in Canada between 1978 and 1996. In British Columbia, union recognition methods changed over the years, affecting union success rates. Mandatory voting in 1984 led to a decrease in success rates, while card check recognition in 1993 increased success rates. In Ontario, card check recognition before 1995 had higher certification rates compared to secret ballots after 1995, although union success rates decreased under secret balloting. The study compared union success rates under card checks and secret ballots. Success rates fell from 72.7% to 64.3% after the switch to secret balloting. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. Elections are held within five working days after an application under secret balloting. The study also found that each one percentage point increase in unionization raised the short-term unemployment rate by 0.30 to 0.35 percentage points in Canada. The study analyzed union success rates in Canadian provinces from 1976 to 1997, indicating higher success with card check recognition combined with a neutrality agreement. This approach may limit employer opposition and reduce costs, leading to a higher success rate for unions. Requiring card check certification along with a neutrality agreement may increase union success rates by reducing employer opposition. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization in the United States is uncertain. Americans generally support unions, with 59% approving and 31% disapproving according to a 2008 Gallup poll. Additionally, 53% of Americans favor a law that would make it easier for labor unions to organize according to a 2009 Gallup poll. According to polls from March 2009, 53% of Americans favor a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% oppose it. Another poll showed 33% agreed Congress should change laws to aid union formation, with 40% disagreeing. 61% believe a secret ballot is fair for union formation, while 32% think a majority signing cards should suffice. 57% find it difficult to form a union. According to surveys, 75% believe a secret ballot election is the most fair way to decide on union membership, while 12% prefer card check recognition. A 2005 survey found that 22% of workers felt pressure from management during a union organizing campaign, compared to 6% feeling pressure from the union. 5% of workers felt pressured to sign authorization cards in the presence of a union organizer. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. It aims to improve workers' bargaining power and intervention in labor markets can enhance competition. Competitive markets lead to efficient resource allocation and fair wages based on workers' contributions to output. In competitive labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output. Wages under perfect competition include compensation for unfavorable working conditions. The theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes individual preferences for different working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can raise wages, improve benefits, and working conditions. Unionization in monopsony markets can increase wages and employment. However, in competitive labor markets, increasing employee bargaining power may lead to a misallocation of resources and reduce economic output and consumer satisfaction. Higher union wages in competitive markets may lower employment for union workers. In competitive labor markets, higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers. Identifying the appropriate labor market and measuring competitiveness is challenging. Governments may intervene to reduce earnings inequality through unionization. Some argue that greater earnings equality during a recession can boost aggregate demand. Some economists argue that unionization can reduce earnings inequality and increase aggregate demand during a recession. Unions provide workers with a \"voice\" in the workplace, allowing them to communicate with management through dispute resolution or formal grievance procedures. Collective bargaining by unionized workers can lead to higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions. The economic impact of requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives and the competitiveness of labor markets. Requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections can impact unionization rates and economic efficiency, depending on the competitiveness of labor markets. Increasing workers' bargaining power may affect economic output and equality. The effects of these changes are difficult to predict or measure accurately. Requiring secret ballot elections or card check certification can impact unionization rates and economic efficiency. The effects on earnings inequality are uncertain and difficult to measure accurately."
