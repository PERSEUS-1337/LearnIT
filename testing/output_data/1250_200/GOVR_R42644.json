    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 million for DHS, excluding funds for overseas operations and disaster relief. The Senate-reported bill for DHS in FY2013 would have provided slightly less than the Administration's request, with adjustments to discretionary spending caps. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS. Increases were proposed for various DHS activities, including Border Security Fencing and Urban Search and Rescue Response programs. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as a continuing resolution on September 28, 2012. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, allowing the federal government to continue operations until March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. H.R. 933 was signed into law as P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013, providing $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security, with $38.348 billion available after across-the-board cuts. After sequestration, $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority was available for DHS from P.L. 113-6. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, and Appropriations bills. Post-sequester funding levels are from the DHS Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including OSEM, USM, CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and Secret Service. Amounts in the report are in budget authority and rounded to the nearest million. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security, which is organized into five titles for appropriations. These titles cover various agencies such as CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, Secret Service, NPPD, OHA, FEMA, USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. The structure of the appropriations bill may vary between House and Senate versions, with additional titles added as needed for special issues. The FY2013 appropriations bills had parallel structures with some differences in subcomponents and accounts noted. Congress determines budget authority through a two-stage process, with 302(a) allocations setting overall spending totals and 302(b) allocations allocating funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills. The 302(b) allocations for appropriations bills must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made by the Appropriations Committee during the year. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending, with all other spending capped. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of the total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for various purposes, and triggered automatic spending reductions when deficit reduction legislation was not enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions when deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by January 15, 2012. This process involved sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, with the Office of Management and Budget implementing across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made changes to the procedures, delaying the implementation of the joint committee sequester until March 1, 2013. The joint committee sequester was delayed until March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the dollar amount. Statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were lowered. President Obama ordered the sequester's implementation, with OMB reporting budget authority cancellations at the program level. Sequestration was applied to accounts with non-exempt funds, calculated on an annualized basis during a temporary continuing resolution. Post-sequestration numbers were based on the FY2013 DHS operating plan. Section 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to reduce budget authority to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS faces a 0.1% across-the-board cut in the \"security\" category. The Office of Management and Budget determines if spending limits are exceeded. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to avoid exceeding spending limits. OMB determined additional rescissions were needed for DHS. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are not subject to cuts. Tables in the report include CRS calculations of the effect of these cuts. Table 2 in the report displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, FY2012, and the President's FY2013 request. Three justifications from the BCA have influenced DHS's appropriations process, including emergency spending and overseas contingency operations. Adjustments for disaster relief are limited and determined by OMB using a specific formula. OMB determined the allowable adjustment for disaster relief to be $11,779 million for FY2013, fully exercised including $6,400 million in pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, which was rejected by the House, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding a civilian pay raise, reflected in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The breakdown of the DHS bill by component does not provide transparency into resource allocation. Table 4 and Figure 1 show DHS's budget authority for FY 2013, with adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations. General provisions in the bill include rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The bill's general provisions include rescissions of prior-year budget authority, reducing the net budget authority in the act. Figure 1 does not fully represent the resources available to individual DHS components, as much of DHS's budget is not from discretionary appropriations. Some components rely on fee income or offsetting collections for funding. Less than 4% of CIS's budget is from direct appropriations. Less than 4% of the budget for CIS is provided through direct appropriations, with the rest relying on fee income. Figure 2 shows the DHS budget not funded through discretionary appropriations, comparing the Administration's FY2013 budget request and enacted budget for FY2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up bills early in 2012, but P.L. 113-6 was the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for the department. Figure 3 shows the history of DHS appropriations bills moving through the legislative process. The DHS appropriations bills for FY2013 went through various stages in the legislative process. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, a 20.2% decrease from the requested level. The Senate-reported bill proposed $1,102 million, 13.8% below the request. After cuts, the final appropriations were $1,086 million, a 15.1% decrease. Sequestration further reduced funding to $1,026 million. The enacted amounts for Title I components for FY2012, FY2013 requests, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, and post-sequester levels were detailed by DHS. Departmental management accounts cover administrative expenses, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. Funding for headquarters consolidation is usually requested. A graphic representation of discretionary funding follows in each section. The discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS for FY2013 is detailed in a graphic, showing the relative size of each component compared to previous years. The total request for departmental management activities in Title I for FY2012 was $724 million, excluding $89 million for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with increases for OCFO and OCIO as well. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for three offices. Program changes included funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. $222 million was requested for the USM with several proposed program changes. The Administration requested funding for various offices within the OCHCO, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, including $26 million for salaries and expenses in the OCHCO, $55 million for the OCFO for financial systems modernization, and $313 million for the OCIO for infrastructure and security activities. This includes $122 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The total funding for management activities under Title I was $627 million, a decrease of $97 million from the President's request. The reductions were justified by the committee to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The total funding for management activities under Title I was $627 million, a decrease of $97 million from the President's request. During floor consideration of the bill, amendments were offered to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increase funds for various agencies, resulting in a total reduction of almost $33 million. During the House floor consideration of the bill, amendments were made to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and increase funds for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology by $10 million. Another amendment reduced funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increased funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. These changes left the USM with $41 million less than the requested level. Additionally, there were recommendations for official reception and representation expenses within OSEM, with an amendment reallocating funds to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding funds from various departments until required reports were submitted. This included withholding $71 million from obligation until all necessary reports were received for the FY2014 budget request. Additionally, a provision proposed barring the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft until key reports were submitted. Funding of $5 million for the Office of General Counsel was also proposed to be withheld until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation was published. Under the USM appropriation, over $124 million would have been withheld until all required reports were submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction in funding for OCPO due to failure to submit required reports on time. They also expressed the expectation for relevant components to report directly on their areas of responsibility. $242 million was allocated for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition. The House recommended a $242 million allocation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of information technology equipment. The Senate-reported bill proposed appropriations that were lower than the President's request, with a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I. The Senate-reported bill proposed a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I, representing a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The bill included a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. Additionally, funding for the DHS historian was discontinued, and reception and representation expenses were reduced by 15% for FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for reception and representation expenses in FY2012 and FY2013 due to budget constraints. The committee also proposed funding for oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures for DHS. The OCHCO was recommended $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in Salaries and Expenses. The OCIO was recommended $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for other expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $248 million appropriation for the OCIO, including $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments. This includes $57 million for IT equipment and $65 million for data center migration. The committee noted that data center consolidation could result in nearly $3 billion in savings by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with total funding for departmental management at $643 million, a decrease of $170 million from the President's request. The total funding for departmental management in Title I is $643 million, a decrease of $170 million from the President's request. Only OCIO faced a funding reduction due to sequestration. P.L. 113-6 directed the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded under the CIO. The Senate's explanatory statement directs various reports and plans to be submitted by DHS officials, including a report on travel costs, a contingency plan for user fee collections, a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report, and a report on workforce strategy implementation. The CFO is required to provide briefings on financial systems modernization efforts semiannually. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, reflecting spending cuts from FY2012 enacted amounts. The DHS Plan column shows budgetary resources after sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. Issues identified by the House and Senate Appropriations committees include new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans and reports, and the Administration's proposal for separate line items under OSEM. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices - OIA, SLLE, and PSO, currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal was rejected due to lack of Senate-confirmed heads and inconsistency with streamlining goals. The House committee directed the Department to consider establishing an external affairs office for coordination. The House committee report directs the Department to consider establishing an external affairs office to consolidate and streamline various functions currently spread across different offices within DHS. The Senate committee questions the need for standalone entities and suggests that these functions could be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. Additionally, the Administration's budget proposals to increase resources for the Department were rejected by the House but included by the Senate. The House committee report criticizes the President's budget for relying on unrealistic revenue assumptions and rejects budgetary tricks. They warn of necessary reductions in Department requests if such proposals are enacted into law. The Committee emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in budgeting. The House committee report criticized the Department for late submissions of required plans and reports to Congress, leading to a withholding of funding. The Committee stressed the importance of investment and expenditure plans for oversight and fiscal responsibility within the Department. The Committee criticized the Department for late submissions of required plans and reports, leading to a withholding of funding. The Department is expected to comply with statutory requirements for timely submission of expenditure plans. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all required reports are submitted on time. The House provision reduced the USM budget significantly, with 70% potentially withheld if provisions became law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of OSEM, USM, and CFO budgets until all required reports are submitted. The House committee report emphasized the need for better oversight of expenditures, requiring the Office of Inspector General to assess compliance with federal laws on travel and conferences. New provisions on conference spending were included in both House and Senate bills. Both House and Senate bills included provisions for better oversight of conference spending, requiring quarterly reports to the DHS OIG for events costing over $20,000. The Senate also restricted the use of grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and enforced compliance with OMB Memorandum M-12-12. Section 3003 of P.L. 113-6 mandated government-wide reporting on conference costs and limited the number of employees allowed to attend overseas conferences. The House and Senate bills aimed to limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences for DHS. The House proposed a cap of 50 employees unless it was a law enforcement conference, while the Senate suggested capping attendance at 50 employees per DHS component unless it was deemed important for national interest. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is spread across 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. The Department of Homeland Security approved a $3.4 billion master plan with the General Services Administration to create a new headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, aiming to unify functions and reduce inefficiencies. $1.4 billion is funded through DHS, and $2 billion through GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far, with Phase 1A nearing completion for a new Coast Guard headquarters facility. Some DHS functions in the DC area will not move to the new facility, with efforts to consolidate offices for cost savings on lease expenses. The Administration requested $89 million for the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including funding for a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. $24.5 million was also requested for moving the Coast Guard to its new facility in FY2013. No other funding requests for the DHS consolidated headquarters project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts. The bill would have provided the Administration's requested funding for the Coast Guard to move to the new facility, with an additional $10 million provided through the Coast Guard's construction budget. The Committee recommended no new construction funding in the bill for new Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, with funding included as part of the Coast Guard appropriation to cover the costs associated with completing the move of the Coast Guard headquarters to St. Elizabeths. The Committee includes additional funding under Coast Guard construction to ensure completion of the current project, improve site access, and support analysis for follow-on work. The Department is exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. $10,000,000 is allocated for Phase 1 of construction to ensure Coast Guard can move in 2013 without obstacles. The minority views on the new DHS headquarters project highlight the lack of funding for site access and necessary improvements, leading to delays and increased costs. The bill only allocates funds for Coast Guard relocation in 2013, with no funding for Phase 2 construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for highway interchange, but it was funded differently. Amendments addressing DHS headquarters consolidation were not considered on the House floor. The committee recommended full funding for the Coast Guard's move under Coast Guard operating expenses, with no funding provided for the project through the Coast Guard construction budget. An attempt to use $89 million for a highway interchange as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The committee allocated $89,000,000 for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management for headquarters consolidation and mission support consolidation, with requirements for expenditure plans and quarterly briefings on consolidation activities. The Department is developing an updated plan with the General Services Administration to complete headquarters consolidation in smaller segments. $29 million is allocated for necessary expenses for the project. Quarterly briefings are required on consolidation activities. The DHS operating plan includes funds for the department headquarters project and mission support consolidation, with $322 million allocated for the Analysis and Operations account supporting intelligence and operations coordination. OPS manages the National Operations Center for incident management and situational awareness. The FY2013 request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from the enacted FY2012 level. H.R. 5855 would have provided $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying certain proposed increases and decreases in funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the account, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, which is a decrease of $14 million from FY2012. They required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 and directed I&A to focus on functions providing unique expertise. P.L. 113-6 provides $322 million for the account, falling between the amounts in H.R. 5855 and S. 3216. The P.L. 113-6 figure for DHS's Analysis and Operations account is the same as the President's FY2013 request and 4.7% below FY2012. The operating plan for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced funding to $306 million. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and overlapping authorities. Representative Sue Myrick made these comments during a House Subcommittee hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The hearing focused on a report by the Aspen Institute regarding DHS's intelligence mission, emphasizing the need to avoid duplicating efforts of other agencies and instead focus on specific homeward-focused areas. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other federal agencies in I&A's mission. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds. The OIG conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department, reporting to Congress and the Secretary of DHS. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding for audits and investigations. The House-passed bill included $109 million for the OIG, with a $10 million reduction due to dissatisfaction with communication. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million, with $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE. The OIG's budget authority for FY2013 was $121 million, with a $4 million increase from the previous year and a $23 million decrease from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced the OIG's budget authority by roughly $7 million. The DHS OIG budget was reduced by $7 million due to sequestration, bringing it to $138 million in FY2013. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct various reviews and reports, including on CBP and ICE officers, DHS expenditures, non-competitive contracts, and local law enforcement operations. The House also directed the OIG to report on DHS compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards, conduct TSA screening inspections, and assess fraud detection reforms. The DHS OIG budget was reduced by $7 million in FY2013. The OIG was required to conduct various reviews and reports, including on CBP and ICE officers, DHS expenditures, non-competitive contracts, and local law enforcement operations. The House directed the OIG to report on DHS compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs, conduct TSA screening inspections, and assess fraud detection reforms. No additional funding was allocated for new tasks, except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers. The OIG's budget was reduced by $7 million in FY2013, leading to new tasks without additional funding. The Senate expressed concerns about the OIG's independence and timeliness in reporting results. GAO was directed to review the OIG's organizational structure and reporting functions. The OIG has many senior positions filled by acting officials, potentially hindering its duties. Title II of the DHS appropriations bill allocates funding for CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and the Secret Service. The Administration requested $30,759 million for various agencies including CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $30,946 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $30,974 million. After across-the-board cuts, the appropriations for these agencies totaled $31,267 million, but sequestration reduced it to $30,184 million. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry along the border, with a focus on preventing terrorism. They inspect people and goods to determine authorization for entry, enforcing over 400 laws to prevent illegal entries. CBP's major programs include Border Security Inspections, Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Facilities Management, and more. The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for security at ports of entry along the border, focusing on preventing terrorism and enforcing over 400 laws to prevent illegal entries. CBP's major programs include Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding numbers for CBP reflect spending cuts relative to FY2012 enacted amounts, with an increase in the Administration's requested budget authority for FY2013. The Administration's total budget request for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for FY2013 is $11,971 million, including program changes such as transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP, increasing funding for the Automated Targeting System, Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, and intellectual property rights enforcement. The budget for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for FY2013 includes increases for the Container Security Initiative and intellectual property rights enforcement, as well as expansions for CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. There are decreases in funding for Office of Air and Marine Interdictions, management and administration staffing, fleet acquisition and management, information technology infrastructure and support, and nonintrusive inspection. The House approved a net budget authority of $10,172 for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in various expenses such as information technology infrastructure, nonintrusive inspection operations, officer overtime, field support staff salaries, Air and Marine expenses, training expenses, and transportation program costs. This budget represents a $17 million increase from the previous year's appropriation and a $173 million decrease from the President's request. CBP would have received $11,689 in gross budget authority, a $37 million increase from last year and a $283 million decrease from the President's request. Amendments included adding funds for CBP salaries, communications infrastructure, and cutting environmental mitigation. The Senate proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million from last year and $109 million from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, a $319 million increase from last year and a $0.6 million decrease from the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with a $201 million increase from last year's appropriation. The Act includes $11,872 million in gross budget authority, a $98 million decrease from last year. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million. Various policy issues related to CBP were discussed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle. The US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, reimbursement authority, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security are key components of the entry-exit system that tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors to the United States. Biographic and biometric data are collected and stored in databases to help identify potential risks. The entry-exit system in the United States collects biometric data from non-citizens entering the country but not when they exit. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. Passenger manifest data is checked against various databases to identify overstays and potential risks. The U.S. entry-exit system checks data against various databases to identify overstays and high-priority individuals for follow-up investigations. Citizenship and Immigration Canada provides biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada for U.S. exit records. Congress has pushed for a comprehensive exit system, and the system's organizational structure has changed multiple times since its creation in 2003 as the US-VISIT Program under DHS. The US-VISIT Program, initially under DHS' BTS, underwent reorganization by former Secretary Chertoff, moving to a proposed Screening Coordination Office that was never funded. It became a stand-alone office in FY2006, transferred to NPPD in FY2008. In FY2013, a proposed move to CBP and ICE was not fully supported by Congress. The House-passed bill would transfer $73 million to CBP and ICE for entry-exit policy and overstay analysis, leaving $191 million for US-VISIT funding in a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Senate-reported bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation. P.L. 113-6 replaced US-VISIT with the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, with concerns raised about DHS staffing levels and infrastructure investments. The House report highlighted concerns about high staffing levels during budget tightening, suggested changes to reduce staffing requirements at ports of entry, and directed CBP to provide specific staffing plans. Additionally, it emphasized the need to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues to ensure adequate funds for CBP officer salaries. The House report emphasized the need to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues to ensure adequate funds for CBP officer salaries. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to illegal migrants and drug smugglers entering through POEs, while others support increased OFO staffing for enhanced security and facilitation of legal admissions. Sequestration in 2013 resulted in potential furloughs, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring for CBP personnel. The automatic spending cuts could lead to furloughs, reduced overtime, and hiring freezes for CBP personnel, affecting over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 CBP officers. DHS plans to minimize the impact by cutting employee awards, contracts, and administrative expenses. CBP may rely on overtime reductions and hiring freezes to avoid furloughs, but frontline staffing is likely to be affected. The administration is considering leveraging public-private partnerships to fund staffing and infrastructure at ports of entry, despite restrictions on fee-for-service basis for CBP. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and land ports of entry. CBP collects user fees, including COBRA fees, from passengers and cargo carriers for customs services. The COBRA fees, collected from passengers and cargo carriers for customs services, reimburse CBP for various functions. These fees are part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Some fees are mandatory spending, while others are discretionary appropriations. Congressional interest has been drawn to the collection of certain COBRA passenger fees without corresponding appropriations. Section 521 of the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and Section 601 of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 increased fees for passengers entering the US, resulting in significant revenue collection. The funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not been obligated for customs revenue collection yet. Congressional interest has been sparked by the collection of COBRA passenger fees without corresponding appropriations. The revenue raised from increased passenger fees under certain provisions is subject to limitations on its use, leading to questions from Congress. The House Appropriations Committee requested a report from CBP on accessing funds identified by GAO and addressing a budget shortfall. P.L. 113-6 allocated an additional $110 million to cover the shortfall in CBP salaries. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proposing a strategy to control the Southwest Border using technology for surveillance. Previous initiatives to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors have failed to deliver the desired level of surveillance. The Obama Administration cancelled the Secure Border Initiative (SBI net) in 2011 and replaced it with the Arizona Border Technology Plan. The Obama Administration cancelled the Secure Border Initiative (SBI net) in January 2011 due to practices, inadequate oversight of contractors, and cost overruns. It was replaced with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, which focuses on rapid deployment of existing technology for border surveillance. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan, citing delays in procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment. Despite recommending full funding for the border surveillance mission, both chambers suggested rescinding unobligated balances from the account. The House and Senate recommended rescinding unobligated balances from the border surveillance account, with differing amounts. The President's FY2013 budget supported manned and unmanned aircraft for surveillance activities. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems in various border regions, with increasing flight hours in recent years. Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance. The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for border surveillance in the Gulf of Mexico increased to 5,737 flight hours in FY2012 from 4,406 hours in FY2011. Some Members of Congress support UAS for border surveillance, but there are concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for inadequate planning and support resources. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for upgrading the OAM fleet and supporting UAS operations, with P.L. 113-6 appropriating about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations. P.L. 113-6 allocated $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with $284 million shifted to a new sub-account. CBP is directed to restore flight hours to 2011 levels and screen cargo for contraband. The SAFE Port Act requires maritime cargo scanning, and the 9/11 Act set a deadline for 100% cargo scanning by July 1, 2012, which was extended by Secretary Napolitano. In 2012, Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% cargo scanning deadline, raising concerns about balancing security benefits with costs. Suggestions were made to focus scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to reduce costs and streamline trade. The FY2013 budget included increases to programs like the Container Security Initiative and the Automated Targeting System for enhanced security screening. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees supported a $78 million increase for the Automated Targeting System and related programs for screening goods and travelers. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the U.S., including investigating violations and removing deportable aliens. They also combat terrorist financing and money laundering, enforce export laws, and address smuggling and fraud. ICE enforces immigration and customs laws, investigates violations, removes deportable aliens, combats terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforces export laws. The Administration requested $5,332 million in net budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The budget request for ICE in FY2013 included various changes such as increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program function. There were also reductions for programs like 287(g), Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided ICE with a total funding authority of $5,786 million, representing a decrease of $77 million from the FY2012 enacted level. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided ICE with total funding authority of $5,786 million, a decrease of $77 million from the FY2012 enacted level. Senate-Reported S. 3216 recommended ICE receive $5,330 million for FY2013, a decrease from the Administration's request and FY2012 enacted amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 allocates $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by an additional $200 million. Congress is debating how ICE resources should be allocated to best achieve its mission, including discussions on detaining and removing aliens and the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. ICE's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, with a capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year. There is ongoing debate on how ICE should prioritize the removal of removable aliens, with a focus on identifying and removing aliens convicted of a crime. Amendments have been made to direct the Agency's immigration enforcement priorities. The Department of Homeland Security prioritizes the removal of aliens convicted of crimes. ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations manage custody and ensure the departure of ordered aliens. Concerns exist about detention space shortages and inequities in release decisions. Some advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal aliens due to cost and fairness concerns. ICE's detention bed capacity has been a contentious issue, with 34,000 beds in FY2012. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a request to reduce to 32,800 beds in FY2013. In 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees citing budget constraints. Critics claimed the release was politically motivated. ICE Director John Morton stated that the release was necessary due to exceeding the funded bed capacity. P.L. 113-6 requires ICE to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013. Interest has been shown in developing alternatives to detention for certain aliens to reduce costs. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring for aliens with final removal orders. It includes electronic monitoring devices, home visits, work visits, and telephone reporting. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an increase in ATD program funding. The House passed a bill maintaining bed space and increasing ATD funding by $20 million, while the Senate proposed decreasing bed space by 600 beds and increasing ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD program funding by $19 million. The Administration requested $139 million for Secure Communities, a program for checking fingerprints of arrestees against DHS immigration records. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of jurisdictions and aims to expand nationwide by FY2013. House and Senate appropriators support the program's expansion. Enforcement of immigration laws by state and local agents through agreements like the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities is emphasized. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement officials in enforcing immigration laws through programs like \u00a7287(g) and Secure Communities has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, citing the efficiency of Secure Communities in identifying and removing priority aliens. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in favor of Secure Communities. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have allocated $51 million for 287(g) agreements. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about its operations and policies. However, some argue that the program is not productive and a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 to protect air, land, and rail transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. TSA's responsibilities include safeguarding the aviation system against terrorist threats and enforcing security regulations for all modes of transportation. The TSA budget is a complex component of transportation security. The TSA serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA budget is complex, with various sources of funding including airline security fees and other fees for transportation threat assessment. The President's request included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, representing a decrease from previous years. The President's request included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million for transportation security, with decreases in funding for aviation security and Surface Transportation Security. Planned reductions in procurement and program cuts were proposed to improve management efficiencies. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase under the request. The requested funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing (TTAC) would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million, including a one-time increase of $30 million for TTAC infrastructure modernization (TIM) and adjustments to the fee-based Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC). Funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%) from FY2012 levels, and funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) specified $930 million, a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). The House-passed bill included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million for TSA, representing a $147 million (1.9%) decrease from the administration's request. The House-passed bill for aviation security specified $5,041 million in gross budget authority, $57 million less than requested. However, with rejected proposed increases in passenger security fees, appropriations actually rose $58 million above the request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations. For surface transportation security, $126 million was specified, $2 million above the request but $8 million less than FY2012 enacted amount. Direct appropriations for TTAC were roughly in line with the request, while transportation security support and FAMS funding were below the request. The House-passed bill specified funding below the request for transportation security support and FAMS, citing budget shortfalls from proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with reductions from the Administration's request, including $5,087 million for aviation security. The Senate accepted proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in aviation security appropriations from the Administration's request. The House-passed bill specified funding below the request for transportation security support and FAMS, citing budget shortfalls from proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with reductions from the Administration's request, including $211 million cut for aviation security due to proposed passenger security fee increases. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $7,212 million for TSA, $629 million less than FY2012 levels. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, with a proposal to change to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission. Airlines have raised concerns about fee increases impacting passenger air travel. The Administration proposed doubling the passenger security fee to $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission, aiming to increase revenue collections by $317 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported this proposal, intending to allocate all fee collections to aviation security costs. The Senate committee approved applying all passenger security fees to aviation security as offsetting collections for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees despite identified savings of over $100 million from improved management efficiencies. Efficiency improvements at TSA have raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. TSA has initiated risk-based screening initiatives, including the PreCheck program, to focus resources based on security risk assessments. Various trial programs are underway to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings, with a focus on modified screening procedures for different passenger groups. TSA indicates that these initiatives will be identified in future budgets. The PreCheck program is a key part of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry. It is currently on trial for members of certain programs and frequent flyer members at select airports. Plans for further expansion in FY2013 have been made. Both the House and Senate committees support the expansion, with the Senate requesting reports on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. The Senate committee expressed concern about TSA's known crew member pilot program being limited to pilots and included bill language to expand it to include flight attendants. TSA's risk-based screening pilot programs have been viewed positively, but its behavioral-based observation and screening efforts face scrutiny. The House committee did not support increasing the number of Behavior Detection Officers, citing a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness. The committee called for a cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program and a robust risk-based strategy for their deployment. TSA is required to provide semiannual briefings on progress in developing trusted traveler approaches. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at FY2012 levels and passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million. This increase is offset by reductions in Screener Payroll, Compensation, and Benefits (PC&B) and Screening Technology Maintenance. The House also directed the TSA to revisit the use of FFDOs and other federal law enforcement assets on commercial aircraft to enhance security measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program, disagreeing with a request to reduce funding. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime homeland security, was transferred to the DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations. The Coast Guard was transferred to the DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations, with the House and Senate recommending more funding. P.L. 113-6 provided $10,400 million in total gross budget authority. P.L. 113-6 allocated $10,400 million in total gross budget authority to the USCG, with sequestration reducing it by $268 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected spending of $10,132 million, $200 million less than FY2012 levels. Differences in funding recommendations for vessel and aircraft acquisition were notable between the President's request, House, and Senate bills. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House funded four ($224 million) and the Senate funded six ($335 million). The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House funded four ($224 million) and the Senate funded six ($335 million). The House bill also included $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft, and the Senate requested $8 million for four more Response Boat Medium vessels. The DHS's sequestration operating plan allocated $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for one national security cutter and $319 million for six fast response cutters. The DHS's sequestration plan allocates $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for one national security cutter, $319 million for six fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. The House bill includes $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, with $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the new headquarters building. The House Appropriations Committee Report called for the Coast Guard to implement card readers for TWIC biometric security cards at ports and vessels. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions: criminal investigations including financial crimes and cyber attacks, and protection duties for the President, Vice President, their families, candidates, and designated individuals. They are also responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) like national conventions and international conferences. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) coordinates security arrangements involving various law enforcement units and receives a requested appropriation of $1,601 million for FY2013, which is $66 million less than FY2012. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million for FY2013, reflecting a decrease in funding due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season. The USSS budget for FY2013 was partially offset by restoring $8 million for support to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an $8 million increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million, reflecting a decrease of $54 million from FY2012 but $12 million above the Administration's request. Congress ultimately appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013. The Secret Service budget for FY2013 was reduced by $56 million compared to FY2012, with a total appropriation of $1.611 billion. After sequestration, the Service plans to spend $1.527 billion, primarily affecting its protection and investigation missions. Congress may need to address the balance between these missions and their impact on overall Secret Service operations. The Secret Service's protection mission employs most agents and receives more resources than its investigative mission. Congressional focus has been on protection and agent misconduct. The need for protection has increased due to potential threats. Advocates for expanding the investigation mission argue it enhances protection. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with a requested increase for FY2013. The Administration requested $5,911 million for various agencies including the Secret Service, Office of Homeland Security, and FEMA in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $5,930 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $5,971 million. Both versions included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. P.L. 113-6 provided $5,920 million after cuts and $6,400 million for disaster relief. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed by the Secretary for Homeland Security in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other Department locations, while the House suggested keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The House proposed creating an Office of Biometric Identify Management within the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities included $1,217 million, with $50 million for Management and Administration and $1,167 million for Infrastructure Protection and Information Security. This represented a decrease in overall funding compared to FY2012, except for a significant increase in the IPIS budget. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS was $1,167 million, a $278 million increase from FY2012. The increase was mainly for securing federal information systems, including a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS was $1,167 million, with increases for securing federal information systems, including initiatives for Federal Network Security and Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. Programmatic increases included funding for US-CERT and the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center, while reductions were seen in infrastructure protection and communications funding. The Administration made reductions in funding for Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities, attributing $16 million to NPPD's ability to obligated funds and $8 million to the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $5 million less than requested for Management and Administration due to various concerns raised by the Administration. The reduction in the IPIS request was mainly in the Security Compliance project, following an internal review revealing implementation issues. The House proposed reductions in various projects within the NPPD budget, including $29 million less for Security Compliance due to implementation issues, $17 million less for NCPS deployment, and $3 million less for Global Cybersecurity Management. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard and consider alternative security programs. Additionally, $7 million was cut from Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications, while full funding was provided for the Federal Network Security project. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and Security Compliance projects. They acknowledged the need for additional funds for implementing future plans. The Committee proposed $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project to support continuous monitoring capabilities and other security measures. The Committee recommended funding for various cybersecurity projects, including withholding $120 million until an expenditure plan is produced for the Federal Network Security project. They also allocated funds for the Global Cybersecurity Management project and the Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and Awareness project, emphasizing the importance of improving cybersecurity at all government levels. The Committee highlighted the first National Cyber Security Review by NPPD, expecting future reviews to be conducted. The Security Review conducted by NPPD assessed cybersecurity capabilities of various government levels and recommended annual reviews for progress tracking. Funding was allocated for emergency communication projects, including the Next Generation Telecommunications project. P.L. 113-6 provided $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS program, and Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million for FY2014. In FY2014, funding allocations included $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific items for IPIS mentioned in the explanatory statement were $13.5 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention, $20.6 million for vulnerability assessments, $16.9 million for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, and $202 million for the Federal Network Security program. Additional instructions related to CFATS were provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. The Appropriations Act directs GAO and the Coast Guard to assess DHS progress in developing the CFATS program. GAO will review CFAT inspections, inspector training, and compliance barriers. NPPD must provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs. Agencies must submit expenditure plans to improve cybersecurity, with quarterly reports to OMB. OMB will summarize these reports annually for Congress. Funding levels for FY2012 and FY2013 for each PPA within the IPIS program are outlined in Table 16. The \"DHS Plan\" column in the IPIS program outlines post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Congress is concerned about CFATS compliance issues and cybersecurity, with a focus on information sharing and protecting critical infrastructure assets. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Their operations focus on security measures to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) provides security assistance to federal agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service, and administers security services for approximately 13,000 contract security guards. FPS's budget is funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants, totaling $1,302 million in the President's FY2013 budget request. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget for FY2013 included $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. The Senate Appropriations Committee requested briefings on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. FPS budget levels were unaffected by sequestration due to fee collection from federal entities. Congress is concerned about FPS mission aspects and funding. Appropriators aim to enhance training for contract guards and potentially federalize them. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to improve federal building security and strengthen the Federal Protective Service (FPS). However, none of the proposed bills were enacted. In the 113th Congress, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 (H.R. 735) was introduced to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and pilot the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC). The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) manages various programs including BioWatch, NBIC, and occupational health and safety programs. OHA also coordinates DHS programs with public health components and received $167 million in FY2012. The requested funding for FY2013 is $166 million to support 101 FTEs. The proposed allocation includes $125 million for BioWatch, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for Chemical Defense, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, mainly reducing funding for the BioWatch program. In FY2013, the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012 and $34 million less than the President's request. The decrease was mainly due to reduced funding for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million, slightly more than FY2012 and the President's request, with recommended amounts for BioWatch, Planning and Coordination, Salaries and Expenses, and the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, reflecting decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. In FY2013, the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received reduced funding of $132 million, mainly due to decreased funding for the BioWatch program. The House recommended reductions in total enacted budget authority for FY2013, reflecting across-the-board cuts under P.L. 113-6. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, directing the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to Congress. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) are responsible for monitoring various threats. The Committee directed a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, accounts for a significant portion of OHA's budget. The program aims to deploy more advanced sensors for improved detection capabilities. The BioWatch program, funded by OHA, aims to deploy more advanced sensors (Gen-3) to detect airborne pathogens faster. However, Gen-3 has faced technical and management challenges, with a high estimated cost of $5.8 billion. Congressional appropriators have limited funding for program expansion, hindering Gen-3 development. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards, leading and supporting preparedness for disasters. FEMA's mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards through a comprehensive emergency management system. It provides assistance to state and local governments for incident response, recovery, and mitigation. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, with an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, a decrease from the President's request. The Senate-reported S. 3216 suggested an increase in funding for FEMA. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $4,351 million for FEMA, including less funding than requested for the Disaster Relief Fund due to across-the-board cuts. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, a decrease from the President's request. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $4,351 million for FEMA, including less funding than requested for the Disaster Relief Fund due to across-the-board cuts. The bill includes $6,400 for the DRF for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act, paid for by the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions, plus $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA after sequestration. State and local governments have primary responsibility for most domestic public safety functions. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. President Obama issued a directive for a national preparedness goal to be developed in coordination with various levels of government, focusing on specific threats and vulnerabilities. The national preparedness goal defines core capabilities to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to the nation, superseding a previous directive after 9/11. The goal aims for a secure and resilient nation with capabilities to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. The national preparedness goal aims for a secure and resilient nation with capabilities to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. Several homeland security grant programs were added post-9/11 to ensure state and local preparedness. The federal government provides various grant programs for state and local government homeland security preparedness, including Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, and others. Despite this assistance, federal grants account for less than one percent of total state and local government public safety expenditures, which amount to $218 billion annually. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for FY2013, an increase of $400 million from the previous year. The requested funding for FY2013 includes support for a National Preparedness Grant Program, but the House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about consolidating state and local preparedness grants under this program due to lack of authorization, details, and stakeholder participation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and continuing the grant structure enacted in FY2012. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs. $55 million was provided to Operation Stonegarden, and $150 million for other programs. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, with allocations for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with funding for various security grant programs and education/training/exercises. After cuts and sequestration, P.L. 113-6 provided $1,467 million for state and local programs, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from FY2012. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs, with a decrease in budget authority due to sequestration. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs, resulting in $132 million higher funding available for grants compared to FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants, including allocations for AFG and SAFER. The FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER. The Administration suggested categorizing these grants under First Responder Assistance Programs (FRAP) within FEMA's State and Local Programs (SLP) appropriation. Grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. The House-passed bill would have funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The House-passed bill denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. It designated up to 4.7% of the appropriated amount for firefighter assistance program administration. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million for AFG and $337.5 million for SAFER. The Senate Committee also denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account, included SAFER waiver authority language, and expected DHS to consider economic hardship when granting waivers. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funded firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded annually through regular appropriations but often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to ongoing recovery efforts from major disasters. The reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, with the Administration requesting $6,088 million for FY2013. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million from the previous year. The request included $608 million for non-disaster related activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs. This increase in funding was due to the impact of the Budget Control Act allowing for adjustments to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was three times larger than the FY2012 request. The Administration proposed funding based on past catastrophic events, non-catastrophic events, and a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's funding request for the DRF. Additionally, $24 million was transferred from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 allocated $7,007 million to the DRF, with $24 million earmarked for audits on public assistance projects and FEMA's debris removal decisions. The FY2013 budget allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $24 million designated for audits on public assistance projects and FEMA's debris removal decisions. The Budget Control Act (BCA) includes provisions for disaster relief funding adjustments to prevent sequestration due to exceeding discretionary spending caps. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) receives funding for activities related to major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act, not solely from FEMA but also from various federal accounts. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion, including supplemental assistance from FY2012 and adjustments for FY2013. Additional resources of $11.485 billion were approved by Congress through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received additional resources through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, exceeding the allowable adjustment for disaster relief in FY 2013. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, stating it duplicated the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program is being phased out as it duplicates the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). PDM awards grants prior to disaster events and applies to all hazards, unlike NFIP programs which only address flood hazards. There is concern over the slow pace of awards and large unobligated balances, with proposed appropriations of $14.3 million by the House and $35 million by the Senate. Funding rescissions from unobligated balances are also being considered. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program is facing challenges in funding administration due to reduced post-sequester amount of just under $25 million for FY2013. The program may have to work from existing, unfunded applications to continue funding cycles. The Administration has consistently proposed reduced funding for the program, with FY2013 requesting $100 million, a $20 million reduction from FY2012. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, and for FY2013, the House has maintained the funding level at $120 million while the Senate has suggested an increase. Congress funded the program at $120 million, $20 million over the requested level. For FY2013, the House has maintained the funding level at $120 million while the Senate has suggested raising it to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 for the program is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arise over delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill contains appropriations for various agencies, with the Administration requesting $1,561 million for FY2013, a decrease of $229 million from the enacted level. The House-passed bill provides $1,510 million, a 3.3% decrease from the requested level. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill contains appropriations for various agencies, with the Administration requesting $1,561 million for FY2013. The House-passed bill provides $1,510 million, a decrease of 3.3% from the requested level, while the Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million after across-the-board cuts, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level. USCIS's major activities include adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum considerations. The USCIS budget includes appropriations for processing petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee/asylum claims, and humanitarian concerns. The agency funds its operations through revenues generated by the Examinations Fee Account, with most revenue coming from adjudication fees. Annual direct appropriations have been used for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-verify program. The USCIS budget for FY2013 includes $3,005 million in gross budget authority, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. This includes funding for the E-Verify program, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and SAVE Program. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a budget of $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. H.R. 5855 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for a pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. Funding for military naturalizations was not provided, with the suggestion that it should be funded by the Department of Defense. The House Committee expressed concerns about a 2012 OIG report on USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection. They directed USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to assess USCIS actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, allocating $20 million from user fee revenues instead. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for E-Verify and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations and an additional $5 million via fees. They expressed concern about the costs of administering the grant program and directed that no more than 5% of the funding be used for administration. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $114 million for DHS, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce the enacted level of funding for USCIS to $109 million. Potential issues for Congress included fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. USCIS relies on fee revenue to support its operations and must carefully monitor fee collections to prevent backlogs or over-budgeting. The House Committee directed USCIS to consider operational costs, such as asylum processing, when assessing the need for fee adjustments. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a topic of debate in Congress, with the Administration requesting appropriations while the House and Senate Committees prefer funding from fee revenue. P.L. 113-6 mandates USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account for immigrant integration grants in FY2013, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of certain services for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification of continued investment in the current contract. Concerns were raised about the operability of the E-Verify program, leading to the extension of its authorization for one year. USCIS was directed to create a review process for E-Verify final non-confirmations. The House Committee directed USCIS to create a review process for E-Verify final non-confirmations and report on the cost of expanding E-Verify. They also discussed challenges in agriculture hiring and supported efforts to increase efficiency and digitize immigration records. The House Committee directed USCIS to create a review process for E-Verify final non-confirmations and report on the cost of expanding E-Verify. They also discussed challenges in agriculture hiring and supported efforts to increase efficiency and digitize immigration records. Additionally, the Committee urged DHS to work with other relevant Federal agencies to review refugee processing and streamline procedures while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use its parole authority to address urgent humanitarian needs, especially in cases of family unity and medical emergencies after natural disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides basic and advanced law enforcement instruction to various federal, state, and local entities, promoting consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training at four sites in the US, employs around 1,100 personnel, and had a proposed budget of $258 million, a decrease from the previous year. The FLETC budget includes two appropriations - Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million. Reductions were made in both appropriations, mainly due to efficiencies and deferring construction work. The House-passed bill proposed $256 million for FLETC, slightly below last year's level. The Senate-reported bill included $258 million for FLETC. The FLETC budget includes two appropriations - Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million. Reductions were made in both appropriations due to efficiencies and deferring construction work. The Senate-reported bill included $258 million for FLETC, which is the same level as requested by the President. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce funding to $245 million, potentially impacting R&D activities. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The request for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a significant increase of $212 million (79.9%), with the largest increase in funding for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction of $50 million in the request for Laboratory Facilities, partly due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). DHS had plans to assess the need for a facility like NBAF at the time of the FY2013 request. The FY2013 request for the S&T Directorate included plans for an assessment of NBAF construction. The House-passed bill provided $826 million for S&T, $6 million less than the request. The bill allocated $72 million less for RDI but $75 million more for Laboratory Facilities, specifically for NBAF construction. The Senate recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request, with separate amounts for each RDI thrust area and no funding for NBAF construction due to a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $834 million for S&T. The committee noted a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion for the facility. P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate, with $28 million less than the request for RDI. The act also directs DHS to submit a breakout of RDI funding by thrust area. For Laboratory Facilities, $37 million more than the request is allocated for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. See Table 22 for a breakdown of DNDO funding. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% above the FY2012 appropriation of $290 million. The request included an increase of $44 million (109.7%) for Transformational R&D. The House-passed bill would have provided $316 million for DNDO, or $12 million (3.6%) less than the request, with most of the reduction in the Transformational R&D program. The House-passed bill directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The House Appropriations Committee advocated consolidation of DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The committee directed DHS to develop a plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the same funding levels for DNDO as the Administration's request and also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The Senate Appropriations Committee's report on the updated implementation plan for DNDO under the global nuclear detection architecture did not include the House's annual requirement language. The report also mentioned the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA, with a post-sequester total appropriation of $303 million for DNDO. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined for existing program functions. The DHS Plan column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include rescissions of funding from previous years and appropriations for special initiatives. The Administration generally requests rescissions in specific accounts rather than through general provisions. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill, including rescissions and one-time provisions. They also suggested adding five new general provisions, such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes provisions for FEMA to use earmarked grant funds, establish an outreach program for dam safety, and allow CBP to enter into fee agreements. The bill also includes rescissions to reduce the net scoring. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but added 13 new ones during floor action. The House added 13 general provisions to the bill, including restrictions on funds for racial profiling, ICE rule enforcement, Public Advocate position in ICE, alternative transportation fuels, CBP funds use in Puerto Rico. The House added provisions to the bill, including restrictions on funds for racial profiling, ICE rule enforcement, Public Advocate position in ICE, alternative transportation fuels, and CBP funds use in Puerto Rico. These provisions prohibit certain actions such as sending or receiving information on immigration status, buying armed unmanned aerial vehicles, and enforcing an executive order for language access without burdening agency missions. The Senate bill includes provisions to implement language access for individuals with limited English proficiency, enforce ICE policy memos, and terminate local officials acting as immigration officers. The bill also includes rescissions and changes in fee programs to offset costs. The Senate bill includes provisions for language access, ICE policy enforcement, and ending local officials acting as immigration officers. Funding for DHS initiatives in FY2013 was modified, with $307 million in rescissions and general provisions offsetting costs by $202 million. Several provisions sought by the Administration were dropped in the enacted bill. The Senate bill included funding for DHS initiatives in FY2013, with provisions for immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and outlays. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from overspending. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority enacted by Congress, which may be indefinite. Budget authority can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with obligations incurred when agencies employ personnel, enter contracts, or receive services. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, and may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory spending provided in budget authority and resulting outlays. The federal government's budget authority includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government as part of business-type transactions and are not counted as revenue. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, there are offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress. This funding is used to calculate the gross budget authority. Since 9/11, there has been a growing interest in federal homeland security funding. The Office of Management and Budget reports to Congress on combating terrorism, with homeland security funding analysis becoming more detailed over the years. It's important to note that DHS funding does not cover all federal spending on homeland security, with DHS accounting for about 52% of total federal spending in FY2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accounted for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security in FY2012, with the Department of Defense following at nearly 26%. The top five agencies in spending on homeland security collectively made up approximately 93% of all federal spending in this area. It's important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, as legacy agencies within DHS also conduct other activities. The total budget authority for DHS in FY2012 was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion specifically allocated for homeland security activities. The budget authority for DHS in FY2012 was $52.5 billion. The inconsistency between homeland security budget authority and total budget authority is also seen in other agencies listed in the table. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available due to the impact of sequestration and P.L. 113-6."
