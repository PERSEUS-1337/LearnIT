    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for such activities. Candidate and party committees are limited to using regulated federal funds, also known as \"hard money,\" for \"federal election activity\" under FECA. In 2002, the FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, but this decision was challenged in court by Representatives Shays and Meehan. The court ruled in Shays v. FEC in 2004 that the FEC's regulations on political communications on the Internet were invalid, as they could potentially circumvent federal campaign finance laws. The Shays court overturned FEC regulations on political communications on the Internet, stating that excluding all Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with the BCRA. The court upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication\" but found that the FEC's 2002 NPRM did not provide adequate notice to the public. The court left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" online. The FEC's 2002 NPRM did not give adequate notice to the public regarding the establishment of a definition, leading to the Shays court overturning FEC regulations on Internet communications. The court found that excluding Internet communications from coordinated communications was contrary to Congress's intent in enacting the statute. The case was remanded to the FEC for further action. The FEC published an NPRM in response to the court's decision in Shays v. FEC, seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements. The proposed rules aimed to ensure proper financing and disclosure of Internet communications by political committees while allowing individual citizens to freely discuss candidates and elections online. The FEC approved new regulations in March 2006, aiming to regulate paid Internet advertisements by political committees while allowing individual citizens to freely discuss candidates and elections online. The regulations were influenced by the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision and aimed to prevent corruption while promoting free speech on the Internet. The FEC approved regulations in March 2006 to regulate paid Internet advertisements by political committees, aiming to prevent corruption while promoting free speech online. The regulations treat paid Internet advertising on another person's website as a \"public communication\" subject to FEC limitations and reporting requirements. The definition of \"public communication\" includes paid Internet ads placed on another individual or entity's website as a form of \"general public political advertising,\" subject to FECA contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimers are required on all political committee websites for paid Internet ads advocating for or against federal candidates. Payments to bloggers from candidates must be disclosed on candidate disclosure statements. Payments to bloggers from candidates are required to be disclosed on candidate disclosure statements. Coordinated internet advertisements placed on another website for a fee and coordinated with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations. The media exemption applies to news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed online. Individual or volunteer activity on the internet to influence a federal election is exempt from certain contribution and expenditure regulations. During Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002, communications over the Internet were not addressed. An amendment to exempt Internet communications from regulation under FECA was defeated. Several bills in the 109th Congress proposed to exempt all Internet communications from regulation under FECA, but they did not pass. During the 109th Congress, a bill failed to pass with a 225-182 vote, and two additional bills were proposed to address concerns about the Online Freedom of Speech Act potentially allowing FECA circumvention. However, House floor action was postponed indefinitely after new FEC regulations were approved in March 2006. In the 110th Congress, there was no major legislative action on the regulation of political communications on the Internet. During the 110th Congress, there was no major legislative action on the regulation of political communications on the Internet. H.R. 894 and H.R. 5699 were proposed bills related to extending disclaimer requirements to Internet communications and exempting certain Internet services from being treated as contributions or expenditures. Legislation regarding political communications on the Internet was proposed during the 110th Congress, including bills related to disclaimer requirements and exemptions for certain Internet services. A bill was introduced to include such communications in the general media exemption for broadcast stations and newspapers, but similar legislation has not been introduced in the 111th Congress."
