    "content": "The Construction Subcontractors Payment Protection Enhancement Act of 1998 establishes government-wide policies to ensure timely payment of contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers in federal procurement. This includes implementing statutes like the Prompt Payment Act, the Miller Act, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 through the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Construction Subcontractors Payment Protection Enhancement Act of 1998 establishes government-wide policies for timely payment in federal procurement. Proposed regulations for amendments made by the Act must be published within 120 days, with a 60-day public comment period. Final regulations will be published within 180 days and effective 30 days after publication. Additionally, related amendments to the Miller Act will be made. The Miller Act is amended to improve payment bond protection by equalizing the amount of the payment bond to the performance bond. It also extends payment bond protection to all subcontractors and suppliers by specifying conditions for progress payments and materials supplied. The Miller Act is amended to enhance payment bond protection by requiring written waivers for any protection afforded by a payment bond. Additionally, service of payment bond claims is modernized by specifying conditions for notice requirements. The Miller Act is amended to improve payment bond protection by updating notice requirements and discouraging frivolous litigation. The amendment allows for notice to be sent through various delivery services and electronic means, and prevents dismissal of suits filed within ninety days of the last labor or material provided if a written denial of payment is received from the contractor. The Miller Act is amended to improve payment bond protection by updating notice requirements and discouraging frivolous litigation. A court may award court costs, attorneys' fees, and interest to the prevailing party in a suit if the suit is deemed frivolous or groundless, or to preserve protections for small claims. Interest awarded will be calculated from the date of the claim to the date of payment using applicable interest rates. The Miller Act is amended to hold contracting officers accountable for obtaining and maintaining payment bonds for contracts. If a court finds that a required payment bond is not in effect due to the officer's negligence, the court may authorize a suit against the United States for the owed amount."
