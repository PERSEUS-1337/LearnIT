    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall, Old City Hall, and Independence Hall, need preservation due to financial constraints and the growing responsibilities of the National Park Service. The Federal Government has taken on the responsibility to maintain these sites for future generations. In 1994, the National Park Service will mark the anniversary of caring for Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The Congress acknowledges the need for preservation of historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall, Old City Hall, and Independence Hall. The minting of a United States coin to commemorate the ongoing maintenance of these shrines is deemed appropriate. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue $1 coins with specific specifications and designs emblematic of liberty. These coins will contain 90% silver and 10% copper, depict the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, and bear inscriptions of various patriotic phrases. The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The Secretary will obtain silver for the authorized coins from stockpiles. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.\n\nThe coins authorized under section 3 will be sold by the Secretary at face value plus costs and a $7 surcharge. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted. \n\nSEC. 7. ISSUANCE OF COINS. SEC. 7. ISSUANCE OF COINS.\n\nCoins authorized under section 3 may be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, starting on July 4, 1994, for a period of up to 1 year. Only one facility of the United States Mint can strike a particular quality. SEC. 9. DISTRIBUTION OF SURCHARGES.\n\n50% of surcharges from coin sales go to reduce national debt, while the other 50% is given to the Independence Hall Preservation Fund for capital improvements and projects in Independence National Historic Park. The Comptroller General can audit the Independence Hall Preservation Fund's expenditure of amounts paid under section 9. The Secretary must ensure no net cost to the government for minting and issuing coins, requiring full payment, security, or a guarantee for each coin issued."
