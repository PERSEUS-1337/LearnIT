    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. The metric was compared with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study introduces NetScore, a metric to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage, comparing it with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across various networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The research highlights the challenges in designing deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity effectively. The study introduces NetScore, a new metric designed to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network efficiency in deep neural networks. This metric aims to improve network model search and design by considering architectural and computational complexity. The research emphasizes the need for universal performance metrics that account for accuracy and complexity to guide practitioners in the field. The study introduces NetScore, a new metric to assess deep neural networks' balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and efficiency. Results can guide practitioners with a set of deep convolutional neural networks, including AlexNet BID22."
