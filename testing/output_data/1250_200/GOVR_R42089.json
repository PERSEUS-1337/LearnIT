    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still determining the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years on a per capita and aggregate basis. Residential energy use per capita has remained constant since the 1970s, with a downward trend starting in the mid- to late-2000s. Despite energy-efficiency gains, experts believe there is still potential for increased efficiency in the residential sector. Debate exists on the optimal level of investment in energy efficiency, which could lead to reduced energy use per capita over time. Population growth may still result in total residential energy use increases. This report explores promoting residential energy efficiency through tax incentives. This report explores promoting residential energy efficiency through tax credits, providing an economic rationale for incentives to correct market failures and barriers. Taxpayers can claim credits for residential energy-efficiency and renewable-energy technologies in the 2017 tax year. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements and high-efficiency appliances in their primary residence. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of energy-efficient property, capped at $500. The credit expired at the end of 2017. The Section 25C tax credit expired at the end of 2017, and taxpayers cannot claim it if they claimed $500 or more before 2017. The Section 25D credit allows for a 30% tax credit on renewable energy property installations in 2017, with rates decreasing in subsequent years and expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the Section 25D credit is not capped. For more details, refer to Appendices A and B. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments, known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency. Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, can explain suboptimal investments in residential energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities, like negative environmental impacts, may lead to underallocation of resources in this sector. Residential electricity consumption may have negative environmental externalities, such as pollution costs, not reflected in market prices. Lower prices lead to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Markets fail to consider these benefits, resulting in suboptimal adoption of technology. Market failures, such as knowledge spillover effects and the principal-agent problem, can lead to suboptimal adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Landlords and builders may underinvest in energy efficiency due to disconnects between decision-makers and end users, while capital market imperfections can also hinder investments in energy-efficient property. Initial high costs and lack of knowledge about end user energy use patterns contribute to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Market imperfections, high initial costs, lack of information, and credit constraints can lead households to underinvest in energy-efficient property. Low-income households are more likely to settle for less efficient alternatives when unable to borrow funds upfront. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies can also deter consumers from making investments. Government policies like tax incentives can help address market failures and barriers. Government policies, such as tax incentives and regulations, can help address market failures and barriers to energy efficiency investments. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, while programs like Energy Star labeling can support investments in energy efficiency. Other tax incentives, like the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit, can reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax credits and incentives can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments and products. However, if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to low electricity prices, tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option. It may be more effective to allow electricity prices to fully reflect costs by removing federal financial support for electricity or taxing electricity production that generates external costs. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs can encourage investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords investing in rental properties. Other tax incentives, like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, directly tackle market imperfections. Tax credits, claimed months after purchases, may have limited impact on overcoming capital market imperfections. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address market failures for homeowners unable to secure credit for upfront costs. While they reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits can benefit consumers lacking information on energy-efficient technologies, but may decrease total welfare for well-informed consumers. In such cases, tax credits may not be necessary and could result in windfall gains. According to research, tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address market failures for homeowners unable to secure credit for upfront costs. They may provide windfall gains to recipients and be most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. The effectiveness of tax incentives in promoting additional investment in energy-efficient property is unclear, as they may only reward consumers who would have made investments regardless. Residential energy tax credits aim to encourage energy-efficient investments, but their effectiveness in driving additional investment is uncertain. These credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and may not effectively address market failures for homeowners lacking upfront costs. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has identified administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments or reduced energy consumption. Concerns about the effectiveness of these credits were raised in the 1970s, with some Members of Congress questioning their impact. Representative Bill Frenzel noted that the tax credits did not provide a significant incentive for investment and were more of a reward for actions already taken. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively stimulate additional investments. Empirical evidence on the impact of tax credits in the late 1970s and early 1980s is mixed, with some researchers suggesting that the credits may have led to windfall gains rather than increased energy-efficiency investments. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits can truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Consumers may be influenced by other market incentives when making decisions on energy-efficiency improvements. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively stimulate additional investments. Savings from tax credits are delayed until tax returns are filed, reducing their incentive power. Tax credits only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding those without federal income tax liability. These incentives are most likely to motivate energy-efficiency investments for certain types of taxpayers. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency target higher-income taxpayers with tax liability to motivate investments in energy-efficient equipment like heating and cooling property. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties, focusing on homeowners as the target population for tax credits. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency target higher-income homeowners, who tend to claim the majority of energy tax credits. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by taxpayers with incomes above $50,000, accounting for 89.0% of the total value of credits. Even though lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of tax units, only a quarter of them claim residential energy tax credits, receiving 11.0% of the total value. As income levels increase, the average amount of residential credits also rises, with the highest-income taxpayers receiving the largest credits. Tax units with higher incomes receive significantly larger residential energy tax credits, with the highest-income taxpayers receiving credits approximately seven times larger than the lowest-income tax units. The nonrefundability feature of certain tax credits limits who can claim them, as the value cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. Taxpayers without enough tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from certain tax credits, such as the Section 25C credit. This limitation may undermine the policy rationale of using tax credits to incentivize energy-efficiency investments. Energy-efficiency tax incentives are often limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may undermine the policy goal of motivating energy-efficiency investments. Tax credits that reduce upfront costs could encourage more investment, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not effectively address market barriers. A simple tax code with low compliance costs can increase taxpayer participation in claiming benefits. However, there may be a trade-off between easy access to tax credits and overall taxpayer compliance. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in residential energy tax credits due to lack of verification by the IRS. Taxpayers were not required to provide information or receipts to confirm eligibility for the credits. The IRS Form 5695 did not verify eligibility for residential energy tax credits, leading to potential fraud. TIGTA found that some taxpayers claiming the credits were not homeowners. The IRS incorrectly denied eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in credits. The $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in improper denials. The $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, causing affected taxpayers to be improperly denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to let these tax credits expire as scheduled, with potential policy options including modifying or replacing them with a grant program. Policymakers may choose to extend, expand, or modify these credits in the future. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency have undergone changes since 2005. Extending the credit with the $500 cap may not provide sufficient incentives for homeowners. Expanding the credits by removing caps and including more technologies could encourage more purchases. The value of these credits grew significantly between 2007 and 2009. The expansion of residential energy efficiency tax credits between 2007 and 2009 may provide windfalls to taxpayers. Policymakers could make changes by reinstating technology-specific caps, introducing an overall cap, or phasing out credits for upper-income taxpayers. These changes may increase confusion among taxpayers estimating their credits. Extending, expanding, or scaling back these credits will have a greater budgetary cost than letting them expire. Policymakers may consider replacing the tax credits with a rebate program or alternative mechanism. Policymakers may consider replacing residential energy efficiency tax credits with a rebate program to provide direct cash payments to consumers for eligible purchases. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program called Home Star, but it was not passed by the Senate. See Appendix C for more information on the budgetary effects of these provisions. The legislation called Home Star, passed by the House in 2010, was not considered by the Senate in the 111th Congress. Appendix A provides details on property eligibility for residential energy-efficiency tax credits. Appendix B outlines the legislative history of tax credits for residential energy efficiency, introduced in the late 1970s and reintroduced in 2005. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 first introduced tax credits for conservation and renewable-energy generation. In 1980, Congress passed the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223), which increased the federal tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. The legislation increased the second component of the credit for renewable energy generation to 40% of the first $10,000 in expenditures, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired at the end of 1985. It wasn't until 2005 that Congress enacted new temporary tax credits for homeowners making energy-efficiency improvements under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58). Under EPACT05, tax credits were available for energy-efficiency improvements to homes in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to claim a 10% credit on qualified expenditures, with specific limits for different types of property. The maximum credit for windows was $200, and the lifetime cap was $500. Another credit, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), provided a 30% credit for qualified photovoltaic properties. In 2007, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) offered a 30% nonrefundable credit for qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, with annual limits. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties was capped at $2,000 per year, while fuel cells were limited to $500 per year. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for 2008, allowing all solar energy properties to qualify for the credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year. It expanded the list of qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from Section 25C but added to Section 25D. The tax credit was extended through 2016, with modifications for existing and new technologies. The $2,000 annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures was eliminated in 2009. The credit was expanded to include small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to a cap of $500 for each half kilowatt of electric capacity generated by a wind turbine. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and properties. The credit for small wind-energy properties was 30% of expenditures up to $4,000 annually, while geothermal heat pumps had a $2,000 annual cap. The ARRA lifted the aggregate credit cap to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, eliminating the $200 cap for windows. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and properties. The $200 aggregate cap for windows was eliminated for 2009 and 2010, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows. Efficiency standards were reduced, expanding the availability of the credit to additional products. Changes to the Section 25D tax credit removed maximum credit caps for most technologies. These changes were effective from 2009 through 2016, leading to an increase in the number and amount of credits claimed. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, reinstating the general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit. Certain efficiency standards were restored to pre-ARRA levels, and technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property were reinstated. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the credit for 2015 and 2016, with stricter Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. The Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors will be more stringent starting in 2016. The 25D credit for solar technologies has been extended through 2021, with a modified credit formula. The 25D credit for nonsolar technologies is set to expire at the end of 2016. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, harmonizing the credit formula with solar technologies. Credit rates for nonsolar technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021."
