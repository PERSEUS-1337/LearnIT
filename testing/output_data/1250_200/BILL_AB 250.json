    "title": "AB 250",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward\" and \"synchronous interaction.\" This section outlines the roles of health care providers at distant sites and originating sites in providing medical services via telecommunications systems. Telehealth involves delivering healthcare services via technology for patient care management. Providers must inform and obtain consent from patients before using telehealth. Patients can still receive in-person care if they agree to telehealth services. The failure to comply with telehealth regulations is considered unprofessional conduct. Telehealth does not change the scope of practice for healthcare providers or allow services in unauthorized settings. Patient confidentiality laws apply to telehealth interactions. The rules do not apply to patients in correctional facilities. Hospitals can grant privileges for telehealth providers based on medical staff recommendations. The Legislature intends to authorize hospitals to grant privileges and verify credentials for telehealth providers. Telehealth includes telemedicine as defined in federal regulations. Applicants for licensure must complete 3,000 hours of experience over 104 weeks, with specific supervised hour requirements before and after obtaining a master's or doctoral degree. The applicant must not exceed 750 hours of counseling and direct supervisor contact before completing their master's or doctoral degree. Experience cannot be gained before completing 12 semester units or 18 quarter units of graduate instruction, except for personal psychotherapy. Additionally, no more than 1,000 hours of combined experience in direct supervisor contact and professional enrichment activities are allowed, with some exemptions for clinical experience gained in supervised practicum. Professional enrichment activities for marriage and family therapy applicants include workshops, seminars, and personal psychotherapy. Limits are set at 250 hours for workshops and 100 hours for personal psychotherapy. Additionally, no more than 500 hours of group therapy or counseling experience is allowed, along with restrictions on administering psychological tests and client-centered advocacy. Experience in administering psychological tests, writing clinical reports, and client-centered advocacy is required. Applicants need a minimum of 500 hours diagnosing and treating couples, families, and children, with specific credit for conjoint therapy. There is a limit of 375 hours for personal psychotherapy, crisis counseling, or counseling services via telehealth. Working with elders and dependent adults with limitations is encouraged. These requirements apply to hours gained after January 1, 2010. All applicants, trainees, and registrants must be supervised to ensure counseling aligns with their training. Supervised experience can only be gained as an employee or volunteer, not as an independent contractor. Interns must provide W-2 forms if employed, or a letter from their employer if volunteering, when applying for licensure. An intern must provide a letter from their employer verifying their volunteer status when applying for licensure. Supervision requirements include one hour of direct supervisor contact per week for every five hours of client contact, with additional contact for those with more than 10 hours of client contact. Face-to-face contact can be individual or in a group setting. The supervision requirements for interns include one hour of direct supervisor contact per week for every five hours of client contact, with additional contact for those with more than 10 hours of client contact. Direct supervisor contact can be provided in a group setting of up to eight supervisees for at least one continuous hour. Interns working in specific settings may use videoconferencing for supervisor contact. All experience gained by a trainee must be monitored by the supervisor. Six hours of supervision per week can be credited starting from January 1, 2009. A trainee or intern can gain supervised experience in a mental health counseling or psychotherapy setting that meets specific criteria. The setting must provide oversight to ensure the trainee's work aligns with requirements and is within the profession's scope of practice. Private practices owned by licensed professionals are excluded. Experience can be gained through volunteer or employment positions. An intern can gain supervised experience in a mental health counseling or psychotherapy setting that meets specific criteria. They should not work in a private practice until registered. Fair remuneration is encouraged for interns. Interns, whether paid or volunteering, should receive fair remuneration. In private practice, interns must be supervised by a licensee who meets specific requirements, except during supervisor's vacation or sick leave. Experience gained by interns should be related to their position. Registration as an intern with the board is necessary for postdegree supervised experience hours towards licensure, except under certain circumstances. All individuals must register as interns with the board to receive credit for postdegree supervised experience towards licensure, except in private practice where all experience hours count if the intern applies within 90 days of obtaining their qualifying degree. Interns, trainees, and applicants cannot receive payment from patients and can only be compensated by their employers. Trainees, interns, and applicants must only be paid by their employers and cannot receive remuneration from patients. They are required to perform services under the direction and control of their employer, including via telehealth, and must not have any proprietary interest in their employer's business. Trainees, interns, or applicants can be considered employees if they receive up to $500 per month for expenses incurred while providing services in a lawful work setting. The board may audit these individuals to ensure expenses were legitimately reimbursed. Each educational institution and supervisor should consider encouraging students, interns, and trainees to undergo counseling or psychotherapy as appropriate. They may also assist in locating affordable counseling services if desired by the applicant."
