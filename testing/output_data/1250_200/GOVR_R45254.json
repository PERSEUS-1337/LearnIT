It also includes provisions on Cuba sanctions and funding for the Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, judiciary, and District of Columbia. Financial regulatory agencies are funded separately from the FSGG appropriations bill. The FSGG appropriations bill focuses on funding financial services agencies, excluding financial regulatory agencies. The bill has been in its current form since 2007. Both the House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, except for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump's FY2018 budget request included approximately $3.1 billion for independent agencies funded through the FSGG bill, with $330 million allocated for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018, with $253 million for FSGG independent agencies and $248 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The FY2018 funding for the FSGG independent agencies in the reported bill was $253 million, with an additional $248 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The total funding of $501 million was significantly below the President's request, with most of the difference in funding for the General Services Administration. H.R. 3280 was included in H.R. 3354, which passed the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a total funding of $593 million for the FSGG independent agencies in FY2018, with significant differences from the President's request.

Appropriations for the CFTC fall under the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee in the House and the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate. Reforms were implemented after the 2008 financial crisis to address concerns over the largely unregulated swaps markets. The Dodd-Frank Act brought previously unregulated over-the-counter swaps markets under CFTC jurisdiction, along with futures and options markets.

The General Services Administration administers federal procurement policies and manages federal property and records.
