This amount was deemed necessary to fund mandatory expenses and allow the courts to operate at FY2003 staffing levels. Subsequently, an FY2004 budget for the Judiciary was signed into law by President Bush as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (P.L. 108-199), providing $5.17 billion in total budget authority for the Judiciary, a 5.0% increase over FY2003 funding.

The Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference formulated a plan based on a 4.7% increase in funding for the Salaries and Expenses account and a 5.0% increase for the federal Judiciary as a whole. The Judiciary noted that these increases were impacted by rescissions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, resulting in inadequate funding for court staffing and payments to panel attorneys representing indigent defendants. Chief Justice Rehnquist described the FY2004 budget process as difficult in his 2003 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary. In FY2004, Chief Justice Rehnquist expressed concerns about the Judiciary's budget process, citing disruptions due to delays in Congress passing appropriations.

Additionally, $10.4 million was requested for an increase in hourly pay rates for panel attorneys in non-capital cases from $90 to $113, also effective on April 1, 2004. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 did not provide for these increases, instead urging the Judiciary to address concerns before requesting pay raises above the rate of inflation. The House CJS bill included funding for inflationary increases in panel attorney pay rates, but the House Appropriations Committee rejected a pay raise request for non-capital panel attorneys. The committee questioned the Judiciary's proposal for a single hourly rate nationwide, citing disparities in costs to attract and retain counsel.
