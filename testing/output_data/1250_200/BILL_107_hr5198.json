    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Premier Certified Lenders Program Improvement Act of 2002\". The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has been successful in helping small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses. Requiring lenders to maintain unnecessarily large loss reserve accounts limits their ability to serve additional small businesses. Premier certified lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk associated with the PCLP loan portfolio. Changing the PCLP to require premier certified lenders to maintain loss reserve accounts reflecting the risk of loss associated with the loans will protect taxpayers and enhance the program's support for small businesses' economic development. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE LOSS RESERVE FOR CERTAIN PREMIER CERTIFIED LENDERS. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE LOSS RESERVE FOR CERTAIN PREMIER CERTIFIED LENDERS. Section 508(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended to allow qualified high loss reserve PCLs to elect alternative loss reserve requirements in place of existing ones. Contributions to the loss reserve are not required for PCLs making this election, based on the risk of loss. The election described in subparagraph (A) requires companies to contribute to their loss reserve before the end of each quarter to ensure it is at least $25,000 and sufficient to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss associated with their PCLP loans. Qualified high loss reserve PCL refers to premier certified lenders designated by the Administrator. Premier certified lenders must maintain a loss reserve of at least $25,000 and analyze the risk of loss for their PCLP loans. Qualified high loss reserve PCL companies need third-party auditors to certify the adequacy of their loss reserves quarterly. Premier certified lenders must maintain a sufficient loss reserve to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss associated with their PCLP loans. Other companies require third-party auditors to certify the adequacy of their loss reserves every 90 days. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended to specify different periods within a year, and a conforming amendment is made to Section 508(b)(2)(D) of the Act."
