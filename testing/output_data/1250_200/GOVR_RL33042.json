    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, leading to a significant reorganization of the executive branch. Similar to the Department of Defense (DOD), DHS underwent structural modifications through legislative compromises. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to reorganize functions and units within DHS, with oversight from Congress and department officials. Secretary Chertoff utilized this authority to implement his plans. Additionally, the President had temporary authority to prescribe reorganization plans for DHS within a 12-month period after the Homeland Security Act's effective date. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave the President temporary authority to reorganize DHS, leading to the creation of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS was initially organized with various directorates and program entities reporting directly to the Secretary. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created with multiple units reporting directly to the Secretary, including the United States Coast Guard and United States Secret Service. DHS had around 170,000 employees, with a significant field organization. Secretary Michael Chertoff initiated a review of the department's organization and operations, involving 18 action teams and over 250 staff members. Secretary Chertoff led a review of DHS operations with 18 action teams and over 250 staff members. The 2SR initiative resulted in a six-point agenda focusing on increasing preparedness for catastrophic events, strengthening border security, enhancing information sharing, improving DHS stewardship, and re-aligning the organization for better mission performance. Secretary Chertoff led a review of DHS operations resulting in a six-point agenda to improve mission performance. Specific policy initiatives will be launched in key areas, including organizational changes to enhance intelligence sharing, operational accountability, and preparedness integration. Secretary Chertoff proposed the creation of a central policy office led by an Under Secretary for Policy to strengthen the Department's ability to develop vital policies. This initiative integrates international affairs staff, strategic planning capability, policy development assets, a senior policy advisor for refugee asylum policies, and private sector liaison resources. The idea builds upon previous work and recommendations for a consolidated policy directorate within DHS. The recommendation for the creation of an Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA) within the Department of Homeland Security was supported by Senator Susan Collins and proposed in a December 13, 2004, Heritage Special Report. This office would oversee strategic policy development and program policy efforts critical to forming Departmental policies. The Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA) oversees critical functions for forming Departmental policies. The Policy Review Board evaluates and promotes policies, ensuring they align with strategic goals. House appropriators approved $8.7 million for OPPIA, while Senate appropriators recommended $7.25 million and expected it to assume functions of the Operational Integration Staff. The Senate later approved this funding for OPPIA. The Senate approved funding for OPPIA, but DHS and House appropriators did not expect it to take over the functions of the Operational Integration Staff. Secretary Chertoff notified Congress of reorganization plans within DHS, including the establishment of OPPIA under an Assistant Secretary. He requested legislation to elevate the Assistant Secretary to an Under Secretary to lead the Directorate for Policy, relocating various organizational units to the new centralized policy office. The Secretary of Homeland Security announced the relocation of various units to a new centralized policy office, including the Office of International Affairs, the Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office, and the Homeland Security Advisory Committee. A strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator will also be established. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer to ensure coordination and analysis of intelligence within the Department. When DHS was established in 2002, the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) was tasked with analyzing information to identify terrorist threats. However, this provision was undermined shortly after. President George W. Bush announced the development of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) in 2003. President George W. Bush announced the development of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) in 2003, instructing key leaders to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. TTIC had the potential to parallel or even surpass the role of the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) in analyzing terrorism threats. TTIC was responsible for terrorism analysis, excluding purely domestic terrorism, and provided daily analysis to senior policymakers. IAIP, on the other hand, matched threat assessments to national vulnerabilities and provided intelligence support to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 transferred TTIC to the newly created National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), designated as the primary organization for analyzing and integrating all intelligence related to terrorism and counterterrorism. NCTC is responsible for strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities and coordinating with other agencies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 led to the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the mission and functions of IAIP in light of these changes and submit a report on its future role in the intelligence community. Secretary Chertoff mentioned in a reorganization notification letter to Congress that the Department has over 10 different intelligence offices, including those in Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Secretary Chertoff informed Congress of the reorganization within the Department of Homeland Security, highlighting the consolidation of intelligence offices to enhance coordination and information sharing. The Information Analysis unit will become a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary, with a focus on coordinating activities and fusing information from all intelligence offices in DHS. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, leading the renamed Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) to provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to state and local partners. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer will provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to state and local partners, enhancing coordination and information sharing within the intelligence community. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer will play a key role in intelligence collection and coordination within the Department, with plans for DHS to have a presence at the NCTC facility. Secretary Chertoff outlined the operational components that will have a direct line to him, including TSA, CBP, USSS, USCIS, ICE, FEMA, and USCG. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to establish a new Director of Operations Coordination within DHS to improve coordination and execution of operations with federal partners. This new office will work closely with component leadership to translate intelligence and policy into joint, well-coordinated actions. Secretary Chertoff proposed creating a new office, the Director of Operations Coordination, within DHS to enhance coordination with federal partners, streamlining processes and eliminating inefficiencies. He also sought legislation to remove the position of Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, as part of a broader restructuring effort to consolidate preparedness responsibilities under a single directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness. FEMA would remain a direct report to the Secretary, focusing on response and recovery, while the new directorate would provide support and resources for training. The new Preparedness Directorate within DHS will focus on response and recovery, supporting FEMA with training resources. Secretary Chertoff plans to appoint a Chief Medical Officer and an Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security within the Directorate to enhance coordination efforts. The Secretary of DHS plans to reorganize the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response by separating preparedness resources from response and recovery functions. This will involve transferring certain FEMA programs to the new Directorate for Preparedness, without requiring congressional action. The new Preparedness Directorate will focus on response and recovery, supporting FEMA with training resources. The BioShield program will be transferred to the Preparedness Directorate, as part of the reorganization plan by the Secretary of DHS. The new Preparedness Directorate will work alongside FEMA to cover the entire spectrum of preparedness, from prevention to response and recovery. The restructuring aims to allow FEMA to focus on its core mission, while the Preparedness Directorate will utilize FEMA's expertise and other skill sets to enhance overall preparedness efforts. The new Preparedness Directorate, created by the Secretary of DHS, aims to enhance FEMA's core mission by focusing on prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts. The Chief Medical Officer will oversee health-related aspects of preparedness, ensuring a coordinated approach to addressing health issues. The Chief Medical Officer will oversee prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts related to health issues in emergency situations. The proposed Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications will focus on analyzing and coordinating information on cyber threats and supporting telecommunications infrastructure for national security. The Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications will support telecommunications infrastructure for national security and emergency communications needs. It aligns with the Department of Homeland Security's reorganization plans to address cyber security threats effectively. The Department of Homeland Security reorganization included transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service to TSA and merging offices to create the new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Office of Security was also returned to its original reporting status to integrate security concerns more effectively with management functions. Secretary Chertoff discussed the proposed relocation of the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC) to the Preparedness Directorate within DHS, emphasizing the need for close linkage between capital preparedness and general preparedness. This move aims to enhance the National Capital's participation in preparedness planning, including biopreparedness, by leveraging its unique perspective on the city's challenges as the seat of government. Secretary Chertoff discussed enhancing the role of the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination within DHS to better address the unique challenges faced by the city as the seat of government. He also mentioned plans for a proposed Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) that would report directly to him, attracting senior personnel from various departments. Additionally, he briefly mentioned plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). Secretary Chertoff discussed plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) to better focus on their respective functions within ICE and TSA. Additionally, a proposed merger of CBP and ICE was considered but did not materialize, with further study requested by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The House Committee on Homeland Security and the acting DHS Inspector General were asked to study the proposed merger of CBP and ICE. Secretary Chertoff took the matter seriously and sought to address the issues in a less drastic manner. Secretary Chertoff considered the problems of the proposed CBP and ICE merger and suggested a less drastic approach. He emphasized the importance of operational collaboration with other components like the Coast Guard and infrastructure protection. By creating a comprehensive border security strategy involving CBP, ICE, and Coast Guard, he believed the identified problems could be addressed. This approach was also discussed at a House Committee hearing on July 25. Secretary Chertoff proposed a restructuring plan to unify operations and policy between CBP, ICE, and the Coast Guard. He highlighted the different functions of CBP and ICE, emphasizing the potential benefits and costs of a merger. In mid-September, a draft report recommended merging CBP and ICE into a single entity, contradicting Secretary Chertoff's 2SR realignment plan. Despite concerns raised, Chertoff expressed confidence in his reforms to address existing problems. Senator Susan Collins raised concerns about Secretary Chertoff's 2SR reforms, noting that his plan lacked comprehensive legislative authority for the fundamental changes he proposed. She urged collaboration with the committee to draft a more comprehensive reauthorization bill, emphasizing the importance of making changes through law rather than just administratively. Senator Collins questioned Secretary Chertoff's broad interpretation of reorganization authority under Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act, suggesting it may not be as expansive as he claimed. Senator Lieberman also seemed to agree with her assessment during the committee discussion. The Homeland Security Act allows for reorganization of organizational units within the Department, with limitations to preserve certain agencies and functions. The term \"organizational units\" is not clearly defined, but it is suggested to be smaller than agencies or entities based on statutory construction analysis. The Homeland Security Act allows reorganization of organizational units within the Department, suggesting they are smaller than agencies or entities. Congress intended for these units to be smaller structures within larger bureaus, impacting the Secretary's authority to reorganize DHS. The Homeland Security Act allows reorganization of organizational units within the Department, which are smaller structures than agencies or entities. Secretary Chertoff's restructuring of DHS resulted in a \"flattening\" of the department, with changes to directorates and lines of reporting to the Secretary/Deputy Secretary. The scope of the term \"organizational units\" is not completely clear, and the new arrangement raised issues for some members of the House Committee on Homeland Security. The restructuring of DHS by Secretary Chertoff resulted in a \"flattening\" of the department, with changes to directorates and lines of reporting. The minority members of the House Committee on Homeland Security raised concerns about the oversight of multiple agencies under this new arrangement, fearing that political staff in the Secretary's office could have too much control. They also expressed frustration with the lack of details provided by Secretary Chertoff, particularly regarding key roles within the department. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for various mistakes, including not merging CBP and ICE as recommended, and not seeking strengthened investigative powers for the DHS Privacy Officer. It also highlighted the need to elevate certain offices in the Management Directorate to strengthen their positions in the department's hierarchy. Additionally, it noted that Congress mandates the Department of Defense to submit a Quadrennial Defense Review every four years. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for not merging CBP and ICE as recommended, and for not seeking strengthened investigative powers for the DHS Privacy Officer. It also highlighted the need to elevate certain offices in the Management Directorate to strengthen their positions in the department's hierarchy. The report noted that Congress mandates the Department of Defense to submit a Quadrennial Defense Review every four years, and lamented that Secretary Chertoff has not indicated he will put in place a long-term planning system like a QDR. The proposal for the reorganization of the department's leadership raised issues regarding the composition of leadership positions, with unclear compensation levels and appointment authority specified. It was uncertain if the Secretary had sufficient authority to establish and make appointments to the top DHS leadership positions without congressional action. Congress has considerable discretion in establishing leadership positions within agencies, determining the hierarchy and accountability to elected officials. This includes appointing officers by the President with Senate approval and creating departmental leadership positions as PAS positions, allowing Senators a role in nominee selection and confirmation hearings. Confirmation hearings provide Senators with oversight over agencies and programs, and a pledge from nominees to appear before Congress when summoned. This commitment makes it easier for Congress to call officers with operational duties before committees. Some positions are appointed solely by the President, mainly in the White House Office, close to the President and privy to confidential policy discussions. The Homeland Security Act created positions in close proximity to the President, with appointment authority given to the Secretary in some cases. Congress may have less influence over these appointments, particularly for lower-level officers. The Act also established Assistant Secretary positions to be filled by the President with Senate consent. The Homeland Security Act created PAS positions for Assistant Secretaries appointed by the President with Senate consent. The Act specified compensation levels for these positions and outlined reorganization proposals for certain Assistant Secretary roles. The Security Administration director was to report directly to the Secretary at Level III of the Executive Schedule. The Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office would be part of the new OPPIA, initially headed by an Assistant Secretary. The President nominated a candidate for this position on July 14, 2005. The reorganization proposed creating new Assistant Secretary positions, including Cyber Security and Telecommunications. The reorganization proposals by Secretary Chertoff included creating several new Assistant Secretary positions, such as Cyber Security and Telecommunications, Grants and Training, International Affairs, Private Sector, and Strategic Plans. It was unclear if these positions would be part of the 12 statutory Assistant Secretaries mandated by the Homeland Security Act or created administratively. The Act also established two additional Assistant Secretary positions appointed solely by the President. The creation of these positions as PA, rather than PAS, was a departure from previous practices in other departments. The President's signing statement endorsed the distinction between these positions and the ones discussed earlier. The President endorsed the creation of two presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary positions, distinct from the 12 statutory Assistant Secretary positions mandated by the Homeland Security Act. These positions, Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis and Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, assisted the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Secretary Chertoff proposed elevating the Information Analysis resources to be a stand-alone entity, with the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection reporting to the new Under Secretary for Preparedness. The potential changes to the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary were not specified in the initial proposal. Secretary Chertoff proposed elevating the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary, renamed as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA). The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was to be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, altering the organizational location, responsibilities, and title of the office. Additionally, two non-career Senior Executive Service positions were created within DHS for program and middle-level managers. The Secretary of Homeland Security appointed key leadership positions, including the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs and other leadership roles like the Director of FEMA and Chief Medical Officer. The proposal did not specify appointment authority or compensation levels. The proposal for key leadership positions in the Department of Homeland Security did not specify appointment authority or compensation levels. There were questions about the organization's hierarchy, with concerns about confusion due to different appointment methods and compensation levels for various officials. The DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments to support Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan, including abolishing the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, dividing the IAIP Directorate, and transferring the FAMS to TSA. The DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments to support Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan, including transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and reorganizing various offices and directorates within the department. The DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments to support Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan, including transferring functions to the Office of Chief Medical Officer and conducting a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. Despite controversy over FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina, Secretary Chertoff proceeded with the reorganization on October 1, 2005. Some confusion surrounds the manner in which the 2SR reorganization was effectuated by Secretary Chertoff in July 2005. Questions have been raised about the extent of his authority to implement the plan. Despite a press release claiming that the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act adopted many of the proposed organizational changes, critics argue that the allocation of funds does not establish new components within the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS appropriations conference committee report discussed the reorganization of the Department of Homeland Security following the Second Stage Review in 2005. The Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security was abolished, functions were merged into other offices, and the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection was split into two new components. State and local grants were moved to the new Preparedness Directorate. The conferees agreed to transfer the Federal Air Marshals to the Transportation Security Administration and expanded the roles of the Office of Policy. However, Secretary Chertoff's plan to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security raised concerns as it would require a statutory pronouncement to be eliminated. Additionally, changes were announced regarding FEMA's operations, including contracting, communications, and disaster-assistance capabilities. Chertoff announced changes to FEMA's operations post-Hurricane Katrina, focusing on improving contracting, communications, disaster-assistance capabilities, and staffing levels. He planned to make FEMA a stand-alone entity within DHS, separate from the Preparedness Directorate. Legislation has been introduced to remove FEMA from DHS and restore its independence. Chertoff also proposed restructuring FEMA to operate efficiently like a modern distribution company. The DHS inspector general's report on the merger of CPB and ICE into a single agency sparked a dispute within the department. Secretary Chertoff and senior officials resisted the merger recommendation, while Congress showed support. DHS Chief Intelligence Officer Charles Allen was tasked with integrating all intelligence capabilities within the department. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, is responsible for integrating intelligence from Homeland Security's component agencies to aid the Secretary in making risk-based decisions. He plans to establish a Homeland Security Intelligence Council to discuss department-wide intelligence issues and drive integration. Allen aims for DHS intelligence to be fully involved in the Intelligence Community and National Intelligence Program as a valued contributor and recipient of national intelligence information. Jeffrey W. Runge, the newly named DHS Chief Medical Officer, emphasized the importance of developing a strategic plan to enhance the Department's medical readiness. He aimed for the DHS Medical Office to be data-driven and science-based, bringing cutting-edge science, technology, and intelligence to policy-making. Plans included appointing a Deputy Chief Medical Officer and three Associate Chief Medical Officers. Jeffrey A. Lowell, former senior medical affairs advisor to the Secretary of Homeland Security and current professor of surgery and pediatrics at Washington University School of Medicine, highlighted the lack of a clearly-defined medical capability within the Department of Homeland Security. He recommended establishing an Office of Medical Readiness led by a Chief Medical Officer with defined duties and responsibilities to improve medical response capabilities and collaborate with other federal partners for seamless integration. The need for a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to lead medical preparedness and response capabilities at all levels of government was emphasized by witnesses during a hearing. David Heyman suggested that the CMO should have a broader role as a Chief Health Officer, providing leadership in various areas beyond medical advice. This includes navigating healthcare systems, disease surveillance, and advising on waste disposal and sanitation. The role of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) extends beyond providing medical advice to include leadership in providing sound scientific, medical, and public health advice, developing situational awareness of biological threats, integrating elements for a national strategy, and leading outreach efforts for educating citizens during health emergencies. Leadership changes have been implemented through the 2SR initiative, with questions remaining about the statutory basis for new appointments. George W. Foresman was confirmed as the Under Secretary for Preparedness, and nominees for new positions at DHS were confirmed during the first session of the 109th Congress. George W. Foresman was confirmed as the Under Secretary for Preparedness on December 17, 2005, while Stewart A. Baker was confirmed as the first Assistant Secretary for Policy on October 7, 2005. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, now known as the Chief Intelligence Officer. Charles E. Allen was appointed to this position on September 18, 2005. Congress may need to clarify the responsibilities and authority of this position, as appointments are made solely by the President. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis position is appointed solely by the President, but the Under Secretary for Preparedness, its successor, does not have authority over it. This change may prompt Congress to reconsider the appointment process for this position. Only one of the five newly created assistant secretary positions required advice and consent by the end of the session. Tracy A. Henke's nomination for the Executive Director of the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness, a statutory PAS position, was pending. The nomination of Tracy A. Henke for the executive director position at the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness was pending as the Senate adjourned. Three out of four newly created assistant secretary positions were established as non-career SES positions, with individuals previously from DHS filling these roles. Alfonso Martinez-Fonts, Jr. was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Private Sector, Cresencio S. Arcos as Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Robert Stephan was to be appointed as Assistant Secretary for Strategic Plans. There were no plans to fill Stephan's former position. In January 2006, there were no plans to fill the former position vacated by Stephan. The appointment of the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications was pending completion of the FY2006 DHS appropriations process. The evolution of the DHS has created three categories of assistant secretaries with varying appointment processes, raising questions about their policymaking authority and responsibility. The evolution of the DHS has created three categories of assistant secretaries with varying appointment processes, raising questions about their policymaking authority and responsibility. Assistant secretaries from each category will have the same level of policymaking authority, but those subject to Senate confirmation may undergo greater scrutiny and be more accountable to Congress. The Chief Medical Officer position was filled on September 4, 2005, by Jeffrey W. Runge. Chertoff appointed Jeffrey W. Runge as the Chief Medical Officer in the newly created Preparedness Directorate. Vayl Oxford was appointed as the Director of the Nuclear Detection Office. R. David Paulison continued as the Acting Director of FEMA. The status of the Director of Operations Coordination position was unclear. Congress may evaluate the leadership structure of DHS and consider codifying existing arrangements or alternative ones through H.R. 4009, the Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005. The proposal for reorganizing DHS includes a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and the establishment of an Office of Intelligence and Analysis headed by a Chief Intelligence Officer. It abolishes the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Preparedness Directorate. The proposal for reorganizing DHS includes transforming Information Analysis into the Chief Intelligence Officer position, abolishing the IAIP Directorate, establishing a task force on protecting security-relevant private sector information, redesignating EP&R as the Preparedness and Response Directorate, and appointing an Assistant Secretary for Preparedness. The reorganization of DHS includes establishing an Assistant Secretary for Preparedness within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, with oversight of federal programs and relationships with state and local authorities. It also abolishes certain offices and establishes a Director of FEMA appointed by the President. The reorganization of DHS includes establishing a Deputy Director of FEMA appointed by the President, with Senate confirmation, and a Chief Medical Officer within the Preparedness and Response Directorate. It also merges CBP and ICE into a single operational unit, strengthens the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer, and abolishes the Under Secretary for Management. The reorganization of DHS includes establishing a Deputy Director of FEMA appointed by the President, with Senate confirmation, and a Chief Medical Officer within the Preparedness and Response Directorate. It also merges CBP and ICE into a single operational unit, strengthens the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer, and abolishes the Under Secretary for Management. Functions of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Human Capital Officer are prescribed to exercise joint authority over financial, information, and human capital officers in component agencies of DHS. A Business Transformation Officer is established within DHS to develop a management integration strategy. DHS employees can file complaints with the Department of Labor for retaliation related to reporting security concerns. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005 establishes various offices within DHS, including the Office of Tribal Security and the National Cybersecurity Office. It also addresses retaliation against whistle blowers and the secure handling of ammonium nitrate. Introduced by Senator Susan Collins and Senator John Warner, the bill aims to enhance security measures within the Department. S. 1866, the Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Susan Collins and Senator John Warner, amends the Homeland Security Act to establish an Under Secretary for Policy in the Department of Homeland Security."
