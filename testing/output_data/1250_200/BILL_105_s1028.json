    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct a pilot project to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource management activities. The Secretary of Agriculture is mandated to implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of resource management activities as per the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The pilot project will be conducted in designated Federal lands in California, excluding spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities. During the pilot project in designated Federal lands in California, resource management activities, road building, and timber harvesting will be deferred in specified areas. Riparian protection guidelines will apply to all resource management activities conducted in the project area. During the pilot project in designated Federal lands in California, resource management activities, road building, and timber harvesting will be deferred in specified areas. Guidelines from a Forest Service research document dated March 1993, co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team, including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas, will apply to all resource management activities. Compliance with applicable Federal law and conservation standards for the California spotted owl is required for all resource management activities. During the pilot project on designated Federal lands in California, resource management activities will be carried out according to the California Spotted Owl Sierran Provence Interim Guidelines. This includes fuelbreak construction and forest management using group and individual tree selection methods to achieve a fire-resilient forest condition. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through group and individual tree selection methods on a limited acreage of the pilot project area each year. Riparian management and cost-effectiveness are also key components of the project. Funding will be utilized efficiently as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will use cost-effective means to implement resource management activities for the pilot project. Funding sources include specific funds provided by the Secretary and excess funds allocated for certain national forests. Prohibition on using funds from other National Forest System units is in place, with flexibility subject to reprogramming guidelines during the project term. During the pilot project, forest supervisors of Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests can use excess funds for resource management activities. Restrictions apply to prevent limiting other multiple use activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12 percent of available funds. During the pilot project, forest supervisors of Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests can use excess funds for resource management activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12 percent of available funds, with at least 88 percent required for implementing activities. Authorized supplemental funds are available as necessary, and baseline funds must meet existing levels for resource management activities. The pilot project will run until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions or for a maximum of five years after commencement. The Forest Service may use private contracts to carry out requirements of the pilot project in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. The Regional Forester for Region 5 must initiate the process to amend land and resource management plans for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests within 180 days of the Act's enactment, including incorporating the pilot project and other proposed changes. The Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal includes changes based on environmental analyses and laws. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the pilot project's status, detailing fund usage and accounts. The annual report to Congress on the pilot project must include details on fund usage, accounts, total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues and costs incurred. The annual report on the pilot project must detail management activities, revenues, costs, resource management schedule, environmental impacts, and a limitation on expenditures. A final report will assess the project's effectiveness in meeting its goals, including watershed monitoring. The pilot project assessment and report must include watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 for watershed monitoring in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The pilot project assessment and report must not exceed $75,000 for each of fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Nothing in this section exempts the pilot project from any Federal environmental law."
