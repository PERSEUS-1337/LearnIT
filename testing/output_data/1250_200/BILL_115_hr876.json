SEC. 3. COST AND FEASIBILITY STUDY. The Administrator must conduct a cost and feasibility study on implementing security measures at various airports, including secure doors, surveillance video recording, and advanced screening technologies. The study required by the Administrator includes costs of employee screening at airports with 100% screening, comparing costs and effectiveness for security features, and a review by the Comptroller General for quality and reliability assessment.
