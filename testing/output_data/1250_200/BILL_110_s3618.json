    "content": "The Act titled \"Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008\" focuses on advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program. The Act \"Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008\" defines terms like advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle, greenhouse gas, plug-in hybrid vehicle, program, and retrofit. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to provide grants for projects advancing research and development of advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles through retrofitting existing fuel-powered vehicles. The program will have specific requirements for grant applications and selection criteria based on the ability of applicants to complete project phases. The Secretary of Energy will prioritize grant applicants based on their ability to fill research gaps, advance technology, and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Applicants can partner with other entities for projects. The Secretary will publish application requests within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will publish a request for grant applications in the Federal Register, with a deadline of 90 days for submission. Within 90 days of the deadline, grant recipients will be selected through a competitive process. The number of grants awarded will be determined based on technical merits, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 grants. The program will award 3 to 7 grants, with at least half promoting plug-in hybrid vehicle technology. Recipients can receive up to $3,000,000 per year for a 3-year project. Grant recipients must complete 2 phases, including research and demonstration of advanced hybrid technology. The grant program awards funding for advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Recipients must submit a report on vehicle performance, component testing, cost projections, and emission levels. The Secretary has the authority to terminate the grant program if necessary. The grant program for advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles includes testing procedures and two phases. Phase 1 lasts for 1 year and Phase 2 focuses on demonstrating advanced manufacturing processes. The Secretary can terminate the program if recipients fail to meet requirements. Phase 2 of the grant program involves demonstrating advanced manufacturing processes by producing or retrofitting 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. A report analyzing technological challenges, manufacturing costs, and sale prices must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days of completion. Phase 2 begins after Phase 1 and lasts for 2 years. Research on Vehicle Usage and Alternative Drive Trains: The Secretary will conduct research into alternative power train designs for advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles, comparing costs and performance with nonhybrid designs based on factors like miles driven, idle time, horsepower requirements, and power output needs. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 60 days of receiving reports from grant recipients, detailing grant recipients, projects funded, applicants, data from reports, vehicles produced or retrofitted, fuel efficiency analysis, and research results. Coordination with other programs and cost sharing requirements will be in line with existing regulations. The Department of Energy will establish a pilot program to research the effects of plug-in hybrid vehicles on the electric grid. $16,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2011, with limitations on how the funds can be used. SEC. 3. EXPANDING RESEARCH IN HYBRID TECHNOLOGY FOR LARGE VEHICLES. Amends the United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 to include research on vehicles over 16,000 pounds."
