Uninsured children are less likely to have medical visits, immunizations, and rely more on emergency rooms. A child's insurance status depends on parents' employer-sponsored coverage or public programs like Medicaid. In 2009, about 8.3 million children in the United States, or 10.4% of children, had no health insurance. The state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) allows states to cover low-income children with no health insurance. Some disabled children are eligible for Medicare, while others have insurance from policies purchased in the small-group market or military benefits. This report examines the health insurance status of children under age 19 in 2009, looking at the relationship between types of health insurance and the characteristics of the child and parents. The report analyzes childhood uninsurance data from 2009, collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS) by the Census Bureau. The CPS is a monthly survey of households used to collect employment data, with the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) gathering health insurance status, income, and poverty information. Statistical techniques adjust the data to represent all households in the nation, making the March Supplement to the CPS a widely used source for such data. The March Supplement to the CPS is a key source for estimating levels of uninsurance in the United States. The report focuses on the uninsured status of children in 2009, analyzing their demographic and employment characteristics. The percentage of uninsured children varied by age, with 9.2% for children under 6 and 12.5% for those between 13 and 18 years old. Public insurance decreased with age, while employer-sponsored coverage increased. In 2009, children under age 6 had 52.1% employer-sponsored insurance and 39.9% public insurance, while children between 13 and 18 had 60.6% employer-sponsored insurance and 26.9% public insurance. Hispanic children had the highest uninsurance rates (17.5%) and lowest employer-sponsored coverage (35.0%). Black or Hispanic children were more likely to have public coverage than white or Asian children. Children in the Northwest or Midwest were less likely to be uninsured (7.3% and 7.8%) compared to those in the South or West (13.0% and 11.0%). Employer-sponsored health insurance covered about 63% of children in the Northeast and Midwest, and about 53% in the South and West. In 2009, employer-sponsored health insurance covered about 63% of children in the Northeast and Midwest, and about 53% in the South and West. Citizens are more likely to have employer-sponsored coverage than noncitizens. Native-born and naturalized children had similar rates of employer-sponsored health insurance, at 57.7% and 58.3%, respectively. Children living with a single father were more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance than those living with a single mother, but were also more likely to be uninsured due to lower public coverage rates. In 2009, children living with a single mother were less likely to have public coverage, leading to higher rates of being uninsured. Private health insurance coverage varied with income, with children in low-income families more likely to have public coverage. A child's insurance source was strongly linked to their parents' coverage. Children living with uninsured parents were more likely to be uninsured, but also had public coverage. There was a relationship between a child's insurance status and their parent(s)' employment characteristics. In 2009, there was a relationship between children's insurance status and their parents' employment characteristics. Children with at least one parent working full-time had higher rates of employer-sponsored health insurance (71.2%) compared to those with parents working part-time (31.6%). Public insurance coverage helped fill the gaps for those without employer-sponsored coverage. Employer-sponsored coverage was less common in small firms compared to larger firms. In evaluating groups of uninsured children, it is crucial to choose an appropriate comparison group. Different representations of data can lead to varying conclusions. For instance, looking at the total number of uninsured children, one might mistakenly conclude that uninsurance is highest among two-parent families. This is because a significant percentage of uninsured children live with two parents, while a smaller percentage live with a single mother or father. It is essential to consider all comparisons relative to the total number of uninsured children. In comparing uninsured children based on family structure, it is important to consider the percentage within each group. While two-parent households have the largest number of uninsured children, those living with a single parent are more likely to be uninsured. This paradox arises because the group with the lowest uninsurance rate (two-parent families) can still have a large number of uninsured children due to their larger population size. These findings have implications for policymakers seeking to reduce uninsurance rates. The report discusses the disparities in uninsured children based on family structure and the implications for policymakers. It shifts focus to analyzing trends in insurance and uninsurance from 1999 to 2009, including the impact of economic recessions on children's health coverage. The data highlights the potential increase in uninsured children during recessions due to job losses and loss of employer-sponsored health insurance. During economic recessions, job losses can lead to a drop in employer-sponsored health insurance for parents, potentially increasing the uninsurance rate for children. However, a decrease in parental income may make children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, preventing an increase in uninsurance. Legislative changes, such as the ARRA in 2009, can also help reduce the number of uninsured children by providing financial assistance for health coverage. The uninsurance rate for children fluctuated between 1999 and 2009, with no significant impact from economic recessions. However, there were larger changes in children's insurance status over the 10-year period. The number of children covered by employer-sponsored insurance fell from 65.2% in 1999 to 55.8% in 2009, contributing to an increase in the uninsurance rate for children. On the other hand, the number of children covered by public health insurance (Medicaid and CHIP) increased from 20.3% in 1999 to 33.8% in 2009, possibly due to factors like ARRA providing a temporary increase in federal Medicaid payments to states. The increase in children covered by public health insurance (Medicaid and CHIP) from 20.3% in 1999 to 33.8% in 2009 was influenced by factors like ARRA's maintenance of effort requirement for Medicaid and the increase in CHIP enrollment. This offset the decrease in children covered by employer-sponsored insurance, which fell from 65.2% to 55.8% during the same period. Between 1999 and 2009, the increase in children covered by public health insurance offset the decrease in children covered by employer-sponsored insurance, leading to a stabilization in the percentage of uninsured children."
