    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that an atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management relationships is crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The tactic of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of harassment that threatens the balance of collective bargaining rights. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm. Employers should not discriminate based on employees' views on collective bargaining, but should have the right to expect job performance. Employees' views on collective bargaining should not be a basis for discrimination by employers. Employers have the right to expect job applicants to be focused on using their skills to further the business goals. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire disruptive individuals.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. Amends Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals seeking employment for the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to certify single location bargaining units. A blanket rule limiting factors for unit appropriateness goes against the goal of labor relations stability.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\nThis title aims to ensure the National Labor Relations Board conducts a detailed analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit based on all relevant facts.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. SEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to require a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of an employer. Factors considered include functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations face disadvantages when dealing with actions from the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field. Therefore, this title aims to award fees and costs to certain small entities when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board. The purpose of this section is to ensure that organizations are not discouraged from challenging actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to costs, to address the resource disparity between small businesses/labor organizations and the Board, and to hold the Board accountable by awarding fees and costs to entities that prevail against it. SEC. 302 amends the National Labor Relations Act to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 outlines the conditions under which an employer or labor organization with specific size and financial criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in administrative and court proceedings under certain circumstances. Employers or labor organizations meeting specific size and financial criteria may be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in judicial review proceedings by the Board, regardless of the justification of the United States' position. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of the Act."
