The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for FY2008, including $310 million for state grants. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the SDFSC program in FY2006. The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (SDFSC) through FY2007. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The SDFSC program aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools through state grants and national programs. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (SDFSC) is reauthorized through FY2007, with $650 million authorized for state grants and national programs to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. Funds are distributed to states based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program is reauthorized through FY2007 with $650 million authorized for state grants and national programs. States receive grants based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Each state receives an equal proportional share of its FY2006 grant if total appropriations are less than the FY2001 level. State grant funds can be redistributed if not used within two years. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program reauthorized through FY2007 with $650 million for state grants and national programs. States receive grants based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts to various entities. SEAs must distribute at least 93% of funds to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs can use up to 2% for administrative costs. SEAs can use up to 3% for program administration. In FY2002, SEAs could use 1% of their allotment for a management information system. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program reauthorized through FY2007 with $650 million for state grants and national programs. Funds were used to create the UMIRS to collect information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. SEAs could use up to 5% of funds for capacity building and program improvement. PART was used to evaluate the SDFSC state grants component in 2002 and 2006. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated as \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 due to a lack of demonstrated program effectiveness and funds being spread too thinly. The program provided inadequate funding to most LEAs, hindering the implementation of effective drug prevention and school safety programs. As a result of the PART assessment and budget constraints in FY2007, the Administration proposed to terminate the state grants program in favor of higher-priority national programs within SDFSC. The national program component of SDFSC was seen as more promising in achieving important results and enlarging the nation's knowledge base on effective drug and violence prevention methods. The Administration believed that national programs provided direct support and sufficient funding to make a difference, allowing for progress assessment and effectiveness measurement. The Department of Education planned to use national survey data to determine the extent of teen drug use and violence in the nation and evaluate the impact of interventions. The ED is evaluating the impact of interventions for SDFSC programs using rigorous methodology. National programs provide funding for preventing violence and drug use among students. Funds may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the program and continuing the SS/HS initiative. The National Coordinator Initiative allows LEAs to recruit coordinators for middle schools. The ED funded programs to prevent violence and drug use among students, including recruiting coordinators for middle schools. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004, with funds potentially available as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants could also be awarded to develop programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. LEAs can develop programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for hate crime affected areas, a School Security Technology and Resource Center, and a National Center for School and Youth Safety. The government is working on improving school security by establishing a National Center for School and Youth Safety, providing emergency assistance, setting up a student hotline, and compiling information on violence prevention. Funding requests for the program have increased over the years, with the President requesting $324.2 million for FY2008 and the House Appropriations Committee recommending $526.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs in FY2007, which is $6.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. For FY2008, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program. The President did not request funding for the mentoring program in FY2008. In FY2007, $19 million was requested for the mentoring program as it was the final year of a phase-out. Congress appropriated $32.7 million for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program in FY2005 and FY2006. In FY2005 and FY2006, Congress allocated $32.7 million for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program. In FY2006, funding was slightly reduced to $32.4 million due to a 1% rescission. For FY2007, the House did not recommend funding for the program, but the Senate proposed $32.4 million. The Gun-Free Schools Act is part of the program, requiring states to expel students bringing weapons to school for one year, with exceptions allowed by LEAs. The Gun-Free Schools Act prohibits LEAs from providing educational services to expelled students in an alternative setting. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements, report expulsion details to the SEA, and have a policy for reporting students with firearms. Exceptions apply for lawfully stored firearms and approved activities. Bills related to school safety in the 109th Congress mostly died, except for H.R. 3010. In the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, but most died except for H.R. 3010. H.R. 3010, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, was amended by the Senate to evaluate the effectiveness of violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA. Other measures introduced included bills addressing bullying, gang prevention, school violence prevention, student and teacher safety, drug-free varsity sports, and fighting gangs. In the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 5295, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006; S. 1974, the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005; and S. 4028, Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006. The Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) aimed to cover bullying and gang prevention under SDFSCA, with H.R. 284 also focusing on bullying and harassment prevention programs. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) and the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to address bullying and harassment in schools. H.R. 3655 directed the Education Secretary to improve prevention programs, while H.R. 5295 required policies for searching students under suspicion. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) and the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to address drug use in high school students and reauthorize the SDFSCA with increased funding levels. The bill aimed to increase state grants authorization to $700 million for FY2007 and national programs to $400 million. It required hiring gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators in LEAs, reserved $40 million for the National Coordinator Initiative, and $50 million for mentoring program grants. Priority for grants would be given to entities serving children in rural, high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. Additionally, it included an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to combat gang activity in schools. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to assist schools in combating gang activity by allowing students in unsafe environments to transfer to safer schools within the same district. The bill also includes provisions for counseling and removal of offenders. The bill H.R. 354 allows students who are victims of violent crimes in school, on school grounds, while riding a school bus, or attending a school function to transfer to a safe school within the same district. It differs from current law by expanding the scope of victimization and providing the option of counseling or removal of the offender. No further action has occurred on H.R. 354, which was referred to the House Education and Labor Committee. In the 110th Congress, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) may be considered for reauthorization. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to support LEAs in creating safe school environments. They propose consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program focusing on emergencies, violence prevention, school culture, and improving the learning environment. Congress may also consider requiring schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. The Administration suggests restructuring the SDFSC program to enhance school safety by consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program. Consideration is given to transferring responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education to the Department of Justice due to the latter's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. Education and curriculum-based programs could remain at ED in collaboration with public health experts at HHS. School safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs and funding might be placed under the direction of DOJ for its public safety expertise. Legislation could allow K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for increased security against possible terrorist attacks. Consideration should be given to making K-12 schools eligible for national Critical Infrastructure programs. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA may have unintended consequences, leading to pressure on state education officials to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools would never meet the criteria. Legal concerns may arise from these definitions. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous schools, which could impact their funding opportunities for violence prevention grants. The lack of funding for schools identified as persistently dangerous hinders their ability to improve safety programs, while federal and state budgets cut school safety funds. Different states may have varying definitions of persistently dangerous schools, leading to potential legal concerns."
