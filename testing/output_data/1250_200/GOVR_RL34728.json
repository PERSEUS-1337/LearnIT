    "content": "Persons with disabilities may struggle to find suitable housing with supportive services due to accessibility issues, discrimination, zoning laws, affordability concerns, and lower employment rates. Limited income can make in-home care and services unaffordable, and state funding through Medicaid varies. These challenges make it difficult for individuals with disabilities to secure housing. Funding for home and community-based services through Medicaid varies by state, leading to challenges for persons with disabilities in finding suitable housing. National recognition of the need for appropriate housing for persons with disabilities increased after the 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which required states to provide community-based treatment for individuals with mental disabilities. President Bush announced the \"New Freedom Initiative\" after the Olmstead ruling to ensure full participation in society for persons with disabilities. The federal government provides funds for subsidized rental housing through HUD, including the Section 811 program for persons with disabilities. Accessible and affordable housing remains a challenge for many states and communities. The Section 811 program is not the only source of funds for housing for persons with disabilities. Other HUD programs like Section 202, Public Housing, Section 8, and block grant programs are also used to fund housing for this population. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is another source of funds. This report discusses how federal funds are used for housing for persons with disabilities and current issues surrounding this. The report discusses federal funding for housing for persons with disabilities, including the Section 811 program and issues like mixed financing arrangements, worst case housing needs, and homelessness among persons with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act ensures accessible rental housing for individuals with disabilities, regardless of whether the housing was specifically designed for them. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on \"handicap,\" defining it as having a physical or mental impairment that limits major life activities. Housing providers have affirmative duties to make housing accessible to persons with disabilities. Starting in 1988, it became unlawful for multifamily housing developers to design and construct housing that is not accessible to persons with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make accommodations for persons with disabilities, including wheelchair accessible features in bathrooms and kitchens, as well as allowing for reasonable modifications and accommodations to ensure equal enjoyment of the premises. The Fair Housing Act mandates housing providers to accommodate persons with disabilities by allowing reasonable modifications to ensure equal enjoyment of the premises. Landlords may require tenants to deposit funds for modifications, which must have a direct relationship to the tenant's disability. Landlords may require tenants to deposit funds for restoration when moving out. Funding for home modifications for tenants with disabilities may be available at the state or local level through programs like Medicaid waiver programs or grant/loan programs using federal funds. Landlords must also make \"reasonable accommodations\" for tenants with disabilities under the Fair Housing Act. Under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), landlords must provide \"reasonable accommodations\" for tenants with disabilities to ensure they can use and enjoy their dwelling. These accommodations may involve exceptions to rules or policies that would otherwise apply, as long as they do not pose an undue financial burden or fundamentally alter the provider's operations. Tenants cannot be charged extra fees for reasonable accommodations, and examples include changing rental payment methods for tenants with mental illnesses or allowing assistance animals in pet-restricted buildings. This report discusses HUD housing programs for persons with disabilities, including Section 811 Supportive Housing, Public Housing, and Section 8 programs. The Section 811 program defines \"person with disabilities\" as those aged 18-62, including families. Definitions vary among programs, with Section 811 used as a baseline for comparison. See the Appendix for a table comparing definitions. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as an individual aged 18-62 with a physical, mental, or emotional impairment that substantially impedes their ability to live independently. This includes individuals with developmental disabilities and chronic mental illness. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as an individual aged 18-62 with a physical, mental, or emotional impairment that substantially impedes their ability to live independently. This includes individuals with developmental disabilities, chronic mental illness, acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcoholism, or drug addiction. According to regulations, a person with HIV, alcoholism, or drug addiction may be considered disabled if they also meet the Section 811 statute's definition of disability. A person is considered to have a developmental disability if they have a severe, chronic disability that manifests before age 22 and results in substantial functional limitations in at least three major life activities. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as an individual aged 18-62 with physical, mental, or emotional impairments that substantially impede their ability to live independently. Developmental disability is characterized by impairments that manifest before age 22, continue indefinitely, and result in substantial limitations in major life activities. The definition also includes the need for individually planned care and services for a lifetime or extended duration. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as an individual aged 18-62 with physical, mental, or emotional impairments that substantially impede their ability to live independently. It also includes persons who are considered disabled under Title II of the Social Security Act, which defines disability as the inability to work due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. The Section 8/Public Housing definition of disability includes those living with AIDS or conditions arising from its etiologic agent, but does not exclude those with a diagnosis of HIV positive. The Section 8/Public Housing regulation includes individuals with HIV positive diagnosis and those disabled by HIV/AIDS for housing eligibility under the Section 202 loan program. Eligibility depends on the nature of the disability, such as physical, developmental, or mental illnesses. The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, administered by HUD, funds permanent supportive housing for very low-income individuals with disabilities. It provides capital grants for construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of buildings for housing, with a focus on maintaining affordability for at least 40 years. Tenant-based vouchers were also funded until 2011. The Section 811 program provides affordable housing for very low-income individuals with disabilities for at least 40 years. It used to fund tenant-based vouchers until 2011, but now focuses on subsidizing units developed with capital funding from other sources. This program was established in 1990 as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez Affordable Housing Act. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, created in 1959, expanded to include individuals with disabilities such as developmental disabilities and chronic mental illnesses. Congress later created the Section 811 program specifically for persons with disabilities, but units under Section 202 continue to be financed and governed by its rules. Initially, Section 202 provided housing for elderly individuals, but in 1964, non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals were also included. The Housing Act of 1964 expanded the Section 202 program to include non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals with physical impairments that impede independent living. Mental, intellectual, or developmental disabilities were not initially included in the definition. The program was renamed \"Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped,\" but did not mandate accessible units for tenants with disabilities. Participation by non-elderly handicapped individuals remained low between 1964 and 1977. The Housing Act of 1964 expanded the Section 202 program to include non-elderly individuals with physical impairments. In 1974, the definition of handicap was expanded to include developmental disabilities. Congress acknowledged the confusion regarding eligibility for mentally ill individuals in Section 202 housing in 1978. HUD was directed to develop criteria for providing housing for this population. In 1978, HUD initiated a demonstration program with the Department of Health and Human Services to understand the housing needs of the mentally ill. The Section 202 program funded housing for chronically mentally ill individuals in FY1982, including group homes and independent living facilities. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 required at least $50 million to be allocated for housing for non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals in Section 202 projects to address special needs not previously met. The Section 202 program funded housing for elderly residents, with a small number of units dedicated to persons with disabilities. The low number of accessible units was due to the additional cost, but a set-aside was implemented to address this issue. Non-profit sponsors were expected to develop innovative ways of providing housing for persons with disabilities. After the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, more developments were built specifically for these households. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 increased developments for persons with disabilities. By the late 1980s, 10% of Section 202 units were for persons with disabilities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 required 15% of Section 202 loans for persons with disabilities, later increased to 25%. This law also provided rental subsidies for these units. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 required a percentage of Section 202 loans to be allocated for persons with disabilities, with rental subsidies provided. P.L. 100-242 specified separate rental assistance for housing for persons with disabilities based on development and operating costs, excluding supportive services. This separate subsidy program was in place until the creation of the Section. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 mandated a portion of Section 202 loans for persons with disabilities, with separate rental assistance based on development and operating costs. This separate subsidy program continued until the establishment of the Section 811 program in the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625), which completely separated housing for persons with disabilities from the Section 202 program. The financing method for Section 202 and Section 811 developments was also changed under P.L. 101-625. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625) changed the financing method for Section 202 and Section 811 developments. It introduced capital grants instead of loans, with a requirement for units to remain affordable for 40 years. The law also created project rental assistance contracts (PRAC) and adjusted development cost limitations to include features for persons with disabilities. The Section 811 program was established separately from Section 202 to better serve individuals with disabilities. The Committee created a separate program from Section 202 to meet the housing needs of nonelderly persons with disabilities. This separation aimed to develop a bureaucracy knowledgeable about the special needs of tenants with disabilities and create an institutional voice for their housing concerns. The program also emphasized changing terminology to refer to \"persons with disabilities\" instead of \"handicapped persons\" and promoting community integration. The Section 811 program, separate from Section 202, focuses on housing options for nonelderly persons with disabilities. It authorizes capital grants and project rental assistance, with recent changes made by the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act in 2010. This Act reauthorized the program from FY2011 to FY2015 at $300 million per year, emphasizing community integration for Section 811 units. The Section 811 program, reauthorized from FY2011 to FY2015 at $300 million per year, allows rental assistance for multifamily housing units developed with various funding sources. P.L. 111-374 limits the number of units occupied by persons with disabilities to 25% to encourage developers to use other funding sources. This limitation does not apply to group homes or independent living facilities. The Melville Act introduced changes to the Section 811 program, allowing funding from sources like LIHTCs and HOME funds to supplement Section 811 funding. The 25% unit limitation does not apply to group homes or independent living facilities. Grantees combining Section 811 capital grants with other funding sources will have project processing delegated to state or local housing finance agencies for efficiency. These changes could shift towards integrating units for persons with disabilities into larger developments. The rationale behind the changes is that Section 811 funding can be more effectively utilized if not solely used for capital costs. Funding for the Section 811 program is distributed as capital grants and project rental assistance to nonprofit housing sponsors. The capital grants are used to build or rehabilitate housing for persons with disabilities and their families. HUD allocates funds to multifamily hubs based on the number of non-institutionalized persons with disabilities in the area. Grantees do not have to repay the capital grants as long as the housing remains affordable for very low-income tenants with disabilities. Additionally, project sponsors receive rental assistance from HUD to cover operating costs. Project sponsors receive rental assistance from HUD to bridge the gap between resident rent payments and operating costs. They must also ensure residents in Section 811 housing receive supportive services. Approximately 27,000 Section 811 units receive rental assistance. HUD awarded $149 million to 92 projects in 34 states by combining FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations. The Section 811 program's components, including housing types and regulations, are described. Multifamily rental housing for persons with disabilities has evolved since the enactment of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act. The Section 811 program includes small developments with rental units for persons with disabilities. Rental units for persons with disabilities developed from 2011 onwards are limited to 25% of total units in a building. Group homes can accommodate up to eight individuals with disabilities, with a maximum of six residents as per HUD guidelines. Independent living facilities have individual units for residents, with a maximum occupancy of 24 persons with disabilities per development. Independent living facilities for persons with disabilities have separate bedrooms, kitchens, and baths for each resident, with a maximum occupancy of 24 individuals. The maximum number of persons in a facility is restricted to 14 if housing for persons with disabilities already exists on the site. Units for persons with disabilities cannot exceed 25% of a larger multifamily development. Condominium units follow similar standards as independent living facilities, with separate bedrooms, baths, and kitchens for each resident. The HUD NOFA outlines standards for maximum number of units in independent living facilities for persons with disabilities. Project sponsors can choose to serve residents with physical disability, developmental disability, or chronic mental illness. Residency can be further restricted with HUD approval. Qualified applicants cannot be denied based on a broader disability category, but can be denied based on a specific subcategory. Applicants for Section 811 funds must justify restricting residency by disability categories and show the need for non-integrated settings. Nonprofit organizations awarded grants for Section 811 housing enter into PRAC contracts with HUD for rental assistance. Residents must be \"very low income\" and pay a percentage of their income as rent. Section 811 housing requires residents to pay a percentage of their income as rent, with supportive services available to help them live independently. Services are tailored to individual needs, including health and mental health, but Section 811 funds cannot be used for supportive services. Section 811 housing provides supportive services for residents' health and individual needs, but the funds cannot be used for these services. Owners can offer services directly or coordinate with outside agencies. Organizations applying for Section 811 grants must submit a certified supportive services plan detailing the population's needs, community service providers, provider experience, and agency involvement. The Section 811 program requires applicants to submit letters of intent from service providers, detail provider experience, describe state and local agency involvement, and commit to providing services for residents. Rental assistance funds can now be used for multifamily housing units developed with other funding sources. Restrictions apply to the use of rental assistance for existing units and the allocation of units for persons with disabilities. The Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program requires recipients of rental assistance to operate units as supportive housing for persons with disabilities for at least 30 years. HUD has allocated funds for the PRA program from FY2012-FY2014 appropriations, awarding funds in two rounds. Eligible applicants are state agencies administering Low Income Housing Tax Credits or the HOME Investment Partnership program. Funding is provided for the first five years, with subsequent years subject to appropriation. The Section 811 program differs from the original program. State agencies administering Low Income Housing Tax Credits or the HOME Investment Partnership program are eligible applicants. Nonprofit organizations cannot apply for funding. Grantees must provide rental assistance to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities. Units developed with Section 811 capital grants are for low-income residents. Applicants must partner with state health and human services agencies and Medicaid agencies. Only one application per state is allowed. The Section 811 program allows state agencies administering Low Income Housing Tax Credits or the HOME Investment Partnership program to apply for funding to provide rental assistance to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities. Only one application per state is allowed for this program. Tenant-based rental assistance is provided through vouchers, where tenants pay a portion of their income towards rent and HUD covers the rest, subject to certain limits. The Section 811 program provides rental assistance to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities. Tenant-based rental assistance is offered through vouchers, where tenants contribute towards rent and HUD covers the difference. Section 811 vouchers have now been transitioned to the tenant-based Section 8 rental assistance account. Additionally, Section 8 vouchers are used in collaboration with the Medicaid-funded \"Money Follows the Person\" program to help individuals with disabilities transition from institutions to the community. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 authorized the use of vouchers for eligible households, known as \"mainstream vouchers.\" The Section 811 program provides rental assistance to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities through mainstream vouchers. These vouchers are administered similarly to Section 8 vouchers, with funding initially coming from the Section 811 account for five-year terms. Private nonprofit organizations became eligible to administer the vouchers in FY1999. Funding for new vouchers ceased in FY2006, with HUD making them available through an annual Notice of Funding Availability process. Since FY2006, Congress has not funded new Section 811 vouchers. HUD administers these vouchers through an annual process where PHAs and nonprofit organizations apply. Applicants are scored based on factors like the number of disabled individuals in poverty in the area and agreements for supportive services. Voucher administrators are required to assist disabled individuals in obtaining supportive services and provide technical assistance to landlords for accommodations. In 2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers shifted to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers shifted to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. P.L. 111-374 authorized appropriations to convert existing vouchers to Section 8 assistance. HUD reported 13,905 vouchers funded through the Section 811 account. Additionally, Section 8 vouchers are set aside for families with disabled members. Congress appropriated funds for designated housing vouchers in response to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550) allowed owners of Public Housing and project-based Section 8 developments to prioritize elderly tenants or designate buildings as elderly-only. This impacted the ability of tenants with disabilities to live in these developments. Congress later appropriated funds for Section 8 vouchers to assist eligible tenants with disabilities affected by these policy changes. PHAs must assist tenants in finding supportive services and provide technical assistance to landlords for accommodations. Congress appropriated funds for designated housing vouchers for residents with disabilities. An issue arises when vouchers are given up, whether they go to another person with a disability or all eligible families. NOFAs specified that Section 811 vouchers should remain available to disabled families during the initial funding term. Advocates for persons with disabilities have raised concerns about Section 811 vouchers being provided to non-disabled households after the original tenant leaves the program. Congress mandated that Section 811 vouchers be made available to disabled families upon turnover, and HUD began tracking the disability status of families using these vouchers in 2004. Unlike Section 811 mainstream vouchers, Section 8 designated housing vouchers for persons with disabilities are to remain available to other disabled households \"to the extent practicable.\" HUD defines this as providing vouchers to non-disabled households only if no disabled families are eligible. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act changed the law in 2011 to ensure that Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based vouchers for persons with disabilities are treated the same. The Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration was extended through FY2016 to provide assistance to qualified persons with disabilities. The Money Follows the Person program, authorized through FY2011 and extended through FY2016, allows states to use Medicaid funds to help elderly and disabled individuals transition from institutional settings to home- and community-based care. Most participants are non-elderly persons with disabilities, with funds used for services post-transition and supplemental services for the transition. The Money Follows the Person program allows grantees to use funds for supplemental services like housing-related assistance for MFP participants. Finding permanent housing is a challenge for transition programs like MFP, with affordable and accessible housing being a key determinant of success. The Money Follows the Person program faces challenges with finding affordable and accessible housing for participants, as noted in a 2015 report. HUD allocated Section 8 vouchers for individuals transitioning from institutions to the community, with approximately 1,000 vouchers awarded to eligible housing authorities in 15 states in 2011. HUD awarded housing vouchers to eligible housing authorities in 15 states in 2011, which may have increased the rate of transition for persons with physical disabilities. The Section 811 program is dedicated to persons with disabilities, while HUD also funds housing for persons with disabilities through various programs. Property owners participating in the Section 8 rental assistance program and Public Housing Authorities can designate buildings for elderly residents, residents with disabilities, or a mix of both. Public housing, created in 1937, provides housing for low-income families, with tenants paying 30% of their income as rent. In 1960, the first elderly-only public housing was built, and in 1961, individuals with disabilities were included. Controversy surrounds developments for elderly residents and residents with disabilities living together. The number of residents with disabilities living in public housing for the elderly began to increase in the 1980s and early 1990s due to the availability of outpatient mental health care and the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act. This led to an increase in younger residents with disabilities, often with mental illnesses and addictions, resulting in a greater number of incidents of disruptive behavior reported by Public Housing Authorities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and The Public Housing Opportunity Extension Act of 1996 allowed Public Housing Authorities to designate buildings for elderly only, disabled only, or mixed populations. PHAs must submit plans to HUD for approval to change building compositions, and approved plans cannot result in eviction of non-eligible residents. HUD provides data on approved designated housing plans on its website. Between 1974 and 1983, the Section 8 program provided rental assistance for developers creating housing for low-income families. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 allowed owners to establish a preference for elderly tenants in mixed population properties. Unlike Public Housing, most Section 8 properties cannot exclude residents with disabilities. Section 8 properties must reserve units for households with disabilities, even if there is a preference for elderly residents. Owners are required to set aside a certain number of units for disabled families or near elderly families with disabilities. The federal government's role in affordable housing decreased in the 1980s, leading to an increase in housing development at the state and local levels due to programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the HOME Investment Partnerships program. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and HOME Investment Partnerships program increased housing development at the state and local levels. LIHTC provides tax credits for affordable rental housing development, while HOME program distributes funds for affordable housing production. States may allocate funds for affordable housing for persons with disabilities. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is awarded by states to developers for affordable rental housing development. Developers can retain or sell the credits for financing. Projects must have at least 40% affordable units for households below 60% of the area median income. Rent for restricted units cannot exceed 30% of an imputed income limitation. States set criteria in their Qualified Allocation Plans for selecting projects to receive tax credits. States prioritize LIHTC projects serving lowest income tenants for longest period in their Qualified Allocation Plans. Special needs populations, such as individuals with disabilities, homeless individuals, and elderly individuals, are considered in setting housing priorities. States may allocate tax credits for special needs populations by requiring developers to reserve units, setting aside a percentage of credits, or awarding additional points in the competition. The HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME program) is a block grant distributed to states and local jurisdictions for developing affordable rental and homeowner housing. Funds are distributed based on factors like population, poverty levels, housing conditions, and age of housing. Funds can be used for building or rehabilitating housing, rental assistance, and homeowner assistance for low-income households. States and localities have discretion in using HOME funds similar to LIHTC funds. The HOME program is a block grant for affordable housing, distributed to states and local jurisdictions based on various factors. Recipients have discretion in choosing populations to serve and develop a plan for fund distribution. This is done through HUD's Consolidated Plan process, which includes an assessment of community needs and proposals to address them. States and communities must consult with citizens and organizations, including those serving persons with disabilities, in developing their plans. The HOME program allows jurisdictions to prioritize housing for persons with disabilities in their Consolidated Plans. Recipients can establish preferences for tenants with special needs, target rental assistance to individuals with specific disabilities, and develop various types of housing suitable for tenants with disabilities. The Community Development Block Grant program aims to fund housing and community development in urban areas. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, established in 1974, funds housing, community, and economic development activities benefiting low- and moderate-income households. 70% of funds go to entitlement communities, while 30% goes to states for small, non-entitlement communities. Allocation is based on factors like population, poverty, and housing conditions. The program must consider the needs of persons with disabilities and target resources accordingly. The Bush Administration's New Freedom Initiative and HUD guidance assist CDBG recipients in identifying and meeting the needs of persons with disabilities. CDBG funds can be used to rehabilitate housing and make public facilities accessible. Job training and employment counseling for persons with disabilities are valid uses of CDBG funds. Changes to the Section 811 program funding structure occurred in FY2011 due to the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010. The Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) brought changes to the Section 811 program, including funding for Section 811 rental assistance through the Section 8 account. Additionally, the Act introduced the Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program for Section 811 rental assistance only. In FY2012, no new funding was provided for Section 811 capital grants, with funds allocated for renewing rental assistance contracts and the PRA program instead. Financing affordable housing for low-income and special needs populations may require multiple funding sources, including federal funds from HUD programs, mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits, and local housing trust fund resources. Section 811 developers often need to combine various funding sources to support the design, construction, and operating costs of a project. In 2000, Congress enacted a law to facilitate the interaction between Section 811 funds and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) to help developers secure multiple financing sources. Congress enacted a law in 2000 to facilitate the interaction between Section 811 funds and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for developers. The law changed the definition of \"private nonprofit organization\" in the Section 811 statute to allow for-profit limited partnerships with a nonprofit organization as the sole general partner to be eligible Section 811 owners. This change allows nonprofit Section 811 grantees to loan their funds without reducing the value of LIHTCs. The law change in 2000 allowed for-profit limited partnerships with a nonprofit organization as the sole general partner to be eligible Section 811 owners. This change enables nonprofit Section 811 grantees to loan their funds without reducing the value of LIHTCs. Mixed financing arrangements involving Section 811 funds and LIHTCs are complex and require expertise in housing finance. HUD recognizes that developers generally prefer to avoid federal grant financing in LIHTC projects. The treatment of Section 811 PRAC in tax credit transactions remains unclear, as it has not been exempted from the rule that federal grants do not count toward the qualified basis of a property. Despite efforts to exempt certain programs from the requirement, Section 811 PRAC has not been excluded. The IRS has not issued a ruling to include Section 811 assistance in calculating qualified basis. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 removed limitations on developing mixed finance projects using Section 811 and LIHTC. Developers may qualify for tax credits under LIHTC law, with the higher credit available for new construction not federally subsidized. P.L. 110-289 removed the phrase \"below market federal loans\" from the definition of federal subsidy in the LIHTC statute, making all federally subsidized new construction eligible for 9% tax credits. Despite the competitive nature of the 9% credits, it may still be challenging for Section 811 developers to obtain them. Persons with disabilities have a need for affordable housing. HUD regularly releases reports on worst case housing needs for affordable housing in the United States. These needs are defined as very low-income renter households that do not receive rental assistance and either pay more than half their income towards rent or live in severely inadequate housing. Using data from the 2013 American Housing Survey, HUD found that 7.72 million households had worst case housing needs in 2015, a decrease of 9% compared to 2011. In 2013, 2.8 million very low-income rental households had a non-elderly member with a disability, with 39% of them experiencing worst-case housing needs. Homelessness in the US increased in the 1970s and 1980s due to various factors like the demolition of skid rows and decreased availability of affordable housing. In the early 2000s, attention was focused on homeless individuals experiencing \"chronic homelessness,\" with efforts to end it within 10 years. Chronically homeless individuals are defined as those with disabilities who have been homeless for long periods. The definition was refined in 2009 and again in 2015, stating that a person is chronically homeless if they have a disability and have been continuously homeless for 12 months. In 2015, HUD estimated that approximately 15% of the total homeless population were chronically homeless individuals and 2.3% were in chronically homeless families. Rates of mental health problems are estimated to exist in more than 60% of chronically homeless individuals, and more than 80% are estimated to have alcohol or drug problems. Medical problems, including HIV/AIDS, are also prevalent among chronically homeless individuals. \"Housing first\" is a strategy used to address chronic homelessness by providing permanent supportive housing before treating illnesses and addictions. HUD provides funds for the construction or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. HUD provides funds for the construction or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals, aiming to address their illnesses and addictions. Since 2001, HUD estimates that 108,000 beds in permanent supportive housing units have been funded, leading to a more than 30% decrease in the number of chronically homeless individuals between 2007 and 2015."
