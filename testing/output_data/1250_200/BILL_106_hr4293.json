    "content": "The Act titled \"Nursing Home Criminal Background Check Act of 2000\" inserts a new chapter in the United States Code for conducting criminal background checks in nursing homes. The Nursing Home Criminal Background Check Act of 2000 prohibits nursing facilities from employing individuals who have not passed a required criminal background check, with a fine of up to $5,000. The Act also mandates notification of this requirement to nursing facilities and the adoption of a criminal background check requirement for all employment applicants within 180 days. The Nursing Home Criminal Background Check Act of 2000 mandates that nursing facilities enforce a requirement for employment applicants to make a statement under section 1444, providing personal information and confirming no criminal history involving violence or controlled substances. The facility must transmit these statements to the Attorney General for background checks. The Attorney General determines if an applicant has criminal convictions related to violence or controlled substances. If no convictions are found within 5 business days, the applicant is considered to have passed the background check. Nursing facilities and applicants are not charged for the background check. Failure to hire based on background check results is a valid defense for the facility. Definitions for \"nursing facility\" and \"applicant\" are provided in this chapter, excluding individuals seeking contract employment or licensed professional roles. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS: Requires nursing facility administrators to meet criminal background check requirements under chapter 70 of title 18, United States Code for both Medicaid and Medicare. \n\nSEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Attorney General will conduct a study on background checks in nursing homes, reporting to Congress on the success and impact of these checks on patient care. The study will also assess the need for background checks in other settings and propose methods to improve the system and associated costs."
