    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002\" is also known as the Act. It provides incentives for the use of biodiesel as a fuel, including a tax credit for biodiesel used as fuel under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 offers a biodiesel fuels credit under section 38, equal to the biodiesel mixture credit. The biodiesel mixture credit is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified biodiesel mixture and the number of gallons of the mixture used by the taxpayer. The qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by a taxpayer in their trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the biodiesel fuels credit. The credit allowed under this section applies to casual off-farm production of a qualified biodiesel mixture. The amount of the credit for biodiesel is reduced to account for benefits from other tax exemptions. Biodiesel is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from various vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. The biodiesel tax credit applies to biodiesel made from rapeseeds, safflowers, flaxseeds, rice bran, and mustard seeds. The biodiesel must meet registration requirements set by the EPA and ASTM D6751. If biodiesel is used in a qualified mixture but then separated, the tax credit is imposed. The biodiesel tax credit is imposed if biodiesel is separated from a mixture or used in a way other than as fuel. All applicable laws and penalties apply to the tax. Estates and trusts follow pass-thru rules, and taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit. The taxpayer can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year before the 3-year period after the filing deadline. The section will not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2012, and the credit is treated as part of the general business credit. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003, and is included in the general business credit. Amendments were made to sections 39(d), 196(c), and 6501(m) of the Code. Amendments were made to section 40A for the biodiesel fuels credit, including changes to section 6501(m) of the Code. Amendments were made to section 40A for the biodiesel fuels credit, including changes to section 6501(m) of the Code. The amendments include a reduction of motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, with effective date for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002. The tax rate is reduced for biodiesel mixtures based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. Definitions from section 40A apply, and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply. Amendments were made to section 40A for biodiesel fuels credit, including changes to section 6501(m) of the Code. The tax rate for biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the biodiesel percentage. Amendments were made to sections 4041 and 6427 of the Code to accommodate qualified biodiesel mixtures. The amendments made to sections 4041 and 6427 of the Code reduce the tax rate for biodiesel mixtures based on the biodiesel percentage. Effective December 31, 2002, to January 1, 2013, fuel sold will be subject to the new rates. Transfers from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds will offset reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts due to these changes."
