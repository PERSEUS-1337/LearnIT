    "content": "In this work, a strategy for encoding curiosity algorithms as programs in a domain-specific language is proposed. The rich language of programs enables the expression of highly generalizable programs that perform well in various domains. Several pruning techniques are developed to make this approach feasible, including learning to predict a program's success based on its syntactic properties. Empirical results show that the approach discovers curiosity strategies competitive with those in published literature and generalizes well. Our RL agent is augmented with a curiosity module obtained through meta-learning over a complex space of programs to compute a pseudo-reward at each time step. Effective exploration and exploitation are crucial in reinforcement learning, especially in complex environments with large state and action spaces and sparse rewards. Researchers have focused on designing good exploration strategies, such as curiosity or intrinsic motivation, to induce the RL agent to explore effectively. The text discusses the challenge of designing reward signals to encourage exploration in reinforcement learning agents. Researchers struggle to hand-design effective strategies due to the vast space of environments. Drawing inspiration from natural curiosity in young beings, the text proposes a meta-learning approach to generate curious behavior by dynamically adapting the agent's reward signal. The text discusses a meta-learning approach to generate curious behavior in reinforcement learning agents by dynamically adapting the agent's reward signal. The inner loop performs standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal, while the outer \"evolutionary\" search aims to find a program for the curiosity module to optimize the agent's lifetime return or another global objective. The foundational methods for reinforcement learning are considered sound and serve as the behavior-learning basis for the agents. In a meta-learning setting, the objective is to find a curiosity module that performs well across a distribution of environments. Meta-RL has been explored to reduce the amount of experience needed and for efficient exploration in low-diversity environment distributions. In a meta-learning setting, the focus is on discovering curiosity mechanisms that can generalize across a broad distribution of environments, including image-based games and robotic control tasks. This paper introduces three novel contributions: meta-reinforcement-learning in vastly different environments, representation of curiosity strategies in a rich program space, and the use of a domain-specific language for program representation. The paper introduces meta-reinforcement-learning in diverse environments, representing curiosity strategies in a rich program space using a domain-specific language. This approach aims to discover general exploration methods through a search over programs, addressing the challenge of evaluating solutions in a combinatorial space efficiently. The approach addresses the challenge of evaluating solutions efficiently in diverse environments by using a domain-specific language to represent curiosity strategies in a rich program space. By including environments of different difficulty levels, predicting algorithm performance, and monitoring agent learning curves, the approach prunes unpromising programs early and discovers effective exploration methods. The agent learns a policy to maximize rewards using algorithm A, with a curiosity module C providing proxy rewards for exploration. The goal is to design C to maximize total rewards over time steps T. The overall goal is to design a curiosity module C that induces the agent to maximize rewards over time steps T. This triplet (environment, curiosity module, agent) acts as a dynamical system, with the objective of maximizing the expected original reward obtained by the composite system in the environment. Mathematics and algorithms play a crucial role in describing phenomena and powerful algorithms with concise descriptions. The text discusses the design of a curiosity module that guides an agent to maximize rewards over time steps by using general programs in a domain-specific language. The module is decomposed into two components: one that outputs an intrinsic reward value based on experienced transitions, and another that combines actual and intrinsic rewards to yield a proxy reward. The text discusses the design of a curiosity module that guides an agent to maximize rewards over time steps using general programs in a domain-specific language. It consists of two components: one outputs intrinsic reward based on experienced transitions, and the other combines actual and intrinsic rewards to yield a proxy reward. The programs are drawn from a basic class with a directed acyclic graph of modules with polymorphically typed inputs and outputs. The text discusses a curiosity module design for maximizing rewards using general programs in a domain-specific language. It includes functional, buffer, parameter, and update modules in a directed acyclic graph. The output node's output is considered the program output. The program propagates input and parameter values through functional modules, updating FIFO buffers and parameters via gradient descent. Differentiable operations allow gradient propagation, while non-differentiable operations like buffers and \"Detach\" prevent backpropagation. Multiple agents share a policy and curiosity module, executing reward predictions on batches. Neural network weight updates serve as memory, decrementing adjustable parameters based on the gradient of loss module outputs. The program updates adjustable parameters based on the gradient of loss module outputs to learn and make predictions. Various curiosity modules are represented, including inverse features, random network distillation, and ensemble predictive variance. Polymorphic data types play a key role in the program search. The program utilizes polymorphic data types for inputs and outputs, allowing for flexibility in module instantiation based on the environment. This abstraction enables curiosity modules to generalize across tasks with different input and output spaces, such as images or vectors, discrete or continuous actions. The program utilizes polymorphic data types for inputs and outputs, allowing for flexibility in module instantiation based on the environment. Curiosity modules generalize radically, applying to tasks with different input and output spaces. The RND program processes input through two NNs, updating weights to minimize loss and mimic randomly initialized NN output. The intrinsic reward decreases as the program predicts randomized NN output better. The program aims to predict the output of a randomly initialized NN, with decreasing intrinsic reward driving the agent to explore new states. To limit the search space, the computation graph is restricted to 7 modules. Strategies are explored to speed up the search process for effective curiosity programs across various environments. The program aims to predict the output of a randomly initialized NN with decreasing intrinsic reward driving exploration. Strategies are designed to quickly discard less promising programs and focus on more promising ones, inspired by AutoML efforts. Pruning efforts are divided into three categories: simple tests, filtering based on poor performance, and meta-meta-RL learning. Two heuristics are used to prune obviously bad programs, including checking for duplicates through a randomized test. The program aims to predict the output of a randomly initialized NN with decreasing intrinsic reward driving exploration. Strategies are designed to quickly discard less promising programs and focus on more promising ones. Pruning efforts involve simple tests, filtering based on poor performance, and meta-meta-RL learning. The current chunk discusses checking loss functions and optimizing neural networks to minimize variables independently of input data to find algorithms that perform well on various environments. The current chunk discusses the importance of trying many programs in cheap environments and only a few promising candidates in expensive environments to find general and robust solutions. The search process involves predicting program performance directly from program structure and bootstrapping an initial training set for selection. The search process involves predicting program performance from structure using a k-nearest neighbor regressor with an -greedy exploration policy. Results show that most top programs can be discovered by exploring only half of the program space. Additionally, algorithms can be pruned during the training process of the RL agent by using the top K current best programs as benchmarks. Our RL agent uses PPO based on the implementation in PyTorch. The code is designed to work with any OpenAI gym environment by specifying the desired exploration horizon. Each curiosity algorithm is evaluated for multiple trials with shared policy and curiosity modules. Curiosity predictions and updates are batched across multiple rollouts. In a search for a good intrinsic curiosity program, we use PPO with multiple rollouts and shared modules. Curiosity predictions are batched across rollouts, and policy updates are batched across rollouts and timesteps. The exploration environment is an image-based grid world where agents navigate in a 2D room. Programs with up to 7 operations are evaluated, resulting in about 52,000 programs split across 4 machines for optimization. Each machine aims to find the highest-scoring 625 programs. After splitting 52,000 programs across 4 machines with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs, each machine searches for the top 625 programs in its section of the search space for 10 hours. Programs with lower performance are pruned based on statistical significance. A 10-nearest-neighbor regressor predicts program performance, and a -greedy strategy is used to choose the next program to evaluate, prioritizing the best predicted programs early in the search. This approach allows for efficient exploration of the search space. Searching through the program space took 13 GPU days, with most programs performing poorly. The top 1% of programs were found to comprise roughly 0.5% of the entire space, with the highest scoring program being surprisingly simple, consisting of only 5 operations. This program, named Top, uses a neural network to predict actions and compare predictions, showing high performance. The program uses a neural network to predict actions and generate high intrinsic reward based on the difference between predictions from two states. The algorithm's simplicity suggests it may be novel. Performance in gridworld correlates with performance in more challenging environments like lunar lander and acrobot. The performance of intrinsic curiosity programs in gridworld, acrobot, and lunar lander environments is evaluated based on mean reward across learning episodes. Most programs that perform well in gridworld also excel in the other two environments. The top-performing programs are variations of a program called Top, with some incorporating different prediction methods. The reward combiner was developed in lunar lander based on the best program from a set of 16,000 programs. In evaluating intrinsic curiosity programs in gridworld, acrobot, and lunar lander environments, the best reward combiner was determined from a set of 16,000 programs. The selected programs were tested on lunar lander and acrobot, showing good correlation with performance in gridworld. Future work aims to co-adapt search for intrinsic reward programs and find multiple reward combiners. The study evaluated intrinsic curiosity programs in gridworld, acrobot, and lunar lander environments. The 16 best programs were tested on hopper and ant environments, showing significant performance improvements compared to constant rewards and equivalent to published algorithms. The study evaluated intrinsic curiosity programs in gridworld, acrobot, and lunar lander environments. The best 16 programs were compared to weak baselines and published algorithms, showing statistically equivalent performance to published work and significantly better than weak baselines. The programs were meta-trained on GridWorld and generalized well to other environments. Adding more metatraining tasks would involve standardizing performance and selecting programs with the best mean performance. The study evaluated intrinsic curiosity programs in various environments and found that meta-training on a single task led to great results, showcasing the generalization of program representations. This approach differs from neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization by aiming to generalize across multiple environments and search over various programs and loss functions. It draws inspiration from AutoML community's work in searching for programs in different domains. Our work utilizes neural networks as basic operations within larger algorithms, with optimization objectives specified by the algorithms themselves. This contrasts with meta-learning approaches that train neural modules' weights and transfer them to new tasks. Our work utilizes neural networks as basic operations within larger algorithms, with optimization objectives specified by the algorithms themselves. In contrast, there has been much interesting work in designing intrinsic curiosity algorithms, with inspiration taken from various sources to design a domain-specific language. The approach involves using neural network training as an implicit memory, scaling well to millions of time-steps, and incorporating buffers and nearest-neighbour regressors. The generated algorithms include novelty search and EX 2, but do not cover exploration algorithm classes focusing on generating goals, learning progress, diverse skills, stochastic neural networks, count-based exploration, and others. In contrast to previous work on intrinsic curiosity algorithms, recent research has focused on exploring diverse skills, stochastic neural networks, count-based exploration, and object-based curiosity measures. Some curiosity algorithms struggle to generalize to new environments, prompting efforts to improve generalization in meta-RL. Various approaches have been proposed, such as using LSTM to explore environments across episodes and incorporating structured noise for meaningful exploration. RL policies combine gradient-based meta-learning with a learned latent exploration space, adding structured noise for meaningful exploration. Unlike previous methods, this approach searches over algorithms to generalize broadly and consider exploration effects over a larger number of time-steps. Similar to evolved policy gradients, this method meta-learns a neural network to compute a loss function based on agent-environment interactions. The curr_chunk discusses the optimization of neural network weights through evolution strategies to generate new policies for achieving different goals.

The efficiency of meta-learning programs for generating curious exploration algorithms is emphasized, showcasing their power as a succinct representation. The curr_chunk discusses meta-learning programs for efficient exploration algorithms in reinforcement learning. The resulting algorithms prioritize generalization and reliability, with open-sourced code for further research. The approach of meta-learning programs has potential applications beyond curiosity algorithms, such as optimization algorithms. Different types of data are defined for each environment, with a distinction between real numbers and positive numbers in program search. The curr_chunk discusses meta-learning programs for optimization in reinforcement learning, focusing on state space, action space, feature-space, and list operations. It also mentions RunningNorm for input normalization and covers two other published algorithms in meta-RL. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of current meta-RL methods in transferring knowledge between tasks and environments. It mentions attempts to broaden generalization, such as transfer between Atari games and benchmarking with different levels of the game Sonic. Additionally, it highlights recent proposals for benchmarking multiple tasks and generating different terrains. The curr_chunk discusses optimizing search algorithms to find the best programs faster, showing that evaluating only 50% of programs can find 88% of the best ones. It also presents mean performance data for 26,000 evaluated programs across 5 trials. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of program means in a search algorithm, highlighting a small percentage of programs with statistically significant performance. It also showcases a top variant in a preliminary search on grid world and a good algorithm found through the search process."
