    "content": "In the mid-1990s, the primary threat posed by NBC weapons to the United States shifted from a U.S.-Russian strategic exchange to more numerous and unpredictable threats. The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to concerns about Russian WMD safety, while Iraq and North Korea's NBC weapons programs created new asymmetric challenges. Secretary of Defense William Cohen noted that American military superiority increased the risk of NBC attacks. Congress is worried about countries and groups with NBC weapons and missile delivery capabilities. The concern over countries and groups with NBC weapons, missile delivery systems, and state sponsors of terrorism with NBC weapons programs has increased since the September 2001 attacks. President Bush emphasized the threat of terrorism armed with WMDs, leading to a debate on the extent of the WMD threat and the slow changes in global stockpiles of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The debate over the WMD threat includes discussions on the status of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons worldwide. While some analysts highlight progress in arms control, others point out negative impacts such as nuclear and missile tests by certain countries, transfers of dangerous technology, and the interest in NBC weapons among terrorists. This report focuses on current threats and trends in NBC weapons and missiles, impacting U.S. security interests and national security decisions. The U.S. government has taken steps to address NBC weapons proliferation, including training for NBC environments, foreign policy towards countries of proliferation concern, and debates on threat character and defense strategies. The U.S. government has implemented various strategies to combat weapons of mass destruction proliferation, including counterproliferation efforts, strengthened nonproliferation measures, and consequence management. These strategies involve interdicting WMD materials, diplomatic efforts, and homeland defense against WMD threats. The spread of dangerous technology to additional countries and groups is facilitated by technological developments, free flow of information, growing disparities in military capabilities, prestige of nuclear and missile capabilities, perceived utility of NBC threats, and disdain for arms control agreements. Threat assessments are subjective and debateable due to the need to assess technical capabilities and intentions of states or groups possessing weapons. The connection between technology or weapons and the risk of use is not always clear. The risk of use of weapons of mass destruction is influenced by factors such as stockpiles, technology diffusion, and global tensions. Reduction of tension, economic and political integration, and strong deterrent capabilities can help deter proliferation. The debate over the effectiveness of a National Missile Defense system in deterring WMD proliferation continues. The threat of NBC weapons from terrorist groups is complex, as they may not adhere to traditional deterrence. President Bush acknowledged the challenge of states sponsoring terror seeking or possessing WMD. President Bush highlighted the threat posed by states sponsoring terror seeking or possessing weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing the potential for these weapons to fall into the hands of terrorists. The spread of nuclear weapons to additional states not only increases the risk of nuclear war but also raises the threat of nuclear terrorism. The connection between the proliferation of advanced weapons and technologies to rogue states, terrorists, and international crime organizations has long been recognized as a significant danger. The spread of nuclear weapons to additional states increases the risk of nuclear war and terrorism. Proliferating states' weapon programs offer opportunities for exploitation by terrorists. Nations seeking nuclear weapons and harboring terrorists pose a severe threat. Analysts debate whether rogue states plan to use WMD against the United States, with some doubting overt attacks due to potential counterattacks. However, NBC weapons could be used to limit U.S. military options as a last resort. The U.S. government works to decrease WMD use, spread, and vulnerability. U.S. leadership is critical for international nuclear agreements and agencies. The U.S. government's leadership is crucial for international nuclear agreements and agencies, working to decrease the spread of nuclear weapons and capabilities. However, some criticize recent U.S. actions for potentially stimulating WMD proliferation, such as developing a national missile defense and refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Critics fear that short-term goals in the war on terrorism may overshadow broader nonproliferation objectives. Observers abroad are concerned that the U.S. is abandoning arms control efforts. Critics fear that short-term goals in the war on terrorism may overshadow broader nonproliferation objectives. Observers abroad are concerned that the U.S. is abandoning arms control efforts, potentially leading to other states seeking the same freedom of action. Missile defense advocates argue that it strengthens deterrence and prevents rogue states from blackmailing the U.S. or its allies with missile threats. Around twenty-five countries are suspected of having NBC weapons programs or stockpiles, with some having missile capabilities. Most NBC weapons programs have been developed covertly, with nuclear and ballistic missile programs being more easily detectable than biological and chemical weapons programs. Some countries are actively building NBC weapon stockpiles and improving delivery capabilities using available missile technology. The intent and ultimate objectives of countries pursuing NBC weapons capability are not portrayed in the data. Some countries are actively building NBC weapon stockpiles and improving delivery capabilities using available missile technology. Five states are considered nuclear weapon states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT): China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Four other states\u2014India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea\u2014have nuclear weapons. China's nuclear arsenal is not publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to have over 100 nuclear warheads. Beijing has between 90-112 nuclear warheads deployed on various types of missiles, including ICBMs with the capability to reach the continental United States. China's nuclear arsenal includes solid-fueled, road-mobile DF-31 ICBM with a range of 7,250 km and one XIA-class ballistic-missile submarine with 12 launch tubes for JL-1 SLBM with a range of 1,700 km. The status of the submarine is unclear, but it is not deployed according to NASIC. ONI stated that the XIA likely constitutes a limited component of China's current nuclear deterrent force. The XIA-class ballistic-missile submarine with 12 launch tubes for JL-1 SLBM has limited utility as a deterrent platform, but can hit targets in the region from traditional Chinese Navy operating areas. Beijing may have around 40 nuclear bombs for delivery by aircraft, with an estimated 70 nuclear warheads in storage. France has approximately 350 nuclear warheads deployed on SLBMs and ALCMs, with plans to replace the M45 SLBM with the M51. Paris also has four ballistic missile submarines, each capable of carrying 16 4,000 km-range M45 SLBMs. France is developing the 6,000 km-range M51 SLBM to replace the M45, with each missile capable of holding up to six warheads. They also have a new class of ballistic submarines, with the last one set to come into service in 2010. France's nuclear warheads are carried on Air-Sol-Moyenne Port\u00e9e (ASMP) cruise missiles, with 50 assigned to Mirage 2000N and 10 to Super \u00c9tendard aircraft. Russia's strategic nuclear forces include various ICBMs and SLBMs, along with a bomber fleet consisting of 78 aircraft. They are estimated to have around 2,000-3,000 operational tactical warheads. Russia has approximately 2,000-3,000 operational tactical warheads and 8,000-10,000 stockpiled strategic and tactical warheads. Moscow's strategic forces are designed to deter aggression but are prepared for limited nuclear strikes. The UK has fewer than 160 operationally available nuclear warheads deployed on Vanguard-class submarines. They intend to reduce their reserve stockpile by 20%. The United Kingdom plans to reduce its reserve stockpile of nuclear warheads by 20% and may deploy only three submarines for its nuclear deterrent. They are participating in the U.S. Life Extension Program for the Trident missile. Israel, India, and Pakistan have also developed nuclear weapons, with Pakistan estimated to have around 60 warheads. Pakistan and India have nuclear warheads, with Pakistan having around 60 warheads and India between 36 and 100. North Korea has produced plutonium for nuclear weapons and tested one in 2006. They shut down plutonium facilities in 2007 and started a uranium enrichment program in 2000. Iran has been suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons, with new activities revealed by an IAEA investigation in 2002. Iran's nuclear activities, including centrifuge and laser enrichment, were revealed in 2002. In 2003, Iran agreed to enhanced inspections and suspended uranium enrichment in a deal with the EU-3. Despite renewing pledges in 2004, little progress was made in negotiations. In 2005, Iran was found in noncompliance with IAEA safeguards, leading to UN Security Council involvement in 2006. Sanctions were imposed through resolutions 1737 and 1747. The 2007 NIE stated Iran had a past nuclear weapons program but had halted it. The 2007 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) reported that Iran had a nuclear weapons program in the past but stopped it in 2003. The NIE also mentioned that Iran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007, but was keeping the option open. U.S. officials raised concerns about Syria's nuclear ambitions, with reports of Pakistani involvement in offering nuclear technology to Syria. The IAEA was investigating potential nuclear technology procurement networks involving Syria. Former National Security Council officials doubted the likelihood of a Syrian nuclear weapons program. The Khan network was involved in nuclear technology procurement. Some governments have given up nuclear weapons or programs. Despite controls by the NSG, nuclear technology is more accessible. Suggestions for further controls include bans on certain technologies and international management. The global nuclear warhead count is expected to decrease as the US and Russia reduce their arsenals. The global nuclear warhead count is expected to decrease as the US and Russia reduce their arsenals. China, India, and Pakistan may expand their nuclear inventories. North Korea has halted plutonium production. China is projected to modernize its nuclear arsenal with more survivable ballistic missiles. China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal with enhanced CSS-3s, CSS-4s, and CSS-5s, DF-31s, and the DF-31A. Beijing could increase its number of ICBM warheads capable of reaching the United States to well over 100. China is also developing new air- and ground-launched cruise missiles for nuclear missions, deploying a new SLBM, the JL-2, on a new JIN-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. The JL-2 is expected to have an estimated range of over 8,000 km and reach initial operational capability between 2007 and 2010. Russia is modernizing its nuclear arsenal with new missiles and submarines. Moscow's strategic nuclear forces are expected to decline in the next 10 years as it retires aging systems. Russia may deploy new missiles with multiple warheads and is developing a missile with a range of over 5,500 km. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1700-2200 strategic warheads. India and Pakistan are also intensifying their nuclear rivalry. India and Pakistan intensified their nuclear rivalry in 1998, with both countries establishing doctrine, tactics, and contingency plans for nuclear weapons. Concerns grew about the safety of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal in 2001 due to riots and ties to the Taliban. Tensions along the Line of Control in Kashmir in 2002 raised fears of a conventional crisis escalating into a nuclear exchange. The tense military deployments along the Line of Control in Kashmir raised concerns of a potential nuclear crisis due to terrorist organizations seeking fissile material for nuclear weapons. There is also a growing threat of terrorist groups using dirty bombs with radioactive material, as seen in past attempts by Chechen rebels and the Aum Shinrikyo cult. The increased incidents of individuals trying to buy or sell nuclear material pose a risk of terrorists learning how to acquire such materials. Several nations, including China, Cuba, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Taiwan, are believed to have biological weapons capabilities. Iraq and Libya had programs in the past but ended them. Al-Qa'ida also had a program before 2001. Concern has shifted to the potential for terrorist groups to acquire biological weapons. The concern over biological weapons has shifted to the prospect of terrorist acquisition. While some experts believe terrorist groups may struggle to obtain materials and knowledge for large-scale attacks, advancements in biotechnology could make it more accessible. Even small amounts of biological agents could cause significant casualties in densely populated areas, as demonstrated by past incidents like the anthrax-laden letters in 2001. The threat of biological warfare, demonstrated by the anthrax-laden letters in 2001, remains a significant concern due to the difficulty in detecting covert development of biological weapons. International trade in biological weapons material and technology is a worry, and as biotechnology advances, the threat may increase. Member countries under the Chemical Weapons Convention are required to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007, with Albania being the first to do so. Other states like India, Libya, Russia, South Korea, and the United States have declared possession of such weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) requires member countries to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007. Albania was the first country to destroy its declared chemical weapons. India, Libya, Russia, South Korea, and the United States have also declared possession of such weapons and pledged to destroy them by the deadline. However, doubts exist regarding their ability to meet the deadline due to technical and legal challenges. Twelve countries reported facilities for CW production and have committed to destroying or converting them to civilian use. The OPCW has confirmed the destruction of all declared CW production facilities. The CWC has likely reduced the number of countries with chemical weapons and the likelihood of their use. Verification has not detected any violations of the CWC, but some countries may still have CW programs as the Convention has not been aggressively implemented. Iran and China are suspected of maintaining CW programs. Several countries may still be developing or producing chemical weapons, with the ability to deliver them through various means such as aircraft, drones, and missiles. The availability of technology and materials internationally allows for the concealment of production facilities, increasing the possibility of more countries and groups developing chemical weapon capabilities. In 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used sarin nerve gas in a Tokyo subway attack, highlighting the challenges in effectively disseminating chemical agents. There is concern that terrorist groups may seek to acquire chemical weapons, potentially with assistance from state actors. The intelligence community assesses that terrorist groups may continue efforts to obtain chemical weapons, possibly with state support. Al-Qaida had a chemical weapons program pre-2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The effectiveness of the Chemical Weapons Convention in limiting production and stockpiles will impact the global chemical weapons threat. The CIA warns of dangerous trends in biotechnology and the development of new chemical and biological weapons. Some countries are becoming self-sufficient in producing these weapons. Countries are increasingly self-sufficient in producing chemical and biological weapons, using civilian applications to conceal production. Controlling exports of dual-use technology is challenging. States with these capabilities are acquiring advanced delivery systems like cruise and ballistic missiles. Terrorist groups and some countries have sought or sponsored these weapons. Most countries pursuing nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons also possess ballistic missiles. North Korea demonstrated potential intercontinental ballistic missile capability in 1998. North Korea has tested intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. They have about 500 Scuds and 100 Nodong missiles, and have exported missiles to the Middle East. Several countries like Israel, India, Pakistan, and Iran possess medium-range ballistic missiles and may be developing intermediate and long-range ballistic missiles. Russia, China, and North Korea have exported missiles and technology to other countries. Cruise missiles are widely distributed, with about 81 countries possessing them. Cruise missiles are widely distributed, with about 81 countries possessing them. Russia, Ukraine, and France have long-range, sophisticated cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The UK, Germany, and possibly China are developing cruise missiles at the MTCR limit. North Korea, China, and various groups in Russia have helped other countries design, test, and produce their own missiles. Iran, Libya, and Egypt have been identified as sources of missiles or missile production technology. The proliferation of cruise missiles is widespread, with 81 countries possessing them. Production technology for these missiles is becoming more accessible, with 18 countries currently producing them and 22 others developing manufacturing capabilities. Commercially available technologies, such as satellite-assisted guidance and unmanned aerial vehicles, are advancing rapidly. Despite the availability of technology, states are not inevitably driven towards acquiring NBC weapons and missiles. Political and economic factors play a significant role in incentivizing or disincentivizing states and terrorist organizations from developing or abandoning such weapons. The international environment for nonproliferation has been shaped by political and economic trends, leading to a decrease in the risk of nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks. Efforts such as nuclear weapon reductions, improved safeguarding, and cooperation with allies through initiatives like the G-8 Global Partnership and Proliferation Security Initiative have contributed to reducing the risk of nuclear war and proliferation. Russia poses a significant nuclear weapons threat with thousands of weapons and a military doctrine that includes the use of nuclear weapons. Russian organizations have provided WMD technology to hostile countries, and there is uncertainty about future U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear arms control agreements. China has taken steps to join nonproliferation treaties and agreements. China has joined various nonproliferation treaties and agreements, but is modernizing its nuclear missile force and maintains chemical and possibly biological weapon stocks. It also provides missile technology to several countries and has a threatening stance towards Taiwan. International efforts in the 1990s included the indefinite extension of the NPT, the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the creation of the MTCR to control missile technology. The Chemical Weapons Convention also entered into force in 1997. The MTCR was created in 1987 to control missile technology, and the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in 1997. Despite these efforts, the future of multilateral arms control looks bleak, with no plans for the US to ratify the CTBT or create a verification protocol under the BWC. John Negroponte highlighted the challenges of tracking dual-use technologies and materials for weapons production, especially by states, terrorist groups like al-Qa'ida, and criminal organizations. U.S. intelligence officials have expressed concern about the proliferation of NBC weapons-related technology by countries like North Korea, China, and Russia, as well as a second tier of suppliers. The assistance of proliferators could enable a wider range of countries to develop nuclear weapons, bypassing the incremental pace of weapons programs. Non-state actors may also continue to play a significant role in this proliferation. Non-state actors are increasingly capable of providing WMD materials and technology, challenging our ability to monitor proliferation. The risk of nuclear weapons use can be estimated based on factors like weapon readiness, conflict levels, and strategic doctrines of nuclear-armed states. The Khan network may have been damaged, but similar networks could emerge. The risk of nuclear warfare increases as more countries acquire nuclear weapons or expand their arsenals. Factors such as inadequate command and control systems, vague strategic doctrines, and poor intelligence on enemy capabilities could heighten the risk. Key events since the development of nuclear weapons have been used to assess this risk, with analysts noting peaks in the early 1950s and during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Tensions remained high through the 1960s and the early 1980s saw renewed risks of confrontation between the US and USSR. The risk of nuclear warfare has increased with more countries acquiring nuclear weapons. Tensions peaked during the Cuban Missile Crisis and remained high in the 1960s. The early 1980s saw renewed risks of US-USSR confrontation, but Gorbachev's policies reduced the risk. New risks have emerged in the Middle East, South Asia, and the Korean Peninsula. The clash in Kargil and Indian-Pakistani tensions pose the greatest risk of nuclear war since the Cold War. Some experts believe the threat of nuclear war has decreased, but concerns remain about the potential use of nuclear weapons in regional conflicts. Some countries are considering using nuclear weapons in regional conflicts, raising concerns about the risk of nuclear war. The tense situation in Kashmir has sparked fears of a nuclear war in South Asia. There is debate about the potential for smaller, more targeted nuclear attacks and the destabilizing effects of advancements in nuclear weapon technology. The potential for smaller, more targeted nuclear attacks and advancements in nuclear weapon technology are seen as destabilizing, especially in light of recent criticism of leaks surrounding the new U.S. Nuclear Posture Review. A resumption of nuclear testing would also be viewed as potentially destabilizing."
