The Act allows a 30% tax credit for qualified wind energy property expenditures made by individuals. The credit is limited to $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity and requires property to meet safety certifications. Unused credits can be carried forward to the next taxable year. Qualified wind energy property expenditure is defined as an expenditure for wind energy property installed on a dwelling unit in the US used as a residence by the taxpayer, including installation fees. The property must be a qualifying wind turbine with a 5-year limited warranty. Expenditures for labor costs related to the onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of qualified wind energy property, including piping or wiring for connection to the dwelling unit or energy grid, are eligible under this section. A qualifying wind turbine is defined as a turbine with a rated capacity of 75 kilowatts or less, meeting performance standards at the time of manufacture, and used for electricity generation. Labor costs for installation are included in the qualified wind energy property expenditure. Expenditures related to energy storage mediums like swimming pools are not considered for this section. Special rules apply for joint occupancy dwelling units, treating all occupants as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining the allowable credit. Taxpayers can claim a credit for energy-related expenditures in the taxable year. Tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations are considered to have made a share of the corporation's expenditures. Individuals in condominiums are also eligible for the credit. Individuals who are members of a condominium management association owning a condominium are treated as having made their share of the association's expenditures. The term 'condominium management association' refers to an organization meeting specific requirements with units used as residences. If less than 80 percent of a qualified wind energy property is used for nonbusiness purposes, only that portion of expenditures for the property is eligible for credit. For qualified wind energy property, expenditures are allocated for nonbusiness purposes and energy generation for sale. Expenditures are considered made when the property is installed and begins generating energy. The cost of the expenditure is the amount taken into account. The taxpayer's expenditures for qualified wind energy property are subject to basis adjustments and a credit reduction. The section does not apply to property installed after December 31, 2008. The credit can be used against regular tax and alternative minimum tax. The tax credit for qualified wind energy property is subject to limitations based on the amount of tax.
