The virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses, with origins unknown. It is now spreading from human to human, with investigations ongoing into the role of swine in its emergence. The novel influenza virus, known as H1N1, emerged in April 2009 and is now being transmitted from human to human. The virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. It is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza. The virus has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic, but its virulence is still uncertain. In April 2009, cases were reported in California and Texas, with gene segments from swine flu viruses found in infected individuals who had no contact with pigs. Mexico also reported cases of the new influenza strain, prompting school closures and public event cancellations. In April 2009, a new strain of influenza, H1N1, emerged and spread from human to human. The Mexican government closed schools and canceled public gatherings due to over 1,000 suspected cases. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5, indicating imminent global spread of the virus. On June 11, 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the spread of the H1N1 virus. By June 22, 2009, over 50,000 human cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in more than 80 countries, with 231 deaths reported. It is important to note that more cases may have occurred than officially reported. WHO, FAO, and OIE confirmed that there is no risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked pork products. WHO advises against travel restrictions to stop the spread of H1N1 virus, but recommends ill individuals to delay international travel. Most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Some antiviral drugs can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness and death. Older antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness against H1N1, while oseltamivir and zanamivir are more effective. WHO maintains a global stockpile of antiviral drugs for treatment. WHO has been maintaining a global stockpile of approximately 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir for H1N1, with plans to distribute 3 million courses to developing countries in need. There is no available vaccine for H1N1 currently, but efforts are underway to develop one, which could take five to six months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Most countries have followed WHO recommendations against banning international travel, except for China which quarantined Mexican nationals. Some countries have advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico but later downgraded the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico, but later downgraded the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, citing the strain of the virus present throughout the United States. Some countries are installing thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Several countries are taking actions to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals. Several countries have taken measures to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, including Egypt ordering the slaughter of pigs. The United States has established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian aid for H1N1 outbreaks, providing over $16 million to assist Latin American and Caribbean countries. Aid efforts focus on H1N1 specifically and build on previous pandemic preparedness initiatives. The CDC, USAID, and Department of Defense are involved in global response efforts. Foreign assistance efforts for H1N1 outbreaks are primarily led by CDC and USAID, with some support from the Department of Defense. USAID donated PPE kits and disinfectant to Vietnam to aid in response efforts. CDC, as a WHO collaborating center, receives viral samples for influenza testing and provides testing kits to public health laboratories worldwide at no cost. The CDC sends testing kits to global influenza centers, deploys experts to strengthen lab capacity, and distributes treatment courses to Mexico. The Administration plans to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala to assist with various expertise in controlling virus spread. Teams collaborate with WHO/PAHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to understand illness severity and transmission. The CDC collaborates with global teams to understand H1N1 transmission patterns and improve laboratory capacity in Mexico. USAID provides funding for international H1N1 response efforts, with a focus on advanced disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, including support for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and Latin America. They distributed over 100,000 PPE kits to first responders in the region and pre-positioned 400,000 kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. Additionally, USAID conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia with stakeholders from nine East African countries. Participants from nine East African countries, including civilian and military representatives, met to develop a pandemic response action plan and test existing ones through simulation exercises. The exercises aimed to prepare governments for potential influenza pandemics and address cross-border population movements. USAID plans to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia, working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries. The Department of Defense (DOD) and its Pacific and African combatant commands\u2014PACOM and AFRICOM\u2014are providing military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness during a pandemic. USAID conducted joint pandemic preparedness exercises with military representatives from 27 African and Asian countries. Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic preparedness, with the United States pledging $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005. Since FY2005, the United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making up 30.9% of international donor pledges. The funds have supported efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The money was allocated for bilateral activities, support to international organizations, regional programs, global contingency, and technical assistance. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005. The funds support preparedness, surveillance, and response in over 100 nations. Contributions include detection sites, international assistance, research, stockpiles of supplies, and global communications. The pledge breakdown by agency is as follows: USAID: $542 million, HHS: $353 million, USDA: $37 million, DOD: $10 million, DOS: $7 million. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, with funds supporting preparedness, surveillance, and response in over 100 nations. President Obama requested $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness, with $50 million allocated for USAID and $200 million for CDC for H1N1 activities. Concerns about infectious diseases threatening global security have been heightened by outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza, SARS, and influenza A H1N1. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has raised concerns about global security due to infectious diseases originating from animals. Investments have been made to prepare for pandemics and monitor disease spread, with progress in developing tests and treatments for H1N1. However, challenges remain in ensuring all countries can effectively monitor and respond to the disease. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries' capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1. Transmission of influenza viruses tends to accelerate in winter months, with countries in the Southern hemisphere beginning to report cases. Questions remain about potential gene reassortment, especially in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu. Debate in May 2009 centered on whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system or develop an alert system based on severity. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, despite concerns about causing panic and economic disruptions. The update included a new pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, emphasizing the need for governments to plan and prepare for epidemics. USAID also recognized the threat of infectious diseases, particularly those originating in animals. USAID announced in April 2009 a new five-year program to address emerging pandemic threats in collaboration with CDC and USDA. The program aims to establish a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans, like SARS and H5N1. Funds will be used to set up a network of laboratories in Africa to improve pathogen diagnosis. Concerns exist about the limited cases of H1N1 in sub-Saharan Africa due to poor laboratory and surveillance systems. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of South Africa and Botswana, are in poor condition. Limited public health and surveillance capacity in most African countries hinders accurate disease reporting. Efforts by CDC, USAID, and other international health experts aim to strengthen these systems. CDC has distributed H1N1 testing kits to laboratories worldwide, including 18 in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poorer countries remains a contentious issue, highlighted during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. At the peak of global H5N1 avian flu outbreaks, Indonesia raised concerns about access to vaccines for poorer countries. USAID estimates that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines. WHO reports that over 90% of global influenza vaccine capacity is in Europe and North America. Concerns persist that richer countries may hoard treatments during a pandemic, leaving poorer countries reliant on donor generosity. WHO also questions the capacity of poorer countries to administer mass vaccination campaigns effectively. WHO reported that national authorities, not WHO, would conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns if a vaccine is developed. Concerns include the capacity of poorer countries to administer routine vaccines and the potential reassortment of H5N1 and H1N1 flu strains. This could create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Concerns about the potential for H5N1 to cause a pandemic arose in 2004 when human cases were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. By 2006, H5N1 outbreaks had affected multiple countries, with about 50 countries worldwide confirming cases. The virus is highly pathogenic and kills about 60% of humans infected, but it is not easily transmissible. Health experts are monitoring for potential H1N1 cases in countries with ongoing H5N1 outbreaks. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly than H1N1, killing about 60% of infected humans. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds, while animals are not a source of transmission for H1N1. Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases."
