    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions, prohibiting discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. Schools can be held liable for damages for a deliberately indifferent response to such incidents, whether committed by teachers or students. Enforcement of Title IX includes private rights of action against schools in certain circumstances. Title IX is enforced through private rights of action against schools and federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. Compliance with Title IX is a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program. It applies to all levels of federally-funded schools, requiring them to designate a Title IX Coordinator. The statute does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, but schools must address these issues. The Department of Education has issued guidance documents instructing schools on their responsibilities under Title IX for addressing sexual harassment allegations. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to such allegations. Recently, the Department of Education proposed new regulations that would significantly change how schools respond to sexual harassment. This report provides background on the legal landscape informing the proposal. Federal courts have interpreted Title IX in cases where students sue educational institutions for damages due to sexual abuse or harassment. The report also discusses how federal agencies, particularly the Department of Education (ED), enforce Title IX through guidance documents for schools on responding to sexual harassment and assault. It further explores constitutional challenges by students against public universities for violating due process rights in handling harassment allegations. Additionally, the report analyzes ED's proposed regulations that would change schools' responsibilities in complying with Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs, but does not explicitly allow for a private right of action for victims. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims of sexual harassment or abuse to seek relief under Title IX. The Supreme Court has recognized a judicially implied private right of action and damages remedy against federally funded educational institutions for sexual harassment. The Supreme Court has established a legal standard for liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment in federally funded educational institutions. This standard, based on the \"deliberate indifference\" standard from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, sets a high bar for plaintiffs to recover damages. Liability under Title IX is not automatic for an institution when sexual harassment or abuse occurs; instead, it depends on the institution's response to the conduct once they have knowledge of it. Title IX liability is based on the recipient's response to actual knowledge of harassment or abuse, requiring a showing of \"deliberate indifference.\" A private right of action allows for legal remedies for victims, while administrative enforcement focuses on institutional policies. Supreme Court decisions like Gebser v. Lago Vista and Davis v. Monroe County set out the requirements for liability under Title IX for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment. The Supreme Court's liability standard for Title IX in cases of sexual abuse or harassment is based on the institution's \"deliberate indifference\" to known misconduct. Liability is not automatic for a school or program, but rather depends on their response to actual knowledge of discrimination. The institution must be found to have failed to act adequately in response to the misconduct in order to be held liable. Title IX liability is based on the institution's failure to act adequately in response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. The Supreme Court's standard of deliberate indifference is used to determine liability, with a focus on the institution's response to discrimination. The Court looked to the statute's administrative enforcement provision for clues on legislative intent regarding Title IX liability. The Supreme Court ruled that liability under Title IX is based on an institution's inadequate response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. Deliberate indifference is the standard used to determine liability, requiring an actual notice to an appropriate person and a deficient response amounting to deliberate indifference. This parallels the standard of deliberate indifference in cases under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court ruled that under Title IX, liability is based on an institution's inadequate response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. Deliberate indifference is the standard for determining liability, requiring actual notice and a response amounting to deliberate indifference. This standard is not a mere reasonableness standard, but requires a clearly unreasonable response in light of the circumstances. A funding recipient is not liable under Title IX if its response to sexual abuse or harassment is not clearly unreasonable. To prevail in a Title IX suit for damages, a plaintiff must establish threshold showings before and after proving deliberate indifference. Before proving deliberate indifference, the plaintiff must show that an appropriate person at the funding recipient had actual knowledge of discrimination. Failure to demonstrate this may result in the dismissal of a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual harassment or abuse. The court's dismissal of a Title IX claim seeking damages for sexual harassment or abuse requires a plaintiff to establish that an \"appropriate person\" had actual knowledge of discrimination. The liability standard also requires showing that the funding recipient exercised \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the context of the harassment. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, leading to a denial of educational access. Davis limits a school's liability to circumstances where the harasser is under the school's control. The funding recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference to sexual harassment if the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority. The harassment must occur in a context subject to the school's control, be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, leading to a denial of educational access. The nature of the harassment depends on surrounding circumstances, including the ages of the individuals involved. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school will be liable under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment only if it acted with \"deliberate indifference\" in response to known discrimination. Harassment must have a systemic effect of denying the victim equal access to education, and evidence of a decline in grades can support a link between education and harassment. A single instance of harassment, even if severe, may not have a systemic effect. Lower federal courts have varied in their interpretations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment of a student. Some courts focus on a \"hostile environment\" analysis, while others look at elements such as actual notice of discrimination and deliberate indifference by the funding recipient. Additionally, courts require proof of certain elements when a Title IX claim involves student-to-student harassment or assault. Courts have varied in interpreting evidence for Title IX claims related to student sexual abuse or harassment. Elements required for student-to-student harassment claims include proving severity, denial of equal access, and substantial control by the recipient. Failure to satisfy any element can lead to claim dismissal. Gebser requires \"actual\" notice of discrimination, not just reasonable knowledge. The standard for \"actual\" notice is debated, with questions on what type of allegations give rise to it. Federal courts differ on the concept of \"actual notice\" in Title IX cases involving student sexual abuse or harassment. The Eleventh Circuit case of Doe v. School Board of Broward County questioned whether complaints from two students about the same teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of the teacher's sexual assault of a third student. The interpretation of \"actual notice\" is crucial as it determines whether a claim can proceed or be dismissed altogether. The court held that complaints from two students about the same teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of sexual assault of a third student. The reports alleged multiple instances of the teacher's sexual propositions, touching, and comments about their bodies, raising a triable issue of actual notice of harassment. In contrast, in Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that the school principal had no actual notice of a sixth-grade teacher sexually abusing a student, despite prior reports of molestation. The court dismissed the Title IX claim as there was no evidence that the principal was aware of the abuse of the plaintiff student, despite warnings from former students and teachers about the teacher's inappropriate behavior. The court dismissed the Title IX claim due to lack of evidence that the principal had actual notice of the abuse of the plaintiff student. Courts vary in defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability, requiring notice to an official with authority to address discrimination. Federal appellate case law focuses on whether the individual had the ability to address misconduct or held a representative position within the funding recipient. Federal courts have varying interpretations of who may constitute an \"appropriate person\" in cases of discrimination within educational institutions. Some courts have held that a public school principal may be considered an \"appropriate person\" based on their authority to address misconduct and initiate corrective action. The Fourth Circuit ruled in Baynard v. Malone that a principal is not an \"appropriate person\" to address teacher misconduct as they lack the authority to hire, fire, transfer, or suspend teachers. The Fifth Circuit also held in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person.\" The Fifth Circuit ruled that a vice principal, later principal, who sexually abused a student did not have corrective authority to address the harassment. They rejected the argument that the abuse should be treated as an official action of the school district for Title IX liability. Federal courts have analyzed whether university employees are \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX private actions. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a vice principal, later principal, who sexually abused a student did not have corrective authority to address the harassment. Federal courts have analyzed whether university employees are \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX private actions, considering factors like ranking in the university hierarchy and ability to halt misconduct. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, campus security officers were not deemed \"appropriate persons\" despite mandatory reporting of sexual assaults, as it was seen as a clerical act rather than corrective action. The determination of who may constitute an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX private actions varies among courts, with characteristics and responsibilities within the institution being key factors. To establish liability, a plaintiff must prove \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" and deliberate indifference in the entity's response, requiring more than mere negligence or failure to act reasonably. Courts interpret the standard under Title IX to require more than negligence or failure to act reasonably. Liability is established when there is \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" and deliberate indifference in the entity's response. Evidence of deliberate indifference includes a lack of response to reports of sexual harassment or abuse, such as failure to investigate or take disciplinary actions. Federal case law shows varying analyses on what constitutes a deficient response. Federal case law reflects divergent analyses on whether a response amounts to deliberate indifference. In a specific case, despite evidence of a deficient response to sexual abuse allegations against a teacher, the court did not find deliberate indifference by the school district. The plaintiffs alleged the teacher abused students for years, but the principal failed to act appropriately, leading to varying interpretations of deliberate indifference. The court found that the school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct did not amount to deliberate indifference. Despite receiving complaints from students, the principal took some actions such as interviewing the student and warning the teacher. In contrast, in a similar case, the court ruled that a school's response was deliberately indifferent when the principal failed to take adequate action after receiving multiple complaints about the same teacher. The principal's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was deemed inadequate by the court. Despite being aware of a possible pattern, the principal only obtained written statements from the student and teacher. This response, which failed to address previous complaints about the same teacher, was considered to be deliberate indifference. Some courts have addressed similar cases where deliberate indifference was found in the school's response to sexual misconduct allegations. In Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit addressed allegations of deliberate indifference by the university in failing to provide adequate training or guidance despite prior knowledge of sexual assaults during football recruitment. The university's coaching staff had ongoing awareness of such incidents, including a previous rape case involving a football player. The court highlighted the need for changes and training in response to these issues. The court emphasized that the evidence showed the head coach had knowledge of sexual assaults during football recruiting visits, yet failed to make changes to prevent such incidents. The university maintained an unsupervised player-host program, creating a triable issue of deliberate indifference under Title IX. Title IX is enforced by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs, with the ultimate sanction being termination or suspension of federal funds for violations. Agencies issue regulations and orders to enforce the statute and monitor compliance with Title IX. The Secretary of Education and the Attorney General play key roles in enforcing Title IX, with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborating to enforce the statute against recipients of federal financial assistance for educational programs. The OCR has primary responsibility for enforcing Title IX against recipients of financial assistance from ED. Regulations bar educational institutions from sex-based discrimination and require the designation of a Title IX Coordinator. OCR may conduct reviews or investigations to ensure compliance. OCR enforces Title IX by conducting reviews and investigations to ensure compliance with regulations against sex-based discrimination. Complaints alleging prohibited actions are investigated, and if violations are found, informal resolution through a resolution agreement is sought. If negotiations fail, formal enforcement measures, such as suspending or terminating funding, may be taken. ED's OCR issues guidance documents interpreting Title IX to include sexual harassment, with distinct responsibilities for educational institutions. The ED applies a constructive notice requirement for schools' Title IX liability for harassment, different from Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse. Schools must respond to harassment under Title IX based on baseline standards set by ED, even if the response is not \"clearly unreasonable.\" While the Supreme Court rejected vicarious liability for schools, ED holds them responsible for sexual harassment by teachers. OCR's 1997 guidance states that sexual harassment of students by school employees, students, or third parties is sex discrimination under Title IX. Sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, or third parties is prohibited by Title IX. There are two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. In the former, a school can be liable for harassment by an employee in a position of authority. In the latter, a school can be liable for creating a hostile or abusive educational environment due to harassment by employees. The 1997 Guidance explained that schools can be liable for harassment by employees if they acted with apparent authority or were aided in carrying out the harassment. For sexual harassment by other students or third parties, schools can be liable if a hostile environment exists, the school knew or should have known of the harassment, and the school fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Title IX holds schools responsible for their own discrimination in failing to remedy harassment once they have notice. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in Gebser that a school district is liable for harassment by a teacher only if it has actual knowledge of allegations and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis the next year, it was established that for damages in cases of sexual harassment by a student, the conduct must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, denying equal access to educational opportunities. The Court distinguished between actions leading to Title IX liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. Agencies have the authority to enforce Title IX mandates, even if they do not define them. According to the Supreme Court decisions in Gebser and Davis, schools can be held liable for sexual harassment under Title IX only if they have actual knowledge and respond with deliberate indifference. Federal agencies have the authority to enforce Title IX mandates, even if they do not define them. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations is distinct from the standards in administrative enforcement. The OCR issued a Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document in 2001, reaffirming the standards for responding to sexual harassment allegations under Title IX. Schools must have grievance procedures for resolving complaints promptly and equitably to comply with Title IX. Failure to do so results in a violation of Title IX. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX states that schools must take prompt and effective action to address sexual harassment to comply with the law. The guidance emphasizes the importance of ending harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying its effects. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX emphasizes the importance of schools addressing sexual harassment promptly and effectively. It explains that harassment that limits or denies a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program based on sex triggers the school's responsibilities under Title IX. The guidance outlines two types of harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment, with the latter requiring further investigation to determine if it is serious enough to discriminate based on sex. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX highlights the importance of schools addressing sexual harassment promptly and effectively. It distinguishes between quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment, with the latter requiring investigation to determine if it limits a student's ability to benefit from the school's program based on sex. In cases of student-on-student harassment, it is generally considered hostile environment harassment. The extent of a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or employees depends on whether it occurs within the context of their job responsibilities. In cases of sexual harassment within a school setting, whether by employees or students, the school is responsible for addressing and stopping the behavior, regardless of whether it occurs within the scope of an employee's job responsibilities. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX emphasizes the need to prevent and remedy harassment that limits a student's ability to benefit from the school's program. In cases of sexual harassment within a school setting, the school has a duty to stop the behavior and prevent its recurrence, creating a hostile environment. The school is responsible for eliminating the environment and taking prompt and effective action to correct the situation. If the school fails to do so, it is in violation of Title IX. The 2001 Guidance explains that recipients have notice of a sexually hostile environment if a responsible school employee knew or should have known of the harassment. A responsible school employee must take action to address harassment and report it to appropriate officials. The school is in violation of Title IX if it fails to promptly correct a hostile environment. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate and end harassment, prevent its recurrence, and eliminate a hostile environment. The school must promptly investigate reports of harassment and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation, including ending any harassment, eliminating a hostile environment, and preventing future harassment. Informal mechanisms may be used to resolve complaints if agreed upon by all parties, but certain procedures like mediation are not appropriate for cases like alleged sexual assault. Title IX rights should be interpreted in line with federal due process rights. The 2011 OCR Dear Colleague Letter supplemented the 2001 Guidance on Title IX obligations for schools regarding peer-to-peer harassment. It defined sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual violence. Sexual harassment creates a hostile environment if it interferes with a student's participation in the school's program. Due process rights should not unnecessarily delay Title IX protections for the complainant. Title IX requires schools to take immediate action to address student-on-student harassment that creates a hostile environment. Schools must also respond to incidents of sexual harassment off-campus and process complaints according to established procedures. When evaluating a hostile environment on campus, schools should consider the effects of off-campus conduct. Criminal investigations into sexual harassment allegations have different standards of liability than Title IX. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized that schools must conduct a Title IX investigation regardless of a criminal investigation into sexual violence allegations. Schools should not delay their own investigation and must use a preponderance of the evidence standard for grievance procedures to ensure prompt and equitable resolution of complaints. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the need for schools to use a preponderance of the evidence standard in their grievance procedures for Title IX investigations. Additionally, a supplemental Questions and Answers document was issued in 2014 to provide further guidance on handling allegations of student-on-student sexual violence. The 2014 Q&A provided specific instructions to schools on their obligations under Title IX regarding student-on-student sexual violence. It clarified that schools must promptly investigate allegations and take effective steps to end the violence, eliminate a hostile environment, prevent recurrence, and remedy its effects. The 2014 Q&A provided detailed instructions on Title IX obligations for schools regarding student-on-student sexual violence, including the need to promptly investigate allegations, protect complainants, and ensure safety through interim steps. It outlined requirements for Title IX Coordinators, written grievance procedures, responsible employees, and conducting investigations. The document emphasized that sanctions alone may not be sufficient to eliminate a hostile environment and prevent recurrence. The 2014 Q&A emphasized the need for schools to conduct Title IX investigations into student-on-student sexual violence, even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. It stated that sanctions alone may not be enough to prevent recurrence and eliminate a hostile environment. The document discouraged personal cross-examination and suggested using a trained third party to ask questions on behalf of parties. Between 2011 and 2016, schools developed procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX in response to increased oversight from OCR. These procedures varied across educational institutions, with ED having discretion in enforcement but constrained by due process protections for state actors. Public universities faced challenges in providing procedural protections to accused students. In the public university context, students challenged disciplinary procedures as unconstitutional, particularly in Title IX cases, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause. The Clause requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property, including \"property interests\" not created by the Constitution but arising from state or federal law. In cases involving government-created benefits or deprivation of liberty, individuals must show a legitimate entitlement originating from state or federal law. Due process is required when an individual's reputation or legal status is at stake. Courts consider factors like private interest, risk of error, and government interest when determining the procedures due. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of due process in cases involving government benefits or deprivation of liberty. Factors such as private interest, risk of error, and government interest are considered in determining the procedures due. The severity of the deprivation is a key factor in deciding the required procedures, with a stronger private interest necessitating more formal procedures. The case of Goss v. Lopez focused on procedural due process in student discipline, where high school students challenged their suspension without a hearing. In Goss v. Lopez, high school students challenged their suspension without a hearing. The Supreme Court ruled that public school students have a legitimate entitlement to education, protected by due process. Students facing suspension must be given notice and a hearing, with more formal procedures for longer suspensions or expulsions. Public universities must comply with constitutional standards, while private universities do not. Students of public universities may have a constitutionally protectable property right in their enrollment. Several federal courts have ruled that students in public universities have liberty and property interests in their education, with expulsion and suspensions potentially depriving them of these interests. Due process requires schools to provide notice of charges, evidence, and a fair hearing. Colleges have varied procedures to address allegations of sexual harassment, which have been challenged in court by students asserting due process rights. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Courts have considered claims such as inadequate notice of charges, lack of opportunity to confront witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. Some rulings have focused on whether a student's claim is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, without making final determinations on due process violations. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Courts have considered claims such as inadequate notice of charges, lack of opportunity to confront witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. One type of legal challenge raised by students accused of sexual misconduct is the failure of public universities to adequately notify them of the charges. The absence of proper notice can lead to a viable due process claim, as seen in a case where a student was suspended for three years without being properly informed of the allegations against him. A federal district court ruled that a student's three-year suspension without proper notice could be a due process violation. In another case, a student was expelled for sexual misconduct without being adequately informed of the charges against him, leading to a prejudiced defense. The court concluded that the university deprived the student of a fair process. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit found a due process violation when a university failed to provide evidence in a sexual assault case. The court ruled that a university violated due process by not providing evidence used in a disciplinary decision against a student accused of sexual assault. This failure to disclose evidence was deemed a constitutional violation, highlighting the importance of students' rights in disciplinary proceedings. Courts have been more willing to entertain due process claims in university adjudicatory proceedings when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility. Cross-examination is not always considered necessary in civil cases, and the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. Recent cases have seen due process challenges in sexual harassment allegations, where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine witnesses. Despite this, courts have rejected due process challenges in some instances, such as when accused students were only permitted to submit written questions to a panel chair. The reviewing district court rejected a due process challenge to university disciplinary proceedings where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine their accuser. The Sixth Circuit also denied a due process challenge in a similar case, stating that the limited cross-examination satisfied the requirements. The Fifth Circuit rejected a due process challenge where students argued they were denied effective cross-examination, noting that the decision was based on videos and photos rather than testimonial evidence. The court ruled in favor of due process challenges when credibility determinations were critical to the outcome of a proceeding. For example, a university violated due process by not allowing any form of cross-examination in a hearing where the disciplinary decision relied solely on a credibility determination based on hearsay. The court emphasized the importance of providing a method for the adjudicative body to assess the demeanor of both the accused and the accuser to comply with due process. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the adjudicative body to assess the demeanor of both the accused and the accuser to comply with due process. A federal district court ordered a university to provide a live hearing for an accused student facing expulsion to ensure due process, as the university's procedures lacked transparency in questioning and determining culpability. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in cases where credibility is at issue, universities must provide a fair process. The court found that the university violated the accused student's due process rights by not allowing cross-examination in a case where credibility was at issue. The Sixth Circuit emphasized the importance of giving the accused a chance to confront their accuser and adverse witnesses before a neutral fact-finder. Some students have also claimed they were denied the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence in their defense, with courts examining such claims on a case-by-case basis. Courts review claims of denial of presenting exculpatory evidence on a case-by-case basis. In one instance, a student alleged being unable to present text messages at a sexual assault hearing, leading to concerns of due process violation. Students in disciplinary proceedings for sexual harassment have challenged decisionmaker bias, with courts requiring evidence to overcome the presumption of impartiality. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a bias claim against a university. In a recent case, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a due process claim alleging bias in a university disciplinary hearing concerning sexual assault. The court found that evidence of bias in the behavior or statements of decisionmakers could give rise to a viable due process challenge. The Sixth Circuit recently held that a student's due process claim was valid in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault bias. The hearing panel member's biased behavior and remarks led to a lack of impartiality. Courts have also addressed bias claims due to institutional pressures, such as unbalanced sexual assault training for university officials. The court found that staff members were biased due to unbalanced sexual assault training, which focused on raising awareness but neglected due process rights. Plaintiffs' claim of bias in expelling students without evidence was dismissed. In contrast, another court allowed a due process claim by an expelled student, citing biased training materials that assumed guilt. This raised concerns about the panel's ability to consider all evidence fairly. The court found potential due process violations in university disciplinary proceedings, where students were unfairly treated in rehearing appeals. In one case, a student was cleared of sexual assault but faced a new hearing without sufficient evidence. In another case, a student initially found not responsible for misconduct was later found guilty without proper notice or time to respond. The school failed to provide the defendant with a fair hearing during the administrative appeal stage, leading to a reversal of the initial decision without proper explanation or opportunity for the defendant to defend himself. Another student was expelled for sexual assault after a rehearing, despite being found not responsible initially. The individual presiding over the appeal expelled the student after conducting off-the-record meetings with the accuser. The court found that the student was not given a fair chance to defend himself and ruled it as a due process violation. In response, OCR withdrew previous guidance on Title IX and began the rulemaking process to clarify schools' responsibilities. The Department of Education announced it would continue to rely on the 2001 Guidance for addressing sexual misconduct, while also introducing new procedures allowing for mediation and appeals in certain circumstances. Additionally, a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued in November 2018, aiming to redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, require \"actual notice\" of harassment, and impose new procedural requirements emphasizing due process in investigations. The proposed regulation aims to redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, establishing higher thresholds for violations based on hostile environment harassment. It includes defining sexual harassment as quid pro quo, hostile environment, or sexual assault, and introduces new procedural requirements emphasizing due process in investigations. The proposed regulations aim to redefine hostile environment harassment under Title IX, setting a higher threshold for what constitutes actionable harassment based on sex. It would define hostile environment harassment as conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity. This is a departure from past administrative practice, which considered \"constructive notice\" to trigger a school's responsibilities in cases of student-on-student harassment. The proposal would establish that a school has a duty to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when it has \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice of harassment to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to institute corrective measures. This aligns with the Supreme Court's standard in Gebser and Davis, rejecting imputing knowledge based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The regulations also clarify that the ability or obligation to report by a school employee does not qualify them as having authority to institute corrective measures. The proposed regulations would require schools to respond to sexual harassment only within their \"education program or activity,\" aligning with the Supreme Court's standards in Gebser and Davis. Schools would now only need to respond in a manner that is not \"deliberately indifferent,\" a departure from past administrative practices. This change would tether a school's responsibility to that outlined by the Court in Davis for private suits for damages. The proposed regulations outline three situations where a school is provided a safe harbor from a finding of deliberate indifference under Title IX. First, when a formal complaint is made, schools must follow outlined grievance procedures. Second, if there is knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, a complaint must be filed. Third, in higher education institutions without a formal complaint, offering and implementing supportive measures to the complainant would prevent a finding of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline situations where a school would not be considered deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment. Schools must follow grievance procedures for formal complaints, file a complaint if there is knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, and offer supportive measures to the complainant in the absence of a formal complaint. Additionally, schools must respond to sexual harassment in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent, including the option to remove an accused individual from an educational program on an emergency basis after conducting a risk and safety analysis. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to investigate formal complaints of sexual harassment, provide notice to relevant parties, and ensure due process protections for accused students. Schools must dismiss complaints that do not meet certain criteria and treat complainants and respondents equitably in grievance procedures. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to provide remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents in grievance procedures related to sexual harassment. This includes an objective evaluation of evidence, unbiased individuals in the decision-making process, a presumption of innocence for respondents, and a description of possible sanctions and remedies. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to provide remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents in grievance procedures related to sexual harassment. This includes an objective evaluation of evidence, unbiased individuals in the decision-making process, a presumption of innocence for respondents, and a description of possible sanctions and remedies. The regulations also outline the school's responsibilities during investigations, such as placing the burden of proof on the school, allowing equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence, and providing written notice of hearings and interviews. Additionally, institutions of higher education must conduct live hearings where parties can ask each other and witnesses relevant questions. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to provide remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents in grievance procedures related to sexual harassment. This includes cross-examination by the party's advisor, live hearings for institutions of higher education, and a report summarizing evidence provided to parties at least 10 days prior to a hearing. The regulations also alter decision-making requirements, ensuring the decisionmaker is not the investigator or Title IX Coordinator. The new Title IX regulations alter decision-making requirements for schools, prohibiting the decisionmaker from being the investigator or Title IX Coordinator. Schools can choose between a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard, with consistent standards for students and employees. Schools may allow appeals and informal resolutions with written consent. The antidiscrimination mandate of Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs, but does not specifically address sexual abuse, harassment, or assault. Federal courts have determined relief for victims based on sparse statutory language, with agencies issuing guidelines for educational institutions to comply with Title IX. Federal agencies have issued guidelines for educational institutions to comply with Title IX, but the statute lacks specific language on sexual abuse or harassment. Congress has the discretion to amend Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement, such as defining conduct that constitutes a violation and addressing liability for harassment in different educational settings. Additionally, Congress could modify legal standards for private suits and direct federal agencies to adjust their enforcement of the statute. Congress has the discretion to amend Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement, such as defining conduct that constitutes a violation and addressing liability for harassment in different educational settings. Additionally, Congress could direct federal agencies to alter their enforcement of the statute by promulgating regulations that distinguish between various types of sexual harassment or treat harassment differently depending on the context."
