    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to pulmonary hypertension. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder with a poor survival rate, affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities. About 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the majority in women aged 21-40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can affect individuals of all ages and ethnicities, with about 6 to 10 percent of cases being familial. In advanced stages, patients may experience severe limitations in activity and may become bedridden. PPH is often difficult to diagnose and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH patient registry in 1981 to study the disease further. The first PPH patient registry was established in 1981 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, following 194 individuals with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors in PPH, as well as the effects of anorexic drugs that can cause the disease. Thousands of Americans have developed PPH from diet drugs, with more cases expected in the future. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is also a concern. Many cases of PPH from diet drugs are anticipated in the future. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) has known causes such as emphysema, bronchitis, and other diseases like scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. Other causes include congenital heart diseases, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's activities. The Director of the Institute will expand research activities on pulmonary hypertension and coordinate with other national research institutes. Grants will be provided to develop centers for research on pulmonary hypertension, focusing on research, training, and education. The centers for research on pulmonary hypertension will conduct basic and clinical research, training programs, and information dissemination to the public. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals in training programs. The Director will coordinate these centers and receive reports on their activities. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center will use facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director will establish at least three centers with support for up to 5 years, extendable for additional periods. The Director of the Institute will establish data systems for collecting and analyzing data on pulmonary hypertension patients and create an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about the condition to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. The Director of the Institute will provide information on pulmonary hypertension programs, gather public input, prepare biennial reports, and authorize appropriations up to $25,000,000 annually from 2004 to 2008."
