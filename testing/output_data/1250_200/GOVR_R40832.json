    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy in the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and highlights unresolved issues. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and information on international organizations involved in animal health standards. The USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the National Animal Identification System. States and tribal nations can choose their own level of animal ID and traceability. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. The USDA established a Traceability Regulation Working Group with state, tribal nation, and APHIS officials to develop a proposed rule for animal disease traceability. Public meetings were held to gather feedback on the framework, and USDA released publications outlining their recommendations in August 2010. The USDA's traceability framework for animal disease management is still evolving, with states and tribal nations being responsible for implementing within-state programs. These programs may include existing ID systems or more detailed birth-to-market ID systems. Federal rules will only apply to livestock moving interstate, with data collection and storage handled by state authorities, not the federal government. The federal rules for livestock traceability will apply to animals moving interstate, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). Exemptions will be defined in the rules, with acceptable identification types outlined in federal regulations. Each state and tribal nation will be evaluated based on performance standards defined through rulemaking, with detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding availability will support the implementation of the traceability framework. The federal rules for livestock traceability will apply to animals moving interstate, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding for animal traceability is not designated in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill, but funding could be considered after needs are identified. The program governing animal disease traceability of interstate animal movements will be implemented through federal regulations. USDA will define animal disease traceability with a new section in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and a proposed rule could be published in April 2011. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease have caused significant economic damages. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic disease outbreaks, but the potential economic consequences of a foot and mouth disease outbreak could be staggering, costing the U.S. cattle industry billions of dollars. The economic impact of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in various countries. These programs vary from voluntary in the United States to mandatory in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Some major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access and have significant economic implications. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It is also a top exporter of pork and beef, while being the leading importer of beef. Animal identification (ID) is crucial for tracking animals from birth to market. U.S. exports of animal products account for a significant portion of domestic production. Animal identification (ID) is essential for tracking farm animals from birth through the marketing chain. It includes information on the animal's origins and traceability to quickly respond to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different countries have variations in their animal ID systems, but the ideal system involves a national database accessible via a high-speed computer network. Animal ID systems track information from birth to slaughter, including details like owner, movements, and slaughter location. Reasons for tracking include rapid response to health concerns and verifying premium production processes. In the US, focus is on animal health, while other countries like the EU prioritize both health and food safety. In countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea, animal ID systems focus on both animal health and food safety, with comprehensive traceability systems extending to the retail consumer. International buyers are demanding more information on the history of animal products, leading to the need for traceability systems. Proponents argue that a national animal ID system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication. A national animal ID and traceability system can enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of disease outbreaks and minimizing the economic impact of outbreaks through compartmentalization. This system would reduce disease testing costs for producers and limit the spread of harmful diseases, ultimately benefiting regional and national levels. Compartmentalization helps reduce economic damage from disease outbreaks and re-establish international market access. Farmers can benefit from increased domestic marketing opportunities by tracking individual animals and meeting specific production standards. Universal bar codes aid in managing inventories and verifying production methods for consumers seeking specific animal-raising practices. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's process verification program, support these efforts. Government-coordinated programs, such as USDA's process verification program, provide livestock and meat producers with the opportunity to assure customers of consistent quality products through independent audits. These programs also include traceability measures like the national organic certification program and mandatory country-of-origin labeling. Traceability programs offer valuable management tools for producers by providing post-mortem information on production techniques and success factors. An animal ID and traceability program would help producers track performance history, increase transparency in the supply chain, maintain records on animal movements and health, and address food safety and national security concerns. This program collaborates with federal and state food safety agencies to protect the food supply from threats to human health and foodborne illnesses. Regulators struggle to trace specific animals involved in food recalls. Some believe a better traceback system would help contain foodborne illnesses, while others in the food industry argue it would be costly and unworkable. Traceability systems also enhance foreign marketing opportunities for animal products by reassuring buyers about animal health and meeting safety requirements. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. Establishing traceability systems is crucial for enhancing competitiveness in foreign markets. Lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving the best status for BSE from the OIE. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. Lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving the best status for BSE from the OIE. Receiving negligible risk status would enhance the United States' ability to compete internationally and support U.S. domestic price structures. An animal ID system could enhance animal welfare in response to natural disasters, but opponents argue it constitutes an invasion of privacy and increases costs and technical complexity. Critics argue that implementing a national animal identification system could lead to increased costs and technical complexity, with the majority of the financial burden falling on the cattle sector. Additionally, the system may favor vertical integration over family farms, as individual animals would need to be tagged, unlike in the pork and poultry industries where animals are raised and moved in lots. Implementing a national animal identification system could disadvantage cattle producers due to added costs and lack of market power. Some producers object on religious grounds, fearing increased transparency at the farm level. Some producers are concerned that increased transparency at the farm level may lead to higher tax liabilities. A national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from various disease eradication programs, such as the successful brucellosis eradication program that required animal ID tags. The U.S. animal ID program, which evolved from disease eradication programs like brucellosis, has become less common as these programs wind down. Certain livestock classes have long had official ID requirements for interstate commerce, but these programs vary in scope and management. U.S. faced challenges in tracing cattle after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003, leading to reluctance from trading partners to reopen borders. The U.S. faced challenges in tracing cattle after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003, leading to reluctance from trading partners to reopen borders. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, first proposed in 2002, aimed to improve traceability but faced criticism from the cattle sector for its cost and implementation burden. USDA replaced NAIS with a more flexible, state-based program in 2010. The NAIS system faced criticism from the U.S. cattle sector due to cost and implementation burden, especially on cattle producers. It aimed to cover major livestock and poultry species but excluded household pets. Animals entering commerce or commingling with others were to be identified, with group identification allowed for hogs and poultry. NAIS was voluntary and its implementation was a key issue. The USDA focused on popularizing the voluntary NAIS program, ensuring information availability, and addressing implementation issues by prioritizing species, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states and industry, and advancing ID technologies. Reports were published to provide guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies for participants and stakeholders. Three reports provided detailed information about the NAIS program, including participation guidelines and future implementation direction. A Business Plan outlined strategies to enhance animal disease traceability, while the NAIS User Guide offered guidance for producers and owners on participation benefits. Program Standards and Technical Reference established data standards for NAIS, ensuring compatibility across information systems. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to establish standards for identification numbers and devices to ensure system effectiveness in protecting U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks. USDA's goals for NAIS included enhancing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. NAIS was not a food safety program but could have positive public safety effects. The USDA's long-term goal with the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to quickly identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease outbreak to minimize economic impact and protect animal producers. NAIS aimed to provide rapid access to complete data on animal ID and movement history to contain outbreaks and limit commercial damage. The system consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking to facilitate quick traceback and identify exposed animals. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. Premises registration involved collecting information such as premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact details, and location coordinates. Producers could have multiple PINs for different operations. Premises were registered with state or tribal animal health authorities. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required premises registration with state or tribal animal health authorities to protect private information and aid in disease outbreak response. By September 2009, only 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations, falling short of USDA's goal for higher participation levels. The second phase of NAIS involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or groups, such as swine or poultry, using a 15-digit Animal Identification Number (AIN) with the country code 840. Tags and devices complying with the 15-digit AIN system are known as 840 devices, obtained from authorized manufacturers for animal identification under NAIS. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification under NAIS. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders is increasing as they allow for faster access to ID information and reduce stress on animals. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low disease risk. The USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises for disease control, regardless of the number of animals present. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location, such as a livestock market or feedlot. Producers can choose when to place the ID on the animal, with some opting to do so shortly after birth. If animals cannot be tagged at their current premises, they can be tagged at an auction market before being commingled with animals from other premises. Tagging services are available for producers to market their animals, with animals being tagged before being commingled with others. Producers bringing animals into their operation are expected to maintain official identification already on the animal. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, with the GIN consisting of a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit number reflecting the count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. The NAIS involves a self-generated Group Identification Number (GIN) for livestock or poultry, linking them to their birthplace. Producers can report animal movements to compliant databases for disease traceability and containment. Under NAIS, producers report animal movements to a national database using standardized tracing information, including premises and animal ID numbers, date of event, and event type. Other animal-specific data is standardized but not required for participation. Movements within a production unit for management purposes are not necessary to report. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership involving industry and states operating and maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) to safeguard animal health. Under NAIS, producers report animal movements to a national database using standardized tracing information. States and private entities operate and maintain ATDs containing animal location records for confidentiality. USDA's Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) allows officials to request information during disease events. ATDs provide timely reports for disease containment within a 48-hour window. State and federal officials use the system for suspect or confirmed positive tests for foreign animal diseases. Health officials would use the system in specific situations: an indication or confirmed positive test for a foreign animal disease, an animal disease emergency, or a need for traceback/traceforward for certain diseases. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the US had been registered, with varying participation rates across species. By September 2009, over 530,000 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the US. Effective response to disease outbreaks requires a certain level of participation. To achieve effective response to animal disease outbreaks, USDA's NAIS program aims for a \"critical mass\" level of 70% participation in identifying and tracing animals to their premises. Dr. John Clifford suggests a participation rate as high as 90% for full benefits. Critics have faulted USDA for slow progress and lack of clear direction towards universal animal ID. A 2007 GAO report highlighted obstacles to implementing the program effectively. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified obstacles hindering effective implementation of animal ID, such as lack of prioritization among species, integration plan with existing requirements, and low participation rates in USDA's NAIS program. Calls were made for Congress to address low participation either by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and various industry groups support mandatory participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to prevent devastating losses from virulent diseases. Congressional leaders also express interest in making NAIS mandatory. Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rosa DeLauro, supports making NAIS mandatory to prevent losses from diseases. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, fear high costs and industry concentration. Some question USDA's ability to keep information confidential. Congressional members from cattle-heavy areas share industry concerns. There is uncertainty over the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to decide NAIS's status, but in August 2006, then-Secretary Mike Johanns addressed industry worries. In August 2006, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that NAIS would remain voluntary despite industry concerns. The debate over a mandatory program continues, with questions about costs, funding, and who should pay. USDA's proposals suggest sharing expenses between government and producers. USDA's proposals for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involve sharing expenses between the government and producers. There are concerns that larger retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it harder for smaller operations to survive. A study by APHIS in 2009 evaluated the economic benefits and costs of implementing NAIS, with input from economists at various universities. The report by researchers from various universities estimated the costs of implementing NAIS across multiple species with varying participation rates. The study assumed individual ID tagging for cattle, group ID tagging for swine (except for breeding animals), and unique group ID tagging for poultry. The estimated annual costs for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation were around $228 million for livestock industries, increasing to $304.2 million when horses were included. The majority of costs were associated with the cattle sector, at $5.97 per animal marketed. The study estimated that identification tags and tagging for cattle accounted for 75% of the cattle sector's annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. In comparison, other livestock sectors had lower costs per animal: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweighed the costs, including savings in disease control programs, quicker market recovery after outbreaks, and potential access to international markets. The study found that the implementation of NAIS could bring economic benefits such as re-establishing markets quickly after disease outbreaks, expanded market access, and increased consumer demand. Producers may face concerns about liability for contamination, but documenting management practices can help protect against this. There are also questions about whether producers should be protected from public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act. Producers are concerned about public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Some worry about animal rights extremists misusing information obtained through FOIA, or revealing proprietary information. FOIA exempts certain business information like trade secrets. In the 110th Congress, a provision addressing protection of trade secrets in an animal ID system was deleted from a farm bill. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, while the EU already requires traceability for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef, but the opposition Democratic Party of Japan plans to pass a \"Beef Traceability Law\" to impose traceability requirements on imported beef. The DPJ won 308 seats in the Japanese Diet and aims to form a coalition to pass legislation. India is the only major beef exporter without a traceability system. India, the only major beef exporter without a traceability system, may need to implement one soon to meet global standards. The WTO's rules on non-tariff trade barriers, like traceability requirements, could impact market access. The USDA has invested heavily in developing a National Animal Identification System (NAIS) since 2004. The USDA invested nearly $142 million in the development of NAIS, but participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held listening sessions to address concerns and ultimately decided to abandon NAIS in favor of a more flexible, state-based system. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010, following concerns raised during listening sessions and written comments. Congress expressed frustration with the slow implementation of NAIS despite significant funding allocated from FY2004 to FY2009. In 2009, funding for NAIS was proposed to increase slightly, but it was ultimately eliminated from the FY2010 appropriations bill by the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. The FY2010 appropriations bill (H.R. 2997) allocated funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), but Congress expressed frustration with the slow implementation and lack of effectiveness. The Senate reduced funding for NAIS to $7.3 million for ongoing activities. The FY2010 funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reduced to $5.3 million, resolved in conference after Senate amendments. USDA claimed authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to clarify USDA's authority or establish a national ID system. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to establish a national animal ID system and improve traceability for meat and poultry products. These bills aimed to trace animals from holding premises to slaughter and track meat/poultry products through processing and distribution to consumers. Additionally, traceability provisions were included in food safety legislation approved by the House and expected to be included in a Senate bill. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a national animal ID system and improve traceability for meat and poultry products. Provisions were included in food safety legislation approved by the House, but these would apply to FDA-regulated foods, not FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. Public hearings were held to review the National Animal Identification System, with a history of animal ID dating back to the 1800s in the United States. In the 1800s, hot iron brands were used in the U.S. West for animal ID. In the 1940s, a program for identifying vaccinated cattle for brucellosis was initiated. The system was successful but phased out as brucellosis neared eradication. In the 1950s-1980s, plans for a national animal ID system began. In 1986-1988, BSE was first identified in the UK's cattle, leading to widespread testing and slaughter. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, outbreaks of diseases such as BSE, foot and mouth disease, and Classical Swine Fever led to the slaughter of millions of cattle and pigs in the UK, Taiwan, and the Netherlands, resulting in significant economic losses. In response, efforts were made to develop a national animal identification plan in the US in the early 2000s. In December 2003, the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) was drafted by a group of representatives, calling for recording animal movements in a central database. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system, allocating numbers to premises and animals, and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and for major species to be identified by July 2006. The draft was published amidst the first case of mad cow disease in the US, prompting accelerated implementation of a national animal ID system to boost confidence in the beef supply. The implementation of a national animal ID system was accelerated by then-Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, who transferred $18.8 million of funds to APHIS. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was announced in April 2004, with periodic revisions to the program. By August 2006, the program was initially voluntary but had plans to transition to mandatory participation if needed. In August 2006, the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory. However, due to concerns from producers, small farmers, and religious groups, it remained voluntary at the federal level. A three-step approach was proposed in a user guide for premises registration, animal ID, and traceability. The program assured confidentiality of business information and remained voluntary. In December 2007, a user guide and additional information resource were released by USDA's APHIS for NAIS. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory in August 2006. A Business Plan was released in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability, with a goal of 48-hour traceback in case of an outbreak. The plan prioritized species into Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories, aiming to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. In January 2009, a proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published for comment. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) transitioned from voluntary to mandatory in August 2006. A Business Plan in April 2008 aimed for 48-hour traceback in case of an outbreak. In January 2009, a proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published for comment. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009. USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability in February 2010, allowing states to choose their own level of within-state animal identification. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. The USDA proposed a revision requiring all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held in 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The US participates in international organizations related to animal health and trade. The United States participates in international organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO), CODEX alimentarius, and the OIE to harmonize trade rules and recommend standards for food safety and animal health. The WTO restricts non-tariff trade barriers and traceability measures to be scientifically justified and equivalent to health risks. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963 by the FAO and WHO, develops food standards and guidelines to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), founded in 1924, sets international standards for animal health and traceability to improve animal health globally. The OIE is a leading international organization for animal identification and traceability, helping member countries implement systems to improve disease prevention, food safety, and export certification. The OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability in 2006, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The Director General called for worldwide implementation of animal identification and traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" under OIE standards. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on compartmentalization and export certification. Certification ensures compliance with importing countries' standards through plant inspection and sanitary sampling. The OIE aims to harmonize international certification processes. The OIE contributes to harmonization of international certification standards through various programs and promotes transparency and reliance on scientific information. Many countries have adopted national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities. Canada's national individual identification system for cattle and bison is managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA), a nonprofit organization led by representatives from the livestock industry. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) oversees the national individual identification system for cattle and bison in Canada. Initially voluntary, the program became mandatory in 2002, transitioning to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in 2003. All cattle leaving their farm of origin must now be tagged with a CCIA-approved RFID tag for tracking purposes. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) ensures data integrity and full animal movement tracking through the Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS). CCIA reported a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% for Canadian cattle ID. Personal information linked to ear tag numbers is securely stored in the national database. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) tracks livestock from birth to slaughter, with mandatory cattle identification since 2005 and a tracing system for sheep. Australia implemented an animal identification system in the 1960s to eradicate diseases. A mandatory cattle identification system using Property Identification Codes (PICs) was established in 1967. In the mid-1990s, the system transitioned to electronic RFID technology for whole-of-life individual cattle identification. This was done to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification was further enhanced in 1998 in response to a trading partner. In 1998, individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market with meat from Hormone Growth Promotant-free cattle. The NLIS was introduced in 1999, ensuring traceability of animals within 24 hours. By 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. This system allows for tracking of live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. The NLIS in Australia ensures traceability of animals through individual identification, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. The Federal government coordinates the system with funding, while state governments manage livestock movement and health. State governments work with industry to develop legislation and provide education programs for producers on technology use. The NLIS in Australia ensures traceability of animals through individual identification, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) administers the database for NLIS, protecting data from Australian Freedom of Information. The European Union (EU) has mandatory animal identification programs for food safety, focusing on localization and tracing for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease events like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. In response to disease events like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, the EU implemented a mandatory system of permanent identification for bovine animals in 1997. This system includes double ear tags for individual identification, cattle passports for recording movements, and a national database for tracking information. Additionally, regulations require labeling of meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin. The EU regulations mandate the labeling of meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state of harvest, and the facility's approval number. Mandatory food traceability has been in place since 2005. Equidae and porcine animals have identification systems in place, while ovine and caprine animals were included in 2005. Japan also has a bovine ID and traceability system since 2004. Imported beef currently does not have the same traceability requirements as domestic beef, but there is growing pressure for this to change. Imported beef in Japan is not currently held to the same traceability standards as domestically produced beef. However, there is increasing political pressure to implement such requirements. Following food safety crises in the early 2000s, Japan enacted laws for animal traceability and food safety oversight. The first phase began in 2002 with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures, requiring traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by 2003. The second phase included the Food Safety Basic Law in 2003 and the Beef Traceability Law in 2004, extending traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers. Retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. In Japan, retailers and restaurants display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. The Ministry of Agriculture introduced a Japan Agricultural Standard program for traceability of imported beef. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System for domestically produced beef, tracking each animal from birth to consumer. The Beef Traceability System (BTS) in South Korea tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's details, feed, medications, slaughter date, inspection date, and processing location. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. In contrast, New Zealand lacks a fully operational national animal ID system but is working on developing the National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) system since 2006. The NAIT system in New Zealand is still in development as of early 2009, focusing on traceability for cattle and deer populations. Existing partial systems like MINDA and NBTIP do not provide effective traceability for individual animals. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) plans to expand the NAIT system to other species once it is fully operational for cattle and deer. The MINDA system in New Zealand has high dairy herd participation but lacks animal traceability. The NTBIP is a mandatory system for cattle and deer identification before movement. Brazil implemented the SISBOV system for cattle identification, later extending it to the entire beef chain. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed for June 2011. Brazil's SISBOV program, initially intended as mandatory for animal identification, remains voluntary due to lack of domestic demand. It focuses on providing origination information for slaughterhouses exporting to markets like the EU. Despite shortcomings in animal traceability, the EU accepted individual tags for cattle sold to approved farms. In 2008, the EU imposed restrictions on Brazilian beef imports. In 2008, the EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil, citing concerns about a lack of robust information and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Argentina established a limited mandatory animal identification system for exports to the EU, but the entire beef herd is not expected to be fully tagged until 2017. Argentina is working on a compulsory cattle identification program to track cattle from birth to slaughter by 2017. Due to past disease outbreaks, its beef exports to the US have been restricted. Uruguay heavily relies on foreign markets for beef sales, with 68% of production sold abroad from 2004-2008. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system in late 2006. Uruguay's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries implemented the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be tagged before six months of age or transport. The system includes two tags per animal, one visible and one electronic, with plans to have all herds registered and tagged by 2010. SNIG extends traceability to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. The database includes premises and animal movement records, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. The National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in Uruguay requires cattle to be tagged before six months of age. SNIG includes premises, animal movement, and termination data. The government currently pays for ID tags but plans to shift the cost to producers. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs due to technological limitations, local production chains, and financial constraints of consumers. In poorer countries, lower-income consumers are unable to pay extra for traceable food products."
