    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on the Internal Revenue Code, with adjustments, and is only applicable when resources are allocated for oversight and audits by the Franchise Tax Board. The earned income tax credit percentages and amounts for eligible individuals with qualifying children are as follows:\n- No qualifying children: 7.65% credit percentage and $3,290 earned income amount\n- 1 qualifying child: 34% credit percentage and $4,940 earned income amount\n- 2 qualifying children: 40% credit percentage and $6,935 earned income amount\n- 3 or more qualifying children: 45% credit percentage and $6,935 earned income amount. Modifications to certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are also specified. Modifications to specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code include changes to the earned income tax credit percentages and amounts for eligible individuals with qualifying children. These changes involve adjustments to various subsections, such as Section 32(c)(2)(A), Section 32(c)(3)(C), Section 32(i)(1), and Section 32(j), for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016. The Franchise Tax Board may prescribe rules for implementing the credit allowed for the 2015 taxable year, and amounts refunded will be treated similarly to federal earned income refunds for determining eligibility for benefits under the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Franchise Tax Board is exempt from certain reporting requirements for implementing the 2015 tax credit. They will incorporate changes in their next report for the Enterprise Data to Revenue Project. The purpose of the California Earned Income Tax Credit is to reduce poverty, and the Board will annually report on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will report on the number of tax returns claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including details such as the average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The report will be provided to various Senate and Assembly committees. The California Earned Income Tax Credit, known as the tax credit allowed by this section, applies to taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016."
