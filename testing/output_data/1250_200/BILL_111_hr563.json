    "content": "The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires priority for SCHIP coverage of children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates the inclusion of income-related data in annual reports under the Social Security Act to assess the success of states in providing health insurance for children at different income levels. The Secretary is required to establish standards for data collection and statistical methodologies by September 30, 2009. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires states to develop and implement a plan to ensure all low-income children have health coverage, with approval needed from the Secretary before fiscal year 2010. The Secretary must promptly review and approve or disapprove state plans for low-income children's health coverage by fiscal year 2010. If a plan is disapproved, the state can resubmit a modified plan for consideration. The Secretary will notify the state of the approval or disapproval promptly. In subsection (5), a qualified low-income child is defined as a child whose family's gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size and meets all eligibility requirements except income. Section 2105(c) of the Act limits the use of SCHIP funds based on increases in income eligibility levels set by the State. Payment under this section to a State for individuals with family income above the eligibility level is restricted unless the State proves that no more than 10% of low-income children are without health coverage. There is a safe harbor for qualified low-income children and currently eligible children, exempting them from this restriction. The paragraph defines eligibility standards for children under the State child health plan as of the enactment date."
