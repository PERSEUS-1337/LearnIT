    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Auto Safety Enhancement Act of 2010\". Congress finds that event data recorders offer important benefits for motor vehicle safety, such as enabling automatic crash notification systems, increasing understanding of crashworthiness, and providing insight into vehicle defects. With over 38,000 annual road fatalities in the United States, utilizing event data recorders could significantly reduce deaths. The inclusion of these recorders in new vehicles would outweigh any financial burden on manufacturers, as stated by the National Transportation Safety Board. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends installing event data recorders on light passenger vehicles, schoolbuses, and motorcoaches, stating that the benefits outweigh the financial burden on manufacturers. SEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS. The text discusses the requirement for event data recorders in motor vehicles manufactured from 2012 onwards. The Secretary of Transportation must establish rules for equipping vehicles with event data recorders meeting specific specifications and data retrieval methods. The recorders must be able to survive crashes without data loss. The text outlines the criteria for event data recorders in vehicles, including surviving specific crash tests without data loss. The event data recorder in vehicles must record various data elements such as yaw data, safety belt status, vehicle speed, airbag deployment, rollover data, and operation of safety systems like ABS and traction control. The event data recorder in vehicles must record various data elements such as yaw data, safety belt status, vehicle speed, airbag deployment, rollover data, and operation of safety systems like ABS, traction control, electronic stability control, and roll stability control. Additionally, it should include the vehicle identification number, date, time, odometer reading, tire pressure, and other data elements specified in regulations. The event data recorder in vehicles must record crash data for at least 60 seconds before and 15 seconds after the event, have tamper resistance safeguards, and be compatible with a universal data retrieval method. The Secretary will specify data format requirements for a universal data retrieval method for event data recorders in motor vehicles. This method allows recorded data to be easily extracted and analyzed for vehicle safety performance. Additionally, the Secretary will establish a process for individuals or entities to transmit data from event data recorders for periodic evaluations and modifications. The Secretary will conduct periodic evaluations and make modifications to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the established process for event data recorders. A database will be created for research and analysis purposes, containing data from event data recorders and relevant sources like police accident reports. The Secretary will establish a database for event data recorders, including information from police accident reports. The data will be available to the public, but personally identifiable information will be excluded. The Secretary of Transportation will require motor vehicle manufacturers to ensure that event data recorders in vehicles manufactured before model year 2012 have readable data. This data includes vehicle identification numbers, owner information, and other details protected by law for privacy reasons. The term 'event data recorder' is defined in federal regulations. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires vehicle manufacturers to ensure that event data recorders in vehicles manufactured before model year 2012 have data that can be read by the Administration. This data should allow for analysis of the safety performance of the vehicle. The rule regarding event data recorders defines the term and specifies that it will take effect within 30 days of promulgation. It states that the data stored in these recorders belong to the vehicle owner or lessee and can only be accessed by them, unless authorized by a court or with consent for vehicle diagnosis or repair purposes. The rule allows for the retrieval of data from event data recorders with the owner or lessee's consent for vehicle diagnosis or repair purposes. Government motor vehicle safety agencies can also access the data for safety improvement without disclosing personally identifiable information. Event data recorders required for model year 2012 or later, readability of data in event data recorders prior to 2012, and privacy of data in event data recorders. Report on feasibility of automatic transmission of EDR data. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment on the feasibility of requiring motor vehicles with event data recorders to automatically transmit crash data to the Secretary. The report will analyze the systems for automatic data transmission, benefits of maintaining a database, and the cost to manufacturers. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the feasibility of requiring automatic transmission of crash data from event data recorders in motor vehicles. The report should include an analysis of compliance costs for manufacturers, a recommended timeline for implementation, and a review of privacy concerns with recommendations for addressing them."
