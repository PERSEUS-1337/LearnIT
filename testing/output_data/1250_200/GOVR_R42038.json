    "content": "Insurance companies are a significant part of the U.S. financial services industry, divided into life/health insurance and property/casualty insurance. In 2011, life/health companies had premiums of $581.4 billion, while property/casualty companies had premiums of $436.0 billion. The industry's total assets were around $7.5 trillion. Different types of insurance have varying characteristics and risks, with life insurance being long-term, property/casualty insurance being shorter-term with higher catastrophic risk exposure, and health insurance being closely tied to healthcare delivery. Insurance companies in the U.S. are a significant part of the financial services industry, divided into life/health insurance and property/casualty insurance. Life insurance is long-term, while property/casualty insurance has higher catastrophic risk exposure. Health insurance is closely tied to healthcare delivery. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for 150 years due to a 1868 U.S. Supreme Court decision. This report primarily focuses on life insurance and property/casualty insurance, with federal regulations influenced by Medicare, Medicaid, ERISA, and the ACA. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 was passed to preserve states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry. This came after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association in 1944, which raised concerns about state insurance regulation. Congress has reviewed the jurisdictional stewardship under the Act, with some exceptions like the Liability Risk Retention Act for certain types of liability insurance. The 50-state structure of insurance regulation has some narrow exceptions, such as the Liability Risk Retention Act created by Congress in 1981. Proposals to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government have been opposed by states and the insurance industry. Efforts for regulatory reform have been made at the state level by groups like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the National Conference of Insurance Legislators. Insolvencies of large insurance companies in the mid-1980s spurred a major effort to transfer regulatory authority to the federal government. The push to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government began in the mid-1980s after insolvencies of large insurance companies. Former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell questioned state regulation's ability to oversee the industry and proposed creating a federal insurance regulatory agency. State regulators and the industry opposed this, leading to reforms at the state level and NAIC, including a new accreditation program for state solvency regulation. Despite these changes, another breach in the state regulatory system occurred in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, a breach in the state regulatory system occurred when Martin Frankel diverted over $200 million from small life insurance companies. State insurance guaranty funds were introduced in the late 1980s to protect insurance consumers in case of insolvency, similar to the FDIC for banks. The state steps in to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer's assets, with the guaranty fund using the assets to pay claims, typically up to certain limits. Existing insurers may be assessed to cover any shortfall in the fund. The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act overhauled the financial regulatory system in the US, driven by market changes known as \"convergence\" in financial services. Insurers assessed by guaranty funds can write off the assessments on future state taxes, indirectly supporting the funds. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 led to market convergence in financial services, breaking down distinctions between products and providers. It allowed banks and securities firms to compete with insurance companies, creating a new competitive landscape. GLBA reaffirmed state insurance regulators as the primary regulators of insurance products, maintaining the existing regulatory structure. Some insurance companies feel state regulation puts them at a disadvantage post-GLBA. They argue that non-insurer competitors have more efficient federal regulation, leading to delays in getting products to market. Life insurers now compete with banks offering similar products, but banks can launch nationwide in weeks while insurers face up to two years for state approvals. Industry resistance to federal intervention in insurance has shifted post-GLBA. Resistance to federal intervention in insurance changed post-GLBA, with industry participants supporting broad regulatory change for insurance through an optional federal charter. GLBA also addressed modernizing state laws for insurance agents and brokers, including the creation of NARAB. Despite concerns about state actions, not every state has implemented reciprocity for insurance producer licensing. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to increase competition in financial services, but the expected convergence of banks, securities firms, and insurers did not fully materialize. While large bank-insurer mergers did not happen as anticipated, there was still significant convergence within each sector. Banks began distributing insurance and insurers started offering financing-like products. Despite the functional regulation introduced by GLBA, regulatory practices have still tended to follow institutional lines. Despite the functional regulation introduced by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, regulatory practices have still tended to follow institutional lines. Congressional interest in insurance regulatory issues continued from the 107th through the 110th Congresses, particularly in the House of Representatives. Various proposals for federal intervention in insurance regulation were put forward, but none were advanced by the committees of jurisdiction. Additionally, narrower bills addressing different facets of insurance regulation were introduced, including surplus lines, reinsurance, insurance producer licensing, and expansion of the Liability Risk Retention Act. The financial crisis that began in 2007 reached panic proportions as the 110th Congress approached its close. The financial crisis of 2007 escalated as the 110th Congress neared its end, leading to panic with the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the failure of Lehman Brothers, and the government rescue of AIG in September 2008. This crisis brought new issues to the ongoing debate on insurance regulatory reforms, highlighting failures in the financial regulatory structure and the need for increased systemic risk regulation and federal oversight of insurance, especially larger firms. Despite the crisis, the good performance of insurers also supported arguments for maintaining the state-based insurance system. The financial crisis of 2007 highlighted failures in the financial regulatory structure and the need for increased systemic risk regulation and federal oversight of insurance, especially larger firms. The crisis saw two notable failures in the insurance industry, with bond insurers facing strains due to exposure to mortgage-backed securities, leading to downgrades that caused unexpected difficulties for investors and municipalities. The financial crisis of 2007 exposed failures in the financial regulatory structure, leading to unexpected difficulties for investors and municipalities. American International Group (AIG) faced a significant failure in mid-September 2008, seeking over $100 billion in assistance from the Federal Reserve to prevent bankruptcy. The U.S. government ultimately owned 92% of AIG, with all Federal Reserve assistance repaid and the U.S. Treasury selling most of its equity stake. The near collapse of AIG and bond insurers could be seen as regulatory failures in ensuring solvency and ability to pay claims. The financial crisis of 2007 revealed regulatory failures, with AIG seeking massive assistance from the Federal Reserve to avoid bankruptcy. The case highlighted the need for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation, as AIG's failure stemmed from oversight issues between state-chartered insurance subsidiaries and federally regulated entities. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve's perspective on overseeing systemic risk prevailed, leading to the absorption of the Office of Thrift Supervision into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in response to the financial crisis, transferred oversight authority of large financial holding companies from the Office of Thrift Supervision to the Federal Reserve. It also created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to address systemic risk in the insurance industry. Additionally, the Act harmonized the tax and regulatory treatment of surplus lines insurance and reinsurance. The 112th Congress is addressing insurance issues such as oversight of the Dodd-Frank Act, reforming regulatory systems, and responding to international developments like Solvency II. Recent legislation includes proposals for a federal insurance charter and changes to the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust exclusion. The House Committee on Financial Services' Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity has held hearings on these topics. The House Committee on Financial Services' Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity has held hearings on insurance oversight and legislative proposals, international competitiveness, and the impact of Dodd-Frank's insurance regulations. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has also held hearings on insurance regulation issues. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to monitor the insurance industry and coordinate policy on international agreements. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry, coordinating policy on international agreements, and has limited preemption authority over state laws that conflict with international agreements. FIO's monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources, with subpoena power if necessary. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has subpoena power to gather necessary information from public and private sources. H.R. 3559 in the 112th Congress aims to limit this power. The office, led by Director Michael McRaith, has been active in international discussions but faced delays in its establishment and reports to Congress. The Dodd-Frank Act includes systemic-risk provisions that could impact the insurance industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes systemic-risk provisions that potentially affect the insurance industry through enhanced Federal Reserve oversight, higher prudential standards for banks with over $50 billion in assets, and designation of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) by the FSOC. The FSOC is responsible for identifying risks to financial stability and includes a presidential appointee, state insurance commissioner, and FIO director. Federal Reserve may set higher prudential standards based on risk factors, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. The Federal Reserve sets higher prudential standards for banks with over $50 billion in assets, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on systemically significant firms and issues regulations for early remediation measures to prevent insolvency and financial instability. A proposed rule for higher prudential standards has been put forth but not finalized. It is uncertain if a second rule for non-bank institutions will be released. The Federal Reserve sets higher prudential standards for banks with over $50 billion in assets, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. A proposed rule for higher prudential standards has been put forth but not finalized. It is uncertain if a second rule for non-bank institutions will be released. The resolution of systemically important financial firms does not have a pre-funded mechanism under the act. Instead, the FDIC imposes assessments on financial companies with more than $50 billion in assets to fund the resolution of a failed firm if its assets are insufficient. The FDIC imposes assessments on financial companies to fund the resolution of systemically important firms. Insurers are not specifically addressed in the new resolution regime rules issued by the FDIC. Insurers argue they do not pose a systemic risk due to the nature of insurance operations and high capital requirements by state regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated oversight of thrift holding companies and bank holding companies under the Federal Reserve, strengthening capital standards. The Federal Reserve is also implementing higher capital standards for banks under Basel III. 27 bank or thrift holding companies overseen by the Federal Reserve are largely engaged in the business of insurance. No insurers have been deemed systemically important by the FSOC yet. The Federal Reserve oversees 27 bank or thrift holding companies engaged in insurance, with some like AIG, Nationwide, and State Farm being major insurers. Banking/thrift assets total $124.3 billion, while insurance operations have $23 trillion in assets. USAA is an exception with large thrift assets. The \"Volcker Rule\" in Dodd-Frank may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries, but there are exemptions for regulated insurance companies. The Volcker Rule in Dodd-Frank may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries, but there are exemptions for regulated insurance companies. The exemption allows trading by a regulated insurance company and its affiliates for the general account of the company, as long as transactions comply with applicable laws and regulations. The FSOC has recommended careful monitoring of fund flows between banking entities and insurance companies to prevent rule manipulation. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasized the need for appropriate regulation considering the unique assets and liabilities of insurance companies. Some insurers are concerned that Federal Reserve capital rules do not consider the unique characteristics of the industry, leading them to sell banking subsidiaries to avoid oversight. Dodd-Frank Act addresses insurance regulatory issues, harmonizing regulation and taxation for nonadmitted insurance. MetLife is the largest firm taking steps to remove themselves from Federal Reserve oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act harmonizes regulation and taxation for nonadmitted insurance, giving the \"home state\" of the insured sole authority over regulation and tax collection. It also preempts conflicting state laws on surplus lines eligibility and vests authority over reinsurance transactions in the home state of the insurer and reinsurer. NAIC and NCOIL developed interstate agreements to supersede federal provisions on tax distribution. Interstate agreements developed by NAIC and NCOIL differ in authority ceded by states. NCOIL's SLIMPACT addresses surplus lines regulatory issues and taxes, while NAIC's NIMA focuses on tax allocation. Lack of uniformity addressed in congressional hearings, with plans to blend approaches. H.R. 1112 introduced in 2011 but progress towards uniformity unclear. H.R. 1112, introduced in 2011, aims to establish NARAB, a national association for insurance producers. NARAB would allow licensed producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee, preempting state laws that treat out-of-state producers differently. The board overseeing NARAB would consist of industry and state appointees, with the President having authority over its actions. This legislation is often referred to as \"NARAB 2\" and dates back to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 established NARAB to streamline state insurance producer licensing. H.R. 2126, introduced in 2011, expands federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups. California, Florida, and Washington have not implemented uniformity and reciprocity laws for insurance producer licensing. H.R. 2126 expands federal preemption for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups, adding enforcement mechanisms and corporate governance requirements. The bill allows the Federal Insurance Office director to issue determinations on state regulations, study compliance with the LRRA, and set corporate governance standards for RRGs. The bill H.R. 3559 introduces governance standards for risk retention groups, including independence of the board and audit committee, limited contracts with service providers, and expanded consumer disclosure. It also imposes a fiduciary duty on the board of directors. The bill removes the Federal Insurance Office's authority to issue subpoenas and extends confidentiality requirements for insurance information. H.R. 6423, introduced by Representative Bill Posey and Representative Judy Biggert, aims to amend Dodd-Frank by removing insurance companies from the resolution regime created by the law. It would eliminate the FDIC's backup authority to resolve insurance subsidiaries and exclude insurance companies from the FDIC's assessment authority. The bill also extends confidentiality requirements for insurance information shared by the Federal Insurance Office or gathered by federal financial regulators. The United States has a surplus in trade in financial services, except for insurance where there is a deficit. Consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities. The need for federal involvement in insurance regulation is growing due to the internationalization of the financial services industry. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is developing federal policy in international insurance matters. The European Union is implementing Solvency II to transform the EU into a single market for financial services. The EU is implementing Solvency II to create a single market for financial services, aiming to match capital requirements with insurer risks. Delays have put the 2014 implementation in doubt, but the creation of EIOPA aims to develop binding regulations. This could enhance the competitiveness of EU insurers compared to U.S. insurers. The EU is implementing Solvency II to create a single market for financial services, aiming to match capital requirements with insurer risks. A more efficient regulatory system in the EU could improve the competitive standing of EU insurers compared with U.S. insurers. Concerns have been raised about potential discrimination against U.S. insurers if their supervision is deemed insufficiently equivalent. EIOPA has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan but not for the United States. An EU regulatory change could help improve access for European reinsurers to foreign markets, such as the United States. The complexity of the U.S. regulatory system has been cited as a barrier for overseas companies. Access to the U.S. market for insurance is a significant issue for EU insurers, just as access to the EU is for U.S. insurers. Access to the U.S. market for insurance is a significant issue for EU insurers due to state regulatory requirements for reinsurance. Non-U.S. reinsurers have requested a reduction in the 100% collateral backing requirement, citing disparities with U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC has been hesitant to recommend a reduction, citing concerns of unpaid claims and difficulties in collecting judgments overseas. In 2009, draft federal legislation was proposed to enforce national standards for reinsurance collateral, including potential reductions for highly rated reinsurers. In 2010, an NAIC Task Force approved recommendations to reduce required collateral based on the financial strength of the reinsurer. In 2010, an NAIC Task Force approved recommendations to reduce required collateral for reinsurers based on their financial strength. These changes need to be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators. 11 states, representing 40% of US insurance premiums, have revised statutes or regulations for reinsurance collateral reduction, but only Florida and New York have approved any reinsurers for this. Following the GLBA, state insurance regulators through the NAIC began a regulatory modernization program in response to criticisms and the evolving financial services landscape. In 2000, NAIC members signed a Statement of Intent to modernize insurance regulation. New working groups were formed to address issues such as state privacy protections and speed to market of new insurance products. NAIC efforts post-GLBA include certification of 47 states as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws and adoption of heightened standards for reciprocity with 37 states. The System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) saw significant growth, with over 558,000 filings made in 2011. The System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) serves as a centralized platform for insurers to submit rate and form changes. It saw a significant increase in filings, with over 558,000 in 2011. The Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact aims to streamline regulatory processes for certain insurance lines and has been adopted by 41 states. The NAIC believes state regulators are better equipped to protect consumer interests in the insurance market. State regulators are emphasized as better suited to protect consumer interests in the insurance market. In 2010, state insurance departments had a total budget of nearly $1.3 billion, handling over 304,000 consumer complaints and 2.1 million inquiries. The NAIC supported federal efforts to address systemic risk while maintaining state-based insurance regulation. Recent changes include strengthening oversight of insurance holding companies and insurers' securities lending in response to the financial crisis. The NAIC made revisions to model laws on holding company oversight and increased oversight on insurers' securities lending, addressing issues highlighted by AIG during the financial crisis. They also reduced reliance on credit rating agencies and launched a \"Solvency Modernization Initiative\" to consider international standards for U.S. insurance regulation. In 2008, the Treasury released a Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, aiming for a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework for financial services. The 2008 Treasury model proposed a regulatory structure for financial services, including a prudential regulator, a business conduct regulator, and a market stability regulator. It recommended the creation of a federal insurance regulator for an optional federal charter and federal licensing for agents and brokers. President Obama's Financial Regulatory Reform Plan included the establishment of an \"Office of Insurance Oversight\" in the Department of the Treasury to address international regulatory issues and advise on insurance matters. Obama's Financial Regulatory Reform Plan, released in June 2009, outlined changes to the financial regulatory system, including systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve and the creation of a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The plan did not focus on insurance regulation, leaving states with a primary role in that area. The President's plan included systemic risk regulation by the Federal Reserve and the creation of a new Office of National Insurance within the Treasury. Companies engaging in financial activities could be designated as Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies subject to stringent standards. The draft legislation proposed the designation of Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies subject to stringent solvency standards and enhanced resolution authority. It was unclear how the Federal Reserve would interact with state regulators of insurance subsidiaries. The creation of an Office of National Insurance could have a broader impact, serving as a federal overseer for the insurance industry. The Office of National Insurance was intended to oversee insurance at the federal level, set policy, and represent the US internationally. Unenacted legislation in the 111th Congress included the Insurance Industry Competition Act of 2009, which aimed to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the insurance business. The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 1880) aimed to create a federal charter for the insurance industry, establishing a federal regulatory entity under the Department of the Treasury. This would have allowed nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers to operate nationwide without being subject to individual state insurance laws. No further action was taken on the bill introduced by Representatives Melissa Bean and Edward Royce in 2009. H.R. 1880 aimed to create a federal charter for the insurance industry, allowing nationwide operation without state law requirements. It also addressed systemic risk by designating a regulator. H.R. 2554, introduced by Representative David Scott, aimed to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers but did not pass the Senate. H.R. 2554, introduced by Representative David Scott, aimed to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB), a private nonprofit corporation allowing licensed insurance producers to operate in any state upon payment of licensing fees. NARAB would be subject to state regulations but would preempt laws treating out-of-state producers differently. The board overseeing NARAB would consist of appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners, with the President having the power to dissolve the board or suspend its actions. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) was introduced by Representative Dennis Moore to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups. It would have changed enforcement mechanisms, added federal corporate governance requirements, and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to issue determinations on state regulations. The Federal License for Reinsurers Act of 2010 (H.R. 6529) introduced by Representative Dennis Moore aimed to create a federal license for reinsurers, with regulatory authority resting with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General. Corporate governance standards included independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited service provider contracts. Amendments to the LRRA would expand consumer disclosure and impose a fiduciary duty on risk retention group directors. H.R. 6529 aimed to create a federal license for reinsurers under the authority of the FIO, allowing it to preempt state laws deemed inconsistent with federal law. No hearings or markups were held on the bill."
