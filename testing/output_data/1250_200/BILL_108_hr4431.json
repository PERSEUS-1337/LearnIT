The Congress finds a shortage of qualified foster and adoptive parents, with a decrease in foster parents despite an increase in children in foster care. There is a significant need for post-adoption services due to the rise in adoptions from foster care. One Church, One Child is a national foster care and adoption ministry founded in 1980 in Chicago, Illinois. It aims to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive, foster, and kinship families. Despite its success, the organization receives limited federal funding. A federally-funded grant program is needed to support the recruitment of foster and adoptive parents. Establishing and expanding programs for recruiting foster and adoptive parents based on the One Church, One Child concept will increase the pool of qualified parents for abused and neglected children.
