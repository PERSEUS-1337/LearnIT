    "content": "Federal government agencies and programs use various public policy approaches such as federal spending, tax laws, tax expenditures, and regulation to achieve their missions. In FY2004, federal spending was $2.3 trillion, tax expenditures were around $1 trillion, and estimates of off-budget costs of federal regulations have been in the hundreds of billions. Evaluating the performance of government activities is challenging due to disagreements among political actors on the use of public funds, program goals, and criteria for success. Disagreements among political actors on public fund use, program goals, and evaluation criteria make assessing government program performance challenging. Federal programs' multiple purposes can conflict, making it controversial to balance priorities. Some program outcomes are hard to measure, with a time lag between actions and results. In the last 50 years, Congress and the President have made efforts to analyze and manage the federal government's performance through initiatives like performance management, performance budgeting, and program evaluation. The Bush Administration's release of PART ratings and budget proposals aimed to use performance information to influence budget and management decisions for agencies and programs. The PART, part of the Bush Administration's Budget and Performance Integration initiative, evaluates programs to assess their effectiveness. It aims to have performance information considered in funding decisions and assesses programs with associated funding. The Administration submitted around 400 PART scores with budget proposals to evaluate programs totaling 20% of the federal budget annually for five years. The Bush Administration's PART initiative evaluates programs to assess effectiveness and integrate performance information into funding decisions. Around 400 PART scores were submitted with budget proposals to evaluate programs totaling 20% of the federal budget annually for five years. The Administration aimed to implement the objectives of the Government Performance and Results Act through the PART, which was controversial due to perceived lack of integration with GPRA. The Bush Administration's PART initiative evaluates programs for effectiveness and integrates performance information into funding decisions. OMB developed seven versions of the PART questionnaire with approximately 30 questions divided into four sections. Each section provides an \"effectiveness\" rating, which is then averaged to create a single PART score based on program purpose, design, strategic planning, program management, and program results/accountability. Some observers recommend stronger integration between PART and GPRA for better executive and congressional management reform efforts. The Bush Administration's PART initiative evaluates programs for effectiveness by assigning weights to program purpose and design, strategic planning, program management, and program results/accountability. OMB and agency staff negotiate and complete a questionnaire for each program to determine its PART scores. Disagreements are resolved by OMB political appointees and the White House. The definition of a program for PART assessment is often determined by a budgetary perspective. The PART process evaluates programs based on effectiveness by assigning weights to program purpose, design, strategic planning, management, and results. The definition of a program for assessment is often determined by a budgetary perspective, using the formal budget structure of accounts and activities. The term program activity is defined as activities and projects financed by a budget account. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) evaluates programs based on effectiveness using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). Each program is assessed based on a budget-centered approach outlined in the President's annual budget proposal. OMB develops a one-page \"Program Summary\" and a detailed worksheet for each program, displaying scores for four sections. These scores are used to generate an overall effectiveness rating of Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate, or Ineffective. Programs without acceptable performance measures are also evaluated. The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) assigns programs an overall qualitative rating of Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate, or Ineffective based on performance data. OMB does not publish numeric scores but uses them to determine qualitative ratings. The only explicitly defined rating is \"Results Not Demonstrated.\" The Government Accountability Office emphasizes the importance of using PART information effectively. The Government Accountability Office emphasizes interpreting the 'results not demonstrated' designation as 'unknown effectiveness' rather than 'ineffective.' OMB's rating categories for the PART are based on overall quantitative scores, aiming for transparency and objectivity in the process. Feedback was solicited from various stakeholders to improve the instrument before its publication with the President's FY2004 budget proposal. OMB made changes to the PART instrument before its publication with the President's FY2004 budget proposal. To increase transparency, detailed PART worksheets were made available for each program. OMB established formal criteria for assessing programs and differentiated among different types of programs. Subjectivity was minimized by eliminating certain questions, although OMB acknowledged that complete objectivity is unattainable. NAPA reviewed OMB's assessments for consistency. OMB acknowledges that subjectivity cannot be completely eliminated in assessments, even with tools like the PART. The process aims to be transparent by posing questions in advance for discussion. Subjectivity can come from various sources, not just OMB staff, including White House and political appointees. OMB notes that performance measurement has limitations and must be supplemented with evaluation data for a comprehensive understanding. Performance measurement must be coupled with evaluation data to understand why results occur and the value a program adds. It raises fundamental questions but doesn't provide definitive answers. OMB's PART relies on objective data to assess programs, aiming for an ideology-free evaluation of what works. PART ratings are intended to inform budget decisions but don't automatically determine funding. OMB stated that PART ratings are meant to inform budget decisions but do not automatically result in funding decisions. The PART process aims to improve program performance by linking performance to budget decisions and providing recommendations for improvement. The President's budget proposals for FY2004 and FY2005 were influenced by the PART process, showing a correlation between PART scores and funding changes. The Performance Institute supported the President's Management Agenda and highlighted the correlation between PART scores and funding changes in FY '05. The President's budget proposals for FY2005 included average increases for \"Effective\" and \"Moderately Effective\" programs, while \"Ineffective\" programs saw average decreases. The PART process improved performance management and outcome measures for programs, serving as a quality control tool for GPRA. Congress was encouraged to engage in the PART process. Some critics viewed PART as a blunt instrument, while others, like Harry R. Hatry, offered a mixed assessment. Scholars have analyzed the PART using statistical techniques, including regression analysis, to study the role of merit and political considerations in program evaluation. Harry R. Hatry, a program evaluation expert, believes that while the administration is making efforts to evaluate programs, it is challenging to determine the effectiveness of federal expenditures. He emphasizes the importance of examining program outcomes and linking spending decisions to this information, but acknowledges the limitations of the PART initiative in fully capturing program impacts. Despite his enthusiasm for enhancing budget-making processes, Hatry recognizes that political motives heavily influence spending decisions in Washington. Scholars have analyzed the PART using regression analysis to study the influence of merit and politics on budget recommendations. They found that higher PART scores correlated with higher proposed budget increases, with some evidence of political influence in FY2004. Additionally, PART scores seemed to have an impact on small and medium-sized programs, but not on large programs. The PART is considered a form of performance budgeting, although there is no standard definition for this term. Performance budgeting, involving the use of performance information and program evaluations during the budget process, has been supported by scholars. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to use this information effectively. In state governments, the development and use of performance measures have been considered somewhat effective but not a panacea for effecting changes. Many practitioners find the process of developing measures useful for management and decision-making, but few are enthusiastic about its impact. Performance measurement is seen as somewhat effective but not enthusiastically embraced by key players. Few are willing to link performance measures to changes in appropriation levels. Legislative budget officers rank the use of performance measures low in cost savings and reducing duplicative services. Implementation of performance measures has improved communication between agency personnel and the budget office. A scholar criticizes performance budgeting as having a disappointing past and uncertain future. GAO studied how OMB used the PART for the FY2004 budget. The GAO studied the PART's impact on OMB's decision-making process for the President's FY2004 budget request. The PART helped structure how performance information was used but had limited direct links to funding decisions. It was more beneficial for program improvement rather than resource allocation. GAO highlighted that the PART was not well integrated with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The GAO found that OMB's intention to modify GPRA goals with those developed under the PART has raised concerns among agency officials. OMB's influence on program goals is evident in recent guidance requiring agencies to submit a performance budget for fiscal year 2005, replacing the annual GPRA performance plan. While PART focuses on program-specific performance measurement, it does not replace GPRA's strategic, longer-term focus on thematic goals and crosscutting comparisons. Integrating the two frameworks is essential for effective performance planning and reporting. The GAO performed regression analysis on the Bush Administration's PART scores and funding recommendations. For discretionary programs, there was a statistically significant, positive relationship between PART scores and proposed budget changes, particularly for small programs. OMB made efforts to ensure consistency in program assessments for the PART. The GAO found that OMB made efforts to ensure consistency in program assessments for the PART, but there were issues with interpretation and judgment. Subjective terms in PART questions led to inconsistent responses, disagreements on performance measures resulted in some programs being labeled as \"Results Not Demonstrated,\" and a lack of performance information hindered program assessments. GAO recommended that OMB take actions to address these issues. OMB is working on improving agency implementation of PART recommendations and reporting progress to Congress. They aim to enhance PART guidance, clarify resource allocation expectations, engage in dialogue with congressional committees, and integrate GPRA with PART. OMB Deputy Director Clay Johnson III expressed commitment to making PART more credible and useful. GAO suggested a more systematic approach for Congress to articulate performance goals. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested a more systematic approach for Congress to articulate performance goals and outcomes for key programs. This includes establishing a communication vehicle for goals, developing a structured oversight agenda, and using it to inform authorization, oversight, and appropriations processes. This aims to increase the usefulness of the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in budget deliberations and improve congressional understanding of priorities and concerns. The PART and other program evaluations are important for Congress during the budget process, oversight of federal agencies, and legislation related to program evaluation. Three key criteria are validity, reliability, and objectivity. Validity measures if an instrument measures what it's intended to, reliability measures consistency in measurements, and objectivity ensures impartiality. These standards are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of federal programs. The reliability of the PART is determined by the consistency of assessments when applied to the same program. Objectivity is defined as pursuing an inquiry to maximize true conclusions, with concepts of fairness and absence of bias. Subjectivity implies bias or unfairness. Judging the objectivity of the PART involves comparing the inquiry against a rational standard for true findings. These criteria are interrelated, as subjective application may lead to inconsistent or unreliable results, indicating a lack of validity or proper implementation. The reliability and objectivity of assessments using the PART instrument are crucial for determining program effectiveness. Different views exist on the validity and reliability of the PART, with concerns raised about its usage and determinations. Further analysis is needed to address inconsistencies and ensure valid, reliable, and objective evaluations. The Administration designated nearly 50% of programs as \"results not demonstrated\" due to disagreements on assessing program performance. Different conceptions of program goals and measures raise questions about validity. Stakeholder perspectives may vary, impacting assessments. Stakeholder participation under GPRA is required but less certain under PART. Other issues identified by GAO question the validity and reliability of the PART instrument in assessing program effectiveness. The text discusses issues with the objectivity of program assessment, citing examples of potential subjectivity in PART questions. Terms lacking clear definitions can lead to varied interpretations, raising concerns about the instrument's objectivity and ratings. The PART assessment tool can raise questions about objectivity due to varying interpretations. Despite efforts to minimize subjectivity, it remains present in the process. The implementation of PART seems to centralize program goal debates within the executive branch."
