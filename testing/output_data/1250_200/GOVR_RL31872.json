    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined by the Department of Defense as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. They are used in military operations and have advantages and disadvantages compared to manned aircraft. Advantages of UAVs include eliminating risk to pilots' lives, aeronautical capabilities not limited by humans, and potentially lower procurement and operating costs. However, they have a higher crash risk and pose dangers when sharing airspace with manned aircraft. The growth in UAV employment is attributed to advancements in navigation and communication technology, as well as a decrease in the preference for manned aviation over unmanned options. The \"silk scarf syndrome\" preference for manned aviation over unmanned has decreased as UAVs have become mainstream. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, with the United States first testing them during the Vietnam War. The Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were later integrated into the US inventory. This led to increased funding for UAVs in the Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget, marking a transition from experimental to operational use in the US. The Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget requested higher levels of UAV funding, marking the transition of UAVs in the United States from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The Predator and Global Hawk UAVs were utilized in conflicts like Operation Desert Storm and Afghanistan, showcasing their value in surveillance and armed reconnaissance missions. Currently, the US inventory includes five major UAVs: Pioneer, Global Hawk, Predator, Hunter, and Shadow. Congress has shown growing support and investment in UAV technology. Investment in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been increasing annually, with Congress showing support for UAVs. The Pentagon requested $1.6 billion for UAV procurement and development in FY2006. Congress has directed joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and has required a UAV roadmap from the Department of Defense. In 1996, Congress supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter UAVs, but DOD opposed the initiative. The House Armed Services Committee supported legislation in 1996 to weaponize the Predator and Hunter UAVs, despite DOD opposition. Congress has confidence in UAV technology, predicting one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft to be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, raising questions on cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. Congress may assess DOD's UAV efforts to ensure alignment with new investment goals and strategies. UAVs have evolved beyond traditional roles of reconnaissance and surveillance, with potential to replace manned aircraft in various missions. Congress may need to consider replacing a significant portion of manned aircraft with unmanned ones. The introduction of UAVs in large numbers could raise personnel issues related to recruitment and retention, especially given the operational stresses of the Global War on Terrorism. The impact of widespread deployment of UAVs on military personnel and industrial base issues need to be considered. Concerns about the proliferation of UAV systems in the international marketplace may require steps to control their spread. Congress may need to balance supporting legitimate U.S. exports with curbing the spread of UAV technologies to dangerous groups or countries. The development and proliferation of UAV technologies are increasing, with a variety of designs and applications. Congress may need to evaluate the management of UAVs, including their development speed and incorporation into military capabilities. UAV programs range in size and range, from small Micro UAVs to large Global Hawks. The inventory of UAVs has significantly expanded, with 604 UAVs compared to 163 in 2003. The inventory of UAVs has significantly expanded from 163 in 2003 to 604 UAVs, including second-generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER. The increase is driven by rising demand for UAVs for various missions beyond intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications. The inventory of UAVs has significantly expanded to include Predator B with strike capability and Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems targeting air defenses. DOD's UAV research and development funding has grown due to UAVs being a growth industry and relatively inexpensive to produce. R&D funding in FY2006 for UAVs is more than double the total procurement funding, suggesting accelerated acquisition of UAVs in the future. Comparing manned aircraft inventories to unmanned inventories can provide insight into the pace and scope of UAV acquisition. The comparison between manned aircraft inventories and unmanned inventories shows that despite the recent acceleration in UAV production, manned aircraft still represent 95% of all DoD aircraft. UAVs are seen as complements to manned aircraft rather than replacements. The pace of UAV production is expected to continue or accelerate in the coming years, with recommendations to accelerate their introduction into the force structure. The Air Force plans to grow UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, with former Air Force Chief of Staff indicating a faster pace of UAV production. The Air Force plans to increase UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, with General John Jumper pushing for faster production of Predators. Congress has urged the DoD to speed up UAV acquisition, with goals set for unmanned deep strike aircraft. Some in the 109th Congress advocate for more UAV procurement for non-military roles. Some in the 109th Congress advocate for increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military roles, such as border security. However, there are concerns about the DoD's enthusiasm leading to a lack of clear direction for the future of UAVs. Critics worry that a fast pace of development could compromise quality and efficiency, making congressional oversight more challenging. Representative Curt Weldon cautions against aggressively fielding new UAVs without addressing fundamental issues to ensure they are designed and deployed effectively. Some services are purchasing expensive UAVs without proper authorization or appropriations, while others are leasing UAV services for combat operations using maintenance funds. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to a crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to \"immaturity\" of critical technologies. A deceleration in pace and management changes are recommended to maintain quality and efficiency. The report recommends a deceleration in pace and management changes for the Global Hawk program to maintain quality and efficiency. Congress seeks assurances on taxpayer spending for UAV programs and has introduced measures to regulate procurement without proper approval. One crucial Congressional task is to assess the effectiveness of DoD's administrative processes and lines of authority in UAV development and acquisition. The management of DoD's acquisition programs has been under scrutiny, with concerns about duplication of effort and calls for centralization of UAV acquisition authority. Cost management is also a key issue, as UAVs are developed and procured through the same system as manned aircraft. Some fear that competition and innovation may be repressed in UAV development and procurement due to cost issues. UAVs are now rivaling manned aircraft in cost, with the Global Hawk program estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft. Cost growth is attributed to factors like mission creep and inconsistent management practices, such as adding multiple sensors that increase weight and require larger wings and engines, driving up costs. The Global Hawk UAV program has seen cost increases due to the addition of multiple sensors, larger wings, and more powerful engines. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has also experienced cost growth, with over $1 billion cut from its budget and management shifted to the Air Force, potentially leading to higher costs per aircraft. The frequent changes in management and realignment of organizations involved in UAV development highlight the challenges in establishing a coherent direction. The management of UAV programs has faced challenges with frequent changes in organizations and realignment. The Joint Program Office (JPO) and Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) were established but faced criticism and little progress. DARO was disbanded in 1998 due to problems, redesigns, and accidents. Since DARO's disbandment in 1998, there has been no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. General oversight authority is with OASD(C3I), while services manage program development. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force was established in 2001 to coordinate UAV programs and standardize development. Many in the defense community see it as the top UAV management authority. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001, is seen as the top UAV management authority in the defense community. Dr. Glenn Lamartin from the OSD emphasized the task force's role in instituting requirements and providing structure to UAV programs. Despite its efforts, Congressional concerns regarding UAV acquisition management and program duplication persist. Additionally, other management mechanisms, such as UAV Roadmaps and the U.S. Joint Forces Command's experimentation, have been initiated to further advance UAV-related efforts. In 2003, management mechanisms were initiated to enhance UAV interoperability and flexibility. The DoD created the UAV Interoperability Working Group for joint-service cooperation. The JROC established a UAV Special Studies Group for advisory purposes. In 2005, OSD considered appointing an executive agent for UAV programs, but later opted for two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. In late June 2005, the DoD abandoned the idea of an executive agent for UAV programs in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) addresses major interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence enhances UAV applications through technology examination and coordination. The constant organizational changes have raised concerns about UAV management, indicating a lack of a final development and oversight structure to meet military needs. The DoD has not finalized a UAV development and oversight structure. The establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is seen as a step in the right direction following criticism from the GAO for lacking oversight. The UAV Center of Excellence aims to streamline UAV operations and technology utilization. The UAV Center of Excellence serves as a one-stop shop for exploring common operating systems and optimal UAV usage. Questions may arise regarding final management authority within these bodies or the services. Congress may need to address these issues in the future. The Joint UAV Task Force has released roadmaps to guide the future roles, technological progress, and investment needs of UAVs. The GAO has called for a binding strategic plan from the Department of Defense. The GAO called for a binding strategic plan from the Department of Defense in 2005, prior to the release of the updated UAS Roadmap. The Roadmap provides guidance on standards development and interoperability solutions, but does not authorize specific UAS or prioritize requirements. This lack of an authoritative blueprint for UAV development paths may lead to debate on future management. The DoD's approach to the Roadmap's authority and the GAO's strategic UAV plan will spark debate on future UAV management. Congress may reassess GAO recommendations and the Roadmap mandate to integrate UAVs into warfighting capabilities. Developing a DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and balancing cost with capability. Key questions include quantifying UAV cost, balancing spending between UAVs and manned aircraft, and maximizing UAV capabilities through strategic investments. Quantifying UAV cost is a complex task for the UAV community. Two main cost descriptions are flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances. PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost highlights cost efficiency challenges in UAV management. The cost of UAVs can be misleading as it includes various supporting elements like ground control stations, ground crew, and communication links. Comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft requires considering the complete unmanned aviation system. Budgeting conventions also complicate monitoring UAV costs, with different services categorizing UAV funding requests differently. UAV funding requests are included in different accounts in the budget documentation of the Air Force and Army. The costs of UAVs are spread across various budgets, making it challenging to determine the total expenses. Congress may need to find a balance between spending on UAVs and manned aircraft. The projected spending on UAVs from 2001-2010 is expected to exceed $18 billion, significantly higher than the previous decade. The funding for UAVs from 2001-2010 is projected to exceed $18 billion, surpassing the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. The Presidential Budget Requests indicate a potential increase in funding for the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System to over $1 billion by FY2011. Despite this, UAV funding remains under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of the total funding. The cost savings of unmanned aircraft over manned aircraft are often negligible due to expenses related to ground control stations and training of UAV operators. UAVs have a higher attrition rate and lower reliability rate, leading to potentially higher operation and maintenance costs compared to manned aircraft. However, UAV ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, partially offsetting the cost disadvantage. Control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, somewhat restoring cost advantage to unmanned systems. Studies show replacing manned helicopters with UCAVs may not save significant costs. DoD found development costs similar but savings in procurement costs comparing F-16 to UCAV. DoD faces challenge of balancing cost and capability between manned and unmanned vehicles. Rising price tag of some UAVs is a concern for OSD. The rising cost of UAVs is a significant concern, with sensors contributing to the increased expenses. The cost of sensor payloads for UAVs like Global Hawk is a substantial portion of the overall cost, driven by high demand and limited competition in the market. The rising cost of UAVs due to sensor expenses has led to two schools of thought for UAV employment: one advocates for many smaller, less expensive UAVs in a highly interconnected network, while the other suggests fewer, more expensive, and more capable UAVs like the Global Hawk. The Global Hawk, a high altitude surveillance platform, has faced delays and funding cuts. Key areas for UAV investment include interoperability, reliability, autonomy, and engine systems. Concerns over slow progress in interoperability have been highlighted by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is concerned about the slow progress in UAV interoperability, which could lead to decreased effectiveness in missions. Improving UAV communication between each other and with ground components is crucial for future battlefield operations. Advancing UAV interoperability is a critical part of the OSD's investment plans. The DoD aims to establish inter-communication between UAVs in four categories: situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. Despite the framework being in place, technology development has been slow. The House of Representatives took steps to encourage inter-platform cooperation. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) included a clause requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap aims to expand this communication system to all large UAVs. To achieve interoperability, investment in the Common Data Link system is crucial. The expansion of UAV applications may be hindered by limited bandwidth, leaving many platforms grounded. The increased use of UAVs in wars highlights the need for a more robust information transfer system due to bandwidth constraints. Representative Curt Weldon noted that many UAVs sit idle due to inadequate bandwidth for effective use. The limited bandwidth in Iraq and Afghanistan hinders the operations of some UAVs. The Transformation Satellite Communications project aims to provide unlimited communication capacity, but funding cutbacks may delay deployment until 2015-2016. Increasing UAV autonomy could reduce bandwidth usage, but the effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs to address mishap rates that could impede widespread fielding. One solution to alleviate bandwidth issues is operating UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This approach also addresses pilot manpower and retention concerns by allowing pilots to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. Experimentation is ongoing in controlling UAV sensor payload from the air. The 2005 UAS Roadmap highlights high UAV mishap rates compared to manned aircraft. The Defense Science Board notes that advancements in system design and reliability have reduced manned aircraft mishap rates. However, UAVs like Predator and Global Hawk were rushed into combat before reaching full operational capability. The 2005 UAS Roadmap highlights high UAV mishap rates compared to manned aircraft. Predator and Global Hawk were rushed into combat before reaching full operational capability. Investments in emerging technologies and advanced materials are expected to improve UAV reliability and survivability in adverse environments. One technological priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously. At the 2003 Paris Airshow, Boeing's Mike Heinz emphasized the need to reduce operator workload by enabling one operator to control multiple UAVs. Currently, most UAVs require two ground operators, but the goal is to have a 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy for one operator to control multiple vehicles. This advancement could significantly enhance UAVs as a force-multiplier on the battlefield, but it would require significant time and investment to achieve. Investing in autonomous flight capabilities of UAVs is crucial to reduce operator workload and enable one operator to control multiple vehicles. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle have automated flight capabilities, but their level of autonomy is debatable. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with a level of at least eight needed for maximum use by a single pilot. Achieving this level of autonomy would require significant investments in control technologies. The Global Hawk UAV currently has an ACL of 2.5, while plans for the J-UCAS combat UAV aim for an ACL of six. The goal is to develop \"see and avoid\" technology to increase the standard ACL for UAVs to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for autonomous flight capabilities. The Air Force has already evaluated a Predator upgrade that allows one operator to control up to four UAVs. The Air Force recently evaluated a Predator upgrade that enables one operator to control up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. The next step is to consolidate the tasks of the four mission payload operators into one or fewer operators. Investment in heavy fuel burning engines is a priority according to the OSD's Unmanned Aviation System Roadmap. The Defense Science Board recommended investing in heavy fuel engines for Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout UAVs due to the lack of commercial demand for these engines. Enrique J. Enriguez, President of Locust USA, Inc., testified about the military's need for heavy fuel burning engines for UAVs. The incorporation of heavy fuel engines could improve UAV performance, reduce servicing time, and lower operation costs. However, there may be drawbacks when applying heavy fuel engines to UAVs. Targeted platforms for this engine are medium-sized and less complex UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Fire Scout. The use of heavy fuel engines in UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator could reduce operation costs but may increase production costs due to higher acquisition costs. Developers are facing challenges in designing engines light and small enough for lighter UAVs. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell that could double efficiency and reduce detection and targeting risks. Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project with a flight test expected in 2010. The DoD is facing questions about its coherent plan for UAV roles and applications, including whether UAVs are being applied to new roles aggressively enough. Most UAVs are currently used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, with projections that this will continue to be the dominant role until at least 2014. In 2003, all of DoD's major UAV programs were for ISR missions, while in 2005, 87 percent of programs are designed for ISR. There is concern about potential duplication with rapid growth in ISR UAVs. Congress questions the need for new UAV programs when existing ones have similar sensors but differ in altitude, range, endurance, and procedures. Congress may intervene to determine when new UAV programs are justified. In the future, Congress may decide on the justification for new UAV programs based on their performance specifications and potential duplication concerns. Critics argue that producing UAVs with similar capabilities is unnecessary, suggesting a consolidated inventory could fulfill the same duties. However, proponents believe that varied platform inventory is essential as basic performance capabilities alone do not determine the necessity of UAVs. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased. The majority of UAVs are now equipped with various munitions, and there are ongoing efforts to create UAVs primarily designed for offensive applications. Using UAVs for air-to-ground munitions delivery is seen as inherently useful. The J-UCAS program aims to develop the first UAV for offensive applications, with UAVs being able to deliver air-to-ground munitions effectively. Cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft are crucial in determining the best option for combat operations. The MQ-9 Predator B costs $11.7 million, while the F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million, with the F-16 carrying four times the payload of the Predator B. Manned aircraft like the F-16 may generally be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat due to their versatility in performing various missions. The use of UAVs in air-to-ground combat may be less cost-effective compared to manned aircraft like the F-16. UAVs have unique combat capabilities that are valuable in niche circumstances. UAVs are also being considered for missions such as electronic attack, psychological operations, and medical supply delivery on the battlefield. Additionally, there is growing interest in using UAVs for homeland defense and security, with plans to deploy them for coastal surveillance and border protection. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security. Interest is growing in using UAVs for various domestic roles, such as law enforcement surveillance, security monitoring, and disaster response. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to be used for small-package transport by local law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs could also be utilized in sparsely populated areas to search for forest fires and assist in post-disaster situations like Hurricane Katrina. UAVs like Global Hawk could play roles in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts post-disaster. Countries like South Korea and Japan have used UAVs for agricultural purposes. FAA regulations and UAV flight requirements need to align for UAVs to take an active role in homeland security. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003, marking progress towards reconciliation of discrepancies. Upgrading UAVs collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching UAV-airspace common ground. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group will collaborate with the Department of Defense to enhance UAV collision avoidance capabilities and ensure safe UAV operations in national airspace. Integrating UAVs into the airspace may face challenges, with concerns raised about funding for programs like Access 5. Additionally, there is potential for large UAVs to take on aerial refueling tasks currently performed by tanker aircraft. Large UAVs could potentially take on the aerial refueling task currently done by KC-10 and KC-135 tanker aircraft. DOD has not expressed plans for this role, but it seems well-suited for unmanned aircraft. The Global Hawk has already demonstrated the ability to perform missions similar to aerial refueling. There are also experiments to equip UAVs with sensors and weapons for air-to-air combat, with reports of a Predator engaging in such combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. The Predator engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This development may signal a step towards UAVs taking on more aggressive missions. Other options for new roles include manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Defense contractors are competing to develop unmanned blimps capable of floating at high altitudes for extended periods. The OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms for various roles like psychological operations, missile spotting, and border monitoring. These platforms could offer similar services as border surveillance UAVs but with lower fuel dependency. However, they lack maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to develop operational systems by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites are seen as invulnerable to attack with advanced capabilities, but tasking them can be challenging due to limited systems and loitering capability. The high costs of space launches have led to considering UAVs like Global Hawk as substitutes for low-orbiting satellite constellations. Critics warn that mass UAV production may lead to a degradation of pilot skills and tactical flexibility in combat operations. The aviation culture is adapting to flying aircraft from the ground, with efforts to encourage pilots to see piloting UAVs as a major mission. The Air Force is encouraging pilots to view piloting UAVs as a significant mission, offering incentives to retain rated pilots. While concerns exist about the impact of increased UAV use on recruitment and retention, the situation varies among the services. The Army faces recruitment challenges, while the Air Force and Navy are actively reducing their personnel numbers. The potential impact of increased UAV use on enlistments may not have the anticipated effect. The increased use of UAVs may not have the expected impact on enlistments, as different services have varying requirements for UAV operators. Some individuals may be attracted to enlisting due to the opportunity to operate UAVs, especially if they are unable to fly manned aircraft. Flying armed UAVs could be more appealing to some personnel, offering a compromise between the excitement of flying manned aircraft and the practicality of operating UAVs. The Air Force believes that flying UAVs from control stations in the United States will be attractive to some Reservists and Guardsmen who may already be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft. Not all UAVs compete with manned aircraft for pilots, as some are pre-programmed and operate autonomously. The Air Force maintains that their UAVs are more technologically and operationally sophisticated, requiring a trained pilot for effective operation. As UAV autonomy matures, there may be a review of the policy requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs, potentially boosting enlistment in other specialties. Increased use of UAVs could potentially attract more recruits to other specialties if they are seen as effective in missions, especially in providing improved force protection and CAS capabilities. Congress faces defense industrial base issues such as dependency on foreign suppliers, subsidies for foreign competitors, and promoting competition. The DoD's focus on UAVs raises concerns about potential funding cuts for manned aircraft programs. The debate over the impact of increasing UAV development on manned aircraft programs and the defense industrial base continues. Some argue that focusing on UAVs could erode the technical expertise needed for manned combat aircraft, while others believe the industry is naturally evolving towards advanced UAVs. Concerns exist that concentrating solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. Some proponents argue that UAVs are not likely to replace manned aircraft soon, but others believe that skills and technologies for building manned aircraft can be applied to unmanned aviation design. Major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive, as UAVs are playing a prominent role in warfare. Companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman Corp. are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters for growth opportunities. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman Corp. are focusing on unmanned aircraft for growth opportunities. The global UAV market is projected to double from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014, with U.S. companies needing to compete effectively to maintain a strong defense industrial base. The UAV market is expected to generate new business, and if U.S. companies do not capture this market share, competitors from Europe, Russia, Israel, China, or South Africa will. The global UAV market is projected to double from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. U.S. companies need to capture this market share to stay competitive. The growth of UAVs raises concerns about proliferation and export controls, as components are easily diverted for covert programs. The proliferation of UAVs raises concerns about diverting technology for covert programs, making them accessible to various actors. They are seen as cost-effective weapons, posing a threat that is more expensive to defend against than to create. The potential military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands has been a concern, with fears of them becoming a \"poor man's air force.\" Foreign companies gaining access to key technologies could enhance UAV capabilities, prompting policymakers to be vigilant. Foreign companies are gaining access to key technologies for future UAVs, raising concerns about potential exports of critical UAV technologies. Policy makers need to address issues related to UAV proliferation and its consequences, balancing military aid to allies with concerns about weapon system proliferation. UAVs are effective for ISR, enabling precise military force use and reducing accidental targeting. Overseers must consider the implications of these advancements. The section discusses the potential benefits of UAVs in reducing collateral damage and the need for tighter controls on UAV proliferation. It also addresses the program status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense. Small man-portable UAVs are not weaponized and lack detailed cost documentation compared to major UAV programs. While popular with ground forces, they do not receive as much congressional attention as larger UAVs like Predator or Global Hawk. However, these smaller UAVs are expected to compete for funding and attention in the future. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is the most recognizable UAV used by the Department of Defense, known for its surveillance and armament capabilities. Its widespread use has led to the development of related UAVs. Predator, a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV, has seen accelerated development and increased procurement funding. It operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with the ability to reach 25,000 feet, and can stay on station for 24 hours. The Air Force's Predator fleet is operated by multiple squadrons in Nevada, with the CIA also reportedly operating several Predators. Its primary mission is reconnaissance and target acquisition. The Predator UAV is primarily used for reconnaissance and target acquisition, equipped with surveillance payloads including electro-optical and infrared cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System, and synthetic aperture radar. It also has satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations and the ability to carry Hellfire missiles for precision attacks. The MQ-9 Predator, or \"Predator B\", is General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1, or \"Predator A\". It is a medium-to-high altitude, long endurance UAV optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. Upgrades include a longer length and wingspan, as well as a more powerful engine. The Predator B, or MQ-9, features a 900hp turbo propjet engine, allowing for a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, speed of 225 knots, endurance of 32 hours, and range of 2000 nautical miles. It can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons. Additionally, it can launch a mini-UAV called \"Silent Eyes\" for target identification. The Predator B-ER, \"Mariner\", is a hybrid UAV developed by General Atomics for the Navy's BAMS program. It combines features from the Predator B and NASA's Altair UAV, with an 86 ft. wing and increased fuel capacity. The Mariner can fly at altitudes of 50,000 feet for 49 hours and is equipped with a maritime radar for advanced surveillance capabilities. General Atomics is also developing the Predator C with a turbo-jet engine for long endurance, high altitude missions. General Atomics is developing the Predator C, a third-generation UAV with a turbo-jet engine for long endurance, high altitude surveillance missions. It will have a similar payload capacity and flight performance to Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk. The I-Gnat-ER, a medium altitude, long-endurance surveillance platform, is a downsized version of the Predator UAV with similar characteristics but lacks SAR and BLOS capabilities. The I-Gnat-ER UAV can fly for 30 hours, longer than its Air Force counterpart, but with limited capabilities and shorter flight radius. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles and is expecting two more with advanced features. The Predator UAV system includes four air vehicles, a ground control station, and a Predator Primary Satellite Link. The cost for a Predator A system in FY2005 was $18.0 million, while a Predator B system cost $46.8 million. The Air Force has 57 MQ-1 Predators and plans to increase the inventory of MQ-9 Predator Bs to 46. The Air Force has 57 MQ-1 Predators and plans to increase the inventory of MQ-9 Predator Bs to 46. General John Jumper emphasized the importance of building more Predators. The initial operation capability of the Predator B has been delayed to FY2009 to ensure proper infrastructure and strategies are in place. Congressional funding for Predator R&D and Procurement has increased, with research into integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions on the Predator in FY2006. In FY2006, Senate Authorizers supported research into integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions on the Predator UAV. The Pioneer UAV, originally developed by Israeli Aircraft Industries, has served the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps for nearly twenty years. The Navy ended its use of the Pioneer in FY2002, passing its assets to the Marine Corps for continued operation until 2010. The Pioneer UAV, passed from the Navy to the Marine Corps in FY2002, is known for its durability and performance upgrades. It is 14 feet long, can reach 15,000 feet altitude, and has a flight range of 100 nautical miles. The propeller-driven UAV can stay aloft for up to five hours and has flown over 36,500 hours since 1986. The Pioneer UAV, known for its durability and performance upgrades, has flown over 36,500 hours since 1986. Its mission is to provide real-time intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities to field commanders, with a payload including an E-O/IR camera. The Navy planned to retire the Pioneer in 2004 but transferred all systems to the Marine Corps, which aims to keep them operational for another 10 years through a product improvement program. Current procurement funds focus on post-production support and upgrade kits. In FY2006, DoD's Pioneer procurement requests included funding for upgrade kits only. The Pioneer system, costing $17.2 million in FY2004 dollars, consists of five vehicles, a ground control station, and launch/recovery devices. The Marine Corps operates 35 Pioneer UAVs at various locations. Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest and most expensive UAV in operation for the Department of Defense, with advanced surveillance capabilities. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV plays a crucial role in ISR, but challenges in adding intelligence systems to its payload have hindered its progress. Concerns over costs have led to a slowdown in development until better program controls are in place. The UAV is 44 feet long, weighs 26,750 lbs, flies at high altitudes for long durations, and can cover vast distances. Despite being designed for autonomous operation, it often requires intervention by remote operators. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV, an upgraded version of the RQ-4A, has a larger airframe with increased length and wingspan. This allows it to carry an extra 1000 lbs of surveillance payload, providing persistent high-quality imagery valuable for surveillance and interdiction operations. The UAV features a multi-intelligence payload with sensors like SAR, MTI, digital camera, and IR sensor, making it a crucial asset for military commanders. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV, upgraded from the RQ-4A, has a larger airframe to carry more surveillance payload. It includes an open-system architecture for multiple intelligence sensors like SIGINT and ELINT. The addition of the MP-RTIP payload will enhance radar capabilities. Future plans involve hyper-spectral sensors and laser communications for increased precision and information transfer. The goal is to create a UAV network with space-based sensors to prevent tactical surprises.

Developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, the RQ-4A is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006. The Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. Currently, the Air Force has 12 RQ-4A vehicles with a program-unit cost of $128.7 million. The program had an 18% cost overrun due to increasing aircraft capacity for more sophisticated surveillance capabilities. The Global Hawk program experienced an 18% cost overrun due to increased aircraft capacity for advanced surveillance capabilities. A Government Accountability Office report in December 2004 highlighted a nearly $900 million cost increase since 2001, leading to recommendations to delay future Global Hawk purchases. Concerns over rising costs and Air Force mismanagement have sparked debates in Congress and the Pentagon, with the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticizing the Air Force for reallocating funds meant for a counter-drug surveillance program. This resulted in a recommended $18 million cut to the President's R&D request for the Global Hawk. The Global Hawk development program faced budget cuts in 2004, with reductions in R&D and procurement funding. Concerns over rising costs led to a restructuring plan in 2005 to address criticisms of the program's expenses compared to manned aircraft. The Air Force restructured the Global Hawk program in 2005 to address cost criticisms. Funding for the program was cut in FY2006, with increased R&D funding. The Army's Hunter UAV program, originally developed by Israel Aircraft Industries and TRW, has faced turbulence with plans to acquire 52 integrated systems canceled.
