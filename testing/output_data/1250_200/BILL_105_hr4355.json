The Congress finds that thousands of computer systems are not capable of recognizing dates after December 31, 1999, which could cripple essential systems. Prompt disclosure of Year 2000 readiness is crucial to minimize disruption to the economy and legal liability concerns exist. The Act aims to promote the free disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information to minimize economic disruption and legal liability concerns. Uniform legal standards are needed to facilitate timely disclosures and exchanges of such information. The Act aims to promote the free disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information to minimize economic disruption and legal liability concerns, establishing uniform legal principles for this purpose. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, the term \"Year 2000 statement\" refers to any statement related to assessments, projections, or estimates of Year 2000 processing capabilities, implementation plans, test results, or operational issues. The term \"statement\" means a disclosure of information by one party to another or to the public in any form or medium. The term \"Year 2000 processing\" refers to handling date data between the 20th and 21st centuries, including leap year calculations. The term \"Year 2000 Internet website\" denotes a website related to Year 2000 issues.

It also defines terms like \"covered action,\" \"republication,\" and \"consumer.\" The term \"consumer\" refers to an individual who purchases a consumer product for personal use, while a \"consumer product\" is any personal property or service used for personal, family, or household purposes. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR YEAR 2000 STATEMENTS. In covered actions based on allegedly false Year 2000 statements, the maker is not liable unless it is proven that the statement was material and made with knowledge of its falsity, intent to deceive, or gross negligence. In covered actions involving false Year 2000 statements, liability is only established if the statement was knowingly false or misleading. Posting a notice on a Year 2000 Internet website is considered adequate notice if no better method is available, but this does not change existing notice requirements or create new duties. In covered actions, liability for false Year 2000 statements requires clear evidence of knowing falsehood or recklessness. Year 2000 statements cannot amend written contracts or warranties in any covered action. The subsection addresses the amendment or alteration of written contracts or warranties, with exceptions for agreements in writing, Year 2000 statements during contract formation, and contracts allowing for amendment through Year 2000 statements. Existing law determines the impact of Year 2000 statements on contracts. Federal entities can request Year 2000 processing information as \"Special Year 2000 Data Gathering Requests.\" The subsection allows Federal entities to request Year 2000 processing information through \"Special Year 2000 Data Gathering Requests,\" which are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and cannot be used in civil actions. However, Federal entities can still obtain this information separately through other legal means. SEC. 5. EXCLUSIONS. This Act excludes consumer product statements, does not impact information disclosure authority, contracts, or duty of care for Year 2000 statements. The Act does not impose any new obligations on makers or publishers of Year 2000 statements under Federal or State law. It also does not affect trademark rights or preclude seeking injunctive relief for Year 2000 statements. APPLICABILITY: This Act applies to Year 2000 statements made between July 14, 1998, and July 14, 2001, and does not affect pending actions as of July 14, 1998."
