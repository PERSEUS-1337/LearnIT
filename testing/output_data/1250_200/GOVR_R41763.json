    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process, prompting interest in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. Efforts such as the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 aim to assess these costs and benefits, although it is challenging to accurately measure them. The difficulty in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits is highlighted, with challenges such as determining baselines and aggregating results from different studies. The Office of Advocacy within the Small Business Administration released a report in 2010 estimating the annual cost of federal regulations to be around $1.75 trillion, with previous reports in 1995, 2001, and 2005 estimating costs between $416 billion and $1.1 trillion. In 2001, W. Mark Crain and Hopkins estimated the annual cost of regulations in 2000 at $843 billion, and in 2005, Crain estimated annual regulatory costs in 2004 at about $1.1 trillion. The $1.75 trillion estimate of regulatory costs has been widely cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation and congressional oversight actions. Critics argue that the estimate overstates the total cost of federal regulations. Crain and Crain developed the $1.75 trillion estimate by adding cost estimates for economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations involving safety and security. The estimated cost of economic regulations was more than 70% of the total regulatory costs. Economic regulations include restrictions and incentives that affect businesses' operations, both domestically and internationally. Crain and Crain used a Worldwide Governance Index to estimate the cost of economic regulations. The WGI regulatory quality index, developed by Aart Kraay, Massimo Mastruzzi, and Daniel Kaufmann, measures governments' ability to implement policies for private sector development. The index ranges from -2.5 to +2.5, with +2.5 indicating minimal regulation. In 2008, the US scored +1.579. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to study the impact of changes in the index on GDP per capita, finding a 9.4% change for a one-unit index change. In 2008, Crain and Crain found that a one-unit change in the WGI regulatory quality index represented a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita in the United States. They estimated that economic regulations reduced GDP by about $1.236 trillion. The WGI index for the US in 2008 was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys scored on a 0 to 1 scale. The Economist Intelligence Unit, Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators, and Global Insight Global Risk Service are commercial business information providers that assess factors like protectionism, access to capital markets, tax effectiveness, legislation, export and import regulations. The curr_chunk discusses various business information providers and their respective scores based on expert judgments of different factors such as export/import regulations, business ownership restrictions, foreign investment, ease of starting a business, and competition regulation arrangements. The Heritage Foundation, Institutional Profiles Database, and Political Risk Services are among the organizations mentioned with their corresponding scores. The curr_chunk discusses the regulatory quality index developed from two surveys by Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide and Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook. The scores are based on factors like investment profile and business environment. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report evaluates various aspects of business environment, including administrative regulations, tax system, competition, and ease of starting a business. Some critics question the accuracy of WGI indices, but the authors have addressed these concerns by explaining the methodology behind the indices. The WGI indices, including the regulatory quality index, are useful for broad cross-country comparisons and trends over time, but may not be detailed enough for specific governance reforms in individual countries. Crain and Crain used the WGI regulatory quality index in their study due to its broader coverage and longer time span compared to the OECD index. The accuracy of estimating the cost of economic regulations by Crain and Crain depends on factors such as the validity of the WGI index. The validity and accuracy of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depend on whether the WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" can be used to measure regulatory costs. Aart Kraay from the World Bank pointed out issues with how the index was interpreted in their report. Kraay stated that the index measures perceptions of the overall quality of the regulatory environment, not the stringency of regulations. Kraay pointed out that the Regulatory Quality (RQ) index measures perceptions of the overall quality of the regulatory environment, not just stringency. He mentioned that the US ranks high globally, with countries like Finland and Sweden ahead. Kraay also highlighted the imprecision in WGI indicators and noted a misinterpretation of units by Crain and Crain. Kraay emphasized that the Regulatory Quality index measures the overall quality of the regulatory environment, not just stringency. He suggested comparing the US score with countries like Singapore and Denmark for a more relevant calibration of regulatory costs. This would result in smaller estimated costs due to the smaller distance between the US and Denmark compared to the US and a fixed score of 2.5 on the WGI. The difference in regulatory quality index between the US and Ireland suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP, amounting to about $448 billion in 2008. This is based on a regression analysis indicating a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita for a one-unit change in the regulatory quality index. The $448 billion reduction in GDP in 2008 is based on a regression analysis showing a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita for a one-unit change in the regulatory quality index. Kraay expressed concerns about the correlation between regulatory quality and GDP per capita, stating that it is difficult to separate the effects of regulation from other factors. Crain and Crain defended their use of the regulatory quality index, stating that it reflects changes in the stringency of regulation in practice. They emphasized that the index captures various stakeholders' perceptions of regulation and highlighted the questions used to construct it. Additionally, they explained their decision not to compare the United States to another country and clarified their interpretation of the WGI measure. The WGI measure ranges from -2.5 to +2.5, with +2.5 chosen as the best approximation of the regulatory environment. The Crain and Crain report was peer-reviewed by economists Bob Litan and Richard Williams. Litan found the study \"terrific,\" while Williams expressed concerns about the index of regulatory quality potentially overstating the costs of regulation. The study on regulatory costs may overestimate total costs due to the Regulatory Quality Index capturing effects of various regulations. However, there are concerns that the index may also underestimate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the study and requested the SBA's Office of Advocacy to withdraw its sponsorship. CPR highlighted that the WGI authors did not intend the index to be a proxy for regulatory burden. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. Economists believe that a country's standard of living is influenced by various factors, including resources, labor, technology, and trade opportunities. The report highlights concerns about the lack of a clear definition of \"economic regulations\" and the simplistic relationship assumed between regulatory \"stringency\" and GDP. It also notes that the index of regulatory quality in the United States is not as low as implied, as the US ranked 11th out of over 200 countries. Most economists believe that government interventions can impact a country's standard of living. Crain and Crain's report used regression analysis to study the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, considering factors like population, foreign trade, education, and broadband subscribers. Control variables may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita, and alternative measures could be more suitable. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, considering factors like population, foreign trade, education, and broadband subscribers. They used a non-standard estimation strategy on cross-country panel data, omitting statistically insignificant control variables. The authors did not provide their data for review. The sensitivity of the results in the Crain and Crain report was assessed by running a linear regression using different data and methods, showing that the regulatory quality index had no independent effect on GDP per capita. Economists suggest that the impact of economic regulation on a country's standard of living may be too subtle for a seven-year cross-country panel to capture, as regulatory environments evolve slowly and interact with various factors. More focused empirical tools may be needed to understand the relationship between regulatory quality and economic well-being. Crain and Crain developed cost estimates for environmental regulations following OMB's approach. They converted OMB's estimates into 2001 dollars and then to 2009 dollars, concluding that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. The authors concluded that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. They used the upper-end estimate of $280 billion, citing a lack of cost estimates for important regulations and government agencies' conservative approach. The data used to estimate costs included academic estimates prior to 1988, agency estimates from 1987 to 2000, and estimates of major rules from 1999 to 2008. The methodologies varied between academic studies and agency estimates. In its 2000 report to Congress, OMB criticized the method of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations by combining individual studies due to varying quality, methodology, and potential for double counting. The authors of a study on environmental regulatory costs also inaccurately recorded information from OMB reports in two one-year periods. The authors inaccurately recorded OMB's estimates of environmental regulatory costs for two one-year periods. They did not include OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations in their study. Overall, OMB's estimated benefits were higher than costs in most time periods. In most time periods, OMB's estimated benefits of environmental regulations exceeded costs. Crain and Crain used OMB's upper estimate of environmental costs due to perceived absence of cost estimates for some regulations. They noted that government agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. Crain and Crain cited studies showing government agencies tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for relying on industry estimates, which may overstate costs and not consider technological advancements. CPR also questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain to estimate environmental regulation costs. OMB responded to comments on its report to Congress on regulations, acknowledging the theory that agency estimates may understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest. However, OMB noted that regulated entities may overstate costs to avoid regulations, and competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations using new technologies. Some commenters referenced upcoming case studies to support this argument. Some commenters referenced upcoming case studies to support the argument that agencies tend to overestimate the benefits of their programs. Crain and Crain estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, with a cost of $49.77 per hour for businesses. Crain and Crain estimated the cost of completing business paperwork at $49.77 per hour for businesses and $31.53 per hour for individuals and nonprofits in 2009. They arrived at an estimated 4.3 billion hours of tax paperwork in 2008, with a total cost of about $159.6 billion. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate, with about 7.5 billion burden hours in 2008. The Crain and Crain report estimated the cost of completing business paperwork at $49.77 per hour for businesses and $31.53 per hour for individuals and nonprofits in 2009. They calculated 4.3 billion hours of tax paperwork in 2008, costing about $159.6 billion. The IRS accounted for 77.8% of the government-wide estimate, with approximately 7.5 billion burden hours in 2008. However, certain aspects of how Crain and Crain monetized IRS burden hours are unclear, such as assumptions about who completes tax paperwork and where hourly rates were derived from. The cost of tax compliance is estimated to be about $172.5 billion, which is $12.9 billion higher than previous estimates. There is a debate on whether tax paperwork should be included in regulatory cost estimates, with OMB arguing that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself. IRS paperwork burden is mainly driven by the complexities of the Tax Code. The IRS paperwork burden is mainly driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, which requires collecting a tremendous amount of information for taxpayer compliance. Continuous revisions to the Tax Code have increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements, adding to taxpayer burden. Statutorily driven revisions, such as those from the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, have further increased the burden on taxpayers. Additionally, factors like economic and population growth have increased the aggregate IRS burden hours. The authors estimated the total cost of occupational safety and health regulations, including homeland security, in 2008 by combining data from various sources. This included workplace regulations primarily from OSHA and homeland security costs, totaling over $64.3 billion in 2009 dollars. Additionally, they included costs from 2001 to 2008 for occupational safety and health regulations ($471 million) and all homeland security costs through 2008 (about $10.4 billion). The authors estimated the total cost of occupational safety and health regulations, including homeland security, in 2008 at about $75.2 billion. They obtained the estimate for occupational safety and health regulatory costs from OMB's 2009 report to Congress, with costs associated with four rules estimated at between $362 million and $389 million. The authors may have only used the upper-end of OMB's estimated cost range for these regulations. Crain and Crain estimated the total cost of homeland security regulations in 2008 at about $75.2 billion, using the upper-end of OMB's estimated cost range. They obtained their estimate from OMB's 2009 report, which stated that homeland security regulations impose a total annual cost on the economy of between $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Converting these costs to 2009 dollars yields a range of $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion. The authors' use of the upper-end of OMB's estimates for environmental rules reflected their judgment that cost estimates were absent for important regulations. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the overestimation of regulatory costs in occupational safety and health by Crain and Crain, stating that the authors' estimates likely inflate true compliance costs. They argued that including fines for violations as regulatory costs enables opponents to argue for reducing regulations. W. Mark Crain estimated total federal regulatory costs in 2004 at about $1.11 trillion. In 2005, W. Mark Crain estimated total federal regulatory costs in 2004 at about $1.11 trillion. In 2010, the costs in 2008 were estimated at about $1.75 trillion, showing an increase of about $639 billion (57.4%) in four years. The main reason for the increase was a change in the methodology used in developing the cost estimate of economic regulations. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years. In 2001, the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandated OMB to report on federal regulatory costs and benefits in the President's budget, including an analysis of impacts on various sectors. In its 1997 report, OMB estimated total federal regulatory costs in 1997 at $279 billion, and estimated the benefits of federal regulations at $298 billion. In its 1998 report, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at between $170 billion and $230 billion (in 1996 dollars as of 1998), and estimated regulatory benefits at between $260 billion and $3.5 trillion. The dramatic increase in the benefits estimate was almost entirely due to the inclusion of an EPA estimate of the benefits associated with the Clean Air Act, which raised serious questions among observers. The OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at between $146 billion and $229 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1999, with benefits estimated at between $254 billion and nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in the upper-bound benefits estimate was mainly due to a decrease in the EPA's estimate of the Clean Air Act benefits. OMB highlighted methodological challenges in estimating total costs and benefits of federal regulations, including unclear baselines and regulatory requirements becoming standard business practices. The OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at between $146 billion and $229 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1999, with benefits estimated at between $254 billion and nearly $1.8 trillion. Regulatory requirements can become standard business practices, making it difficult to attribute costs or benefits solely to federal regulations. Technological change can greatly impact previous estimates of benefits and costs, and aggregating results from different studies is challenging due to varying methodologies. It is unclear which rules should be included in tabulations of regulatory costs and benefits, with \"transfer\" rules like crop subsidy payments excluded by OMB. The OMB excluded costs associated with tax paperwork and rules published after 1987 without cost-benefit analyses in its reports since 2001. The reports focus on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually that have been monetized. The OMB's reports from 2002 and 2003 provided estimates of costs and benefits for regulations reviewed over specific time periods. The total costs ranged from $37 billion to $53 billion, with benefits ranging from $48 billion to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a significant portion of the benefits. The reports focused on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The OMB decided not to reproduce aggregate estimates of costs and benefits for regulations issued over ten years ago due to their unreliable nature. Estimates for rules adopted prior to the 10-year period are considered of questionable relevance now. John D. Graham emphasized the inaccuracy of past attempts to estimate aggregate costs of regulations. The Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion from 2001, used for regulatory accounting, is a rough indicator of regulatory activity based on outdated data. The estimate combines diverse types of regulations and may no longer be accurate for official accounting statements. The cost estimates used in aggregate estimates of regulations combine diverse types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing transfers of income. Information by agency and program is lacking, and benefit information is nonexistent. Many studies relied upon for these estimates lack transparency, making reproducibility difficult. Recent Reports to Congress focus on costs and benefits of major regulations prepared by agencies and reviewed by OMB over the last ten years. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported estimates of the total annual benefits and costs of 98 regulations reviewed from 1998 to 2008. The estimated costs ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion, with benefits between $126 billion and $663 billion. However, these estimates were not a complete account of all regulations issued during that period. OMB reported estimates of total annual benefits and costs of 98 regulations from 1998 to 2008, noting they were not a complete account of all regulations issued during that period. OMB presented information for a 10-year period due to the questionable relevance of pre-regulation estimates beyond that timeframe. Aggregating benefit and cost estimates of individual regulations provides insight, but the resulting estimates are not precise or complete. Comparing OMB's estimates with Crain and Crain's estimates is challenging due to different construction methods and presentation categories. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were much larger than OMB's estimates. They included costs associated with all rules and major rules, while OMB only included major rules meeting specific criteria over a 10-year period. Crain and Crain also accounted for economic regulations and tax paperwork costs, unlike OMB. Decision makers should be cautious when using studies on aggregate regulatory costs and benefits, as the validity of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate depends on the reliability of its individual elements. The validity and reliability of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 is based on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States. However, concerns have been raised about misinterpretation of the index, with suggestions to compare the US index to a country with a preferable index like Ireland. This comparison could significantly reduce the estimated cost of economic regulations. Crain and Crain's estimates for regulatory costs were criticized for using outdated data and questionable methods. They defended their use of the regulatory quality index but faced concerns about its accuracy. The World Bank cautioned against relying solely on such measures for governance reforms. OMB has criticized the use of outdated data and questionable methods in estimating regulatory costs. Crain and Crain relied on high cost estimates from OMB reports, arguing that government agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. However, OMB has disputed this claim, stating that estimates over 10 years old are of questionable relevance. Additionally, OMB's annual reports to Congress since 2003 have focused on major regulations' costs and benefits. Since 2003, OMB's annual reports to Congress have focused on the costs and benefits of major regulations issued in the previous 10 years. OMB believes older estimates are unreliable for informing policy decisions, as incremental regulatory costs tend to decrease over time due to changing business practices and consumer expectations. For example, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has improved automobile safety, eliminating regulations may not lead to companies removing safety features, as consumer demand and product liability concerns drive continued safety improvements. This trend also applies to environmental regulations, albeit to a lesser extent. Environmentally responsible behavior has become good for the bottom line, leading to a \"rising baseline\" phenomenon that reduces the true costs and benefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations. Estimates of regulation costs and benefits may be overestimated, with OMB suggesting that compliance costs for regulations over ten years old may not be significantly reduced if they were to disappear overnight. Crain and Crain's estimate for tax paperwork costs may be higher than actual data suggests. The authors' assumptions on tax paperwork costs may be too high, and there is a debate on whether tax paperwork should be considered in the same category as regulatory costs. Crain and Crain's report did not discuss the benefits of federal regulations, despite readily available information from OMB reports. They stated that addressing regulatory benefits would be a logical next step towards a rational regulatory system. The authors did not include regulatory benefits in their study as required by the Office of Advocacy. Executive Order 12866 mandates agencies to assess both costs and benefits of regulations, aiming to maximize net benefits. OMB reports have shown that estimated benefits of federal regulations generally exceed costs. From October 1999 to September 2009, major rules reviewed by OMB had estimated costs between $43 billion and $55 billion, and benefits between $128 billion and $616 billion. In FY2009, costs ranged from $3.7 billion to $9.5 billion, with benefits between $8.6 billion and $28.9 billion. In the draft report for 2011, costs were estimated at $44 billion to $62 billion, and benefits at $136 billion to $651 billion for rules reviewed from October 2000 to September 2010. In FY2010, costs ranged from $6.5 billion to $12.5 billion, with benefits between $23.3 billion and $82.3 billion. Agencies often quantified or monetized either benefits or costs, but not both. Crain and Crain's estimate of federal regulations costing $1.75 trillion in 2008 has been cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation. However, they clarify that their report is not meant to be a decision-making tool for lawmakers. Information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers to consider. It is important to also consider the monetized benefits of regulations in determining the appropriate level of regulation. The cost of federal regulations in 2008 was estimated at $1.75 trillion, with debates on the accuracy of this figure. Policymakers must weigh the monetized benefits against these costs to make informed decisions. A study by CRS analyzed data from 30 OECD countries to assess the sensitivity of these results, using similar variables like regulatory quality index, broadband penetration rates, population, and foreign trade. The study by Crain and Crain analyzed the impact of various variables on GDP per capita, including regulatory quality index, broadband penetration rates, country population, and foreign trade. They found a negative correlation between primary school enrollment and GDP per capita, which they attributed to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects. To account for this, CRS added demographic variables such as the proportion of the population under 14 and over 65 in their analysis. The study by Crain and Crain analyzed the impact of various variables on GDP per capita, including regulatory quality index, broadband penetration rates, country population, and foreign trade. Estimation results using Stata 11 xtreg procedure with year indicator variables showed insignificant coefficients on regulatory quality index and population. Other coefficients had expected signs and were statistically significant. The estimated coefficient on the regulatory quality index was very small and not significantly different from zero. The study analyzed the impact of variables on GDP per capita, including regulatory quality index. Estimation results showed insignificant coefficients on regulatory quality index. One test statistic indicates that most variance results from differences among countries. Panel estimation methods may be challenging for variables that change slowly over time. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific regulatory changes may provide better understanding of regulation effects on economic activity."
