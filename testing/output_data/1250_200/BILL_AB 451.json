    "title": "AB 451",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code in California allows cities and counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use. These facilities are subject to certain traffic laws, with the option for operators to regulate unauthorized parking. If a city or county allows public use of privately owned offstreet parking facilities, the owner must provide instructions on contesting parking fees and cannot use the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution must be enacted with a public hearing and prior notice for privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Enforcement of Section 22507.8 can occur without the need for an ordinance or posting notices at entrances. The department is not required to patrol or enforce provisions of the code on privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Cities or counties must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinances, including written policies, administrative hearings, and decisions delivered by mail. The examiner may allow payment of parking charges in installments for those unable to pay in full. Incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed invoices are prohibited. A cap on parking invoice fees is set to match municipal fines. Private parking regulators are prohibited from posing as government agencies and must clearly state on invoices that they are not issued by the local government."
