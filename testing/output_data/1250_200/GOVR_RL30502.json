P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) partially funded select accounts from the primary funding measure. Various measures were considered before the enactment of P.L. 106-554 for FY2001 appropriations. The key details of the curr_chunk include various legislative bills and appropriations such as H.R. 4871, S. 2900, H.R. 4516, H.R. 4985, P.L. 106-346, P.L. 106-275, P.L. 106-426, P.L. 106-520, and P.L. 106-554.

The President submits the Budget annually to Congress through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Congress passes a concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget and allocates discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. Treasury appropriations fund law enforcement organizations like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and Internal Revenue Service. Treasury appropriations cover various agencies including the Secret Service, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Funding also supports the U.S. Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission and National Archives. The Treasury and General Government appropriation funds independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission, General Services Administration, National Archives, Office of Personnel Management, Office of Special Counsel, and the United States Tax Court. The appropriation includes general titles with governmentwide restrictions and authorities for defined actions, such as prohibiting the use of funds for non-U.S. citizens' employment and authorizing travel expenses for immediate family members of federal employees serving overseas in case of death or life-threatening illness. New provisions in titles V and VI are also presented. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affecting all accounts in the Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget is required to report on the implementation of the rescission when the FY2002 budget is submitted. The rescission applies to all net positive discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, including advance appropriations for FY 2001 provided in FY 2000 or earlier years. Discretionary emergency appropriations are also subject to the rescission, with a requirement for the reduction to be applied equally to each program, project, and activity. The Act mandates a 0.22% reduction in discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, affecting all accounts. Agencies must allocate the reduction equally to each program, project, and activity without exception. The rescission cannot be applied to mandatory funds or transfers. Agencies will receive their specific rescission amounts from OMB and must make reductions only from discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.38% across-the-board rescission from discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. OMB reported specific reductions in accounts, allowing departments to protect high-priority programs as long as the 0.38% reduction was achieved. Certain programs were exempt, but the rescission was to be universally applied.

ATF needed increased funding to monitor new permit and revenue requirements for tobacco importers. Regulation and enforcement of firearms laws by ATF have been controversial. Legislation aimed to prevent preferences in firearm acquisition for manufacturers or vendors with agreements exceeding federal requirements.

The total cost of ACE development, operation, and maintenance over 7 years is estimated to be between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. The development, operation, and maintenance of ACE over 7 years will cost between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs will begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. GAO testified that Customs had implemented recommendations to reduce duplication of effort and improve acquisition and investment management for ACE, a complex and high-risk endeavor supporting revenue collection from imports. Customs generates offsetting receipts from user fee programs established by various acts. Customs relies on COBRA fee receipts to fund permanent inspector positions and information technology costs, with an increase in funding from $176 million to $299 million from FY1992 to FY2000.

The Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990 governs pay for federal white-collar employees. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990, federal white collar employees receive annual adjustments to base pay based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index. The base pay adjustment for January 2001 is 2.7%, with no proposed changes. Locality-based payments are calculated based on surveys of specific localities within the United States. The surveys show that locality-based payments would need to average about 16% to meet FEPCA expectations. President Clinton proposed an alternative plan with locality payments equal to 1% of payroll. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited wage adjustments in high-cost areas to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule salaries. Lower cost areas will see wage increases based on wage surveys. The FY2001 appropriations limit wage increases for high-cost areas, while lower cost areas can increase based on wage surveys. Pay adjustments for federal officials are based on ECI calculations, capped at the General Schedule rate.

Beginning in May 2001, employees covered by FERS can contribute up to 11% of pay to the TSP, while those under CSRS can contribute up to 6%. These limits will increase by 1% each year until reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal 2006, percentage-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be eliminated, and employees will be subject to contribution limits under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g).
