    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with foreign firms for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss and unemployment. The impact of offshore outsourcing on the labor market remains uncertain, with some attributing it to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession. Some observers believe offshoring contributed to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession, while others argue that the labor market eventually recovered. Offshoring may have accounted for 3% of job loss in the early 2000s and is seen as a factor in the slow rebound from the 2007-2009 recession. Economists suggest that while globalization can cause disruptions, it benefits the nation by offering a variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets for U.S. firms. The offshoring of service activities may benefit companies by lowering costs, but critics argue that the profits are used for dividends and mergers instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The shift of service jobs overseas raises concerns about the impact on the labor market and public policy, especially regarding the skill level of the jobs being moved. The offshoring of service activities raises concerns about the skill level of jobs being moved abroad and the impact on U.S. job growth. Policymakers are considering measures to encourage domestic employment and address the needs of well-educated workers affected by offshoring. U.S. firms are urged to increase domestic employment rather than outsourcing overseas. Some advocate for trade and labor policies to support U.S. companies, while others prefer limited government intervention for economic growth. The report examines the history of outsourcing by U.S. companies and its impact on U.S. employment, aiming to help policymakers assess retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. Overseas relocation of manufacturing work predates the recent wave of services offshoring. The outsourcing of manufacturing work by major U.S. companies began in the 1970s and 1980s in response to competition from Japanese and European corporations. This led to the relocation of production facilities abroad, impacting well-paid U.S. factory workers. Companies also outsourced non-core activities to specialized domestic enterprises for efficiency. The trend of domestic outsourcing has become a permanent reorganization of work in the United States, with further efficiencies sought through technological innovations during the 2001 recession. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve further efficiencies by utilizing technological innovations that minimize physical distance between companies, enabling offshoring of jobs beyond goods production to services. This shift impacted both information technology (IT) workers and IT-enabled workers, with other countries enhancing their ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States and other developed countries. The Y2K crisis led U.S. firms to outsource code fixes to India due to a shortage of programmers. Low-wage foreign nations also produced a surplus of skilled workers in IT and accounting. This allowed U.S. companies to distribute tasks globally, not just in manufacturing but also in information and business services. Companies are increasingly fragmenting tasks across borders in manufacturing and information services. This includes locating intangible production tasks like research, design, and IT support in different countries. Offshoring has contributed to increased wage inequality in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also impacted wage polarization. Data on job losses due to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking layoffs involving the relocation of jobs out of the country since 2004. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks layoffs involving the relocation of jobs out of the country since 2004. In the third quarter of 2012, over 100,000 workers were separated in extended mass layoffs, with less than 1% having their jobs moved abroad. Forrester Research forecasts 3.4 million service-sector jobs may move abroad between 2003 and 2015. Forrester Research projected that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015. This forecast was based on discussions with experts, indicating a trend of employers transferring service activities overseas. Bhagwati et al. noted that this loss of jobs, averaging 300,000 per year, was relatively small compared to the overall job turnover in the United States. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring, with Bardhan and Kroll estimating that around 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations could potentially be sent overseas. In 2001, over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, accounting for 11% of U.S. employment, were identified as potentially being sent overseas due to factors like no in-person customer interaction, routinized tasks, and pay gaps. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers, mainly in industries like information, finance, and professional services. Brookings Institution projected job losses in 246 metropolitan areas due to offshoring from 2004-2015. The analysis projected that offshoring may not greatly affect most metropolitan areas, with only 2.2% of jobs likely to be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, might lose slightly more jobs by 2015. Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring tend to be populous and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. About 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was found to be in offshorable industries. Manufacturing and professional services industries were estimated to have above-average vulnerability to offshoring. They also examined the task content of service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring based on factors like face-to-face contact, telecommutability, and routine vs. complex activities. The job requires face-to-face contact with others, is telecommutable or involves an IT-enabled work process, and includes routine or complex activities. Jensen and Kletzer identified occupational groups such as computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and office/administrative support as having a large share of employment in offshorable categories. BLS estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on professional and technical categories. Service occupations with a higher percentage of bachelor's degree holders were ranked as more vulnerable to offshoring. In 2007, there were 30 million jobs in offshorable service-providing occupations, accounting for over one-fifth of total employment. Despite vulnerability to offshoring, these occupations saw slightly faster employment and wage growth between 2001-2007. The most susceptible occupations experienced below-average growth, with varying skills and education levels. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations (533) and employed persons (92.6 million in 2004) are non offshorable, while a minority of U.S. occupations (about 200) and workers (almost 30 million) fall in the highly offshorable and offshorable categories. He considered the estimate of potentially offshorable jobs too conservative and added more occupations to create a moderate estimate totaling 25.6% of all U.S. workers. Blinder's estimates range from 25.6% to 29.0% of all U.S. jobs being susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on occupations not necessarily low-end. Different research studies on offshoring of services show varying results, possibly due to different measures of offshorability used by analysts. One in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, according to Blinder and Krueger's analysis. Offshorability is prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services industries. Some experts believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, but caution that executives need to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to boost productivity. Deloitte Consulting predicts that outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will carefully define core functions before moving potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad. In the future, companies will not outsource as it is no longer seen as a \"holy grail.\" Organizations will define core functions and retain them in-house for knowledge and control. Some will outsource short-term, while others will re-insource operations. Dell and other firms have brought back services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Manufacturing companies are also reshoring production from overseas, contributing to employment rebound. Perry found that about one-fifth of companies have brought production back from overseas due to China's shrinking manufacturing advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Despite concerns like security post-9/11 and increased outsourcing of maintenance jobs by U.S. airline carriers, some companies are still reshoring production to the United States. Global providers of software services have responded to unrest in regions like India and Pakistan by diversifying their client work to countries like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to cultural similarities, while others continue to outsource to low-wage countries like Vietnam. Data on U.S. job losses to offshore outsourcing is limited, with a focus on identifying jobs susceptible to movement overseas. Empirical analyses focus on identifying jobs at risk of being moved overseas, potentially overstating job losses to offshoring by not considering all factors influencing employers' location decisions."
