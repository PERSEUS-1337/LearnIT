    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and 30% of the tenant's income. The program is federally funded but administered locally by public housing authorities. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the voucher renewal funding distribution, causing uncertainty for many local PHAs. This has prompted calls for permanent funding reform, possibly through Section 8 voucher legislation. The changes in funding formula started in FY2003, with PHAs previously funded based on per-voucher costs from the previous year. Despite receiving full funding, low utilization rates were a concern for Congress. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates. PHAs typically had more money in their budgets than needed due to underutilization, allowing HUD to recapture excess funds at the end of the year. HUD used a formula based on actual costs and inflation to request funding from Congress for Section 8 vouchers, with unused funds being available for rescission. This system resulted in increased funding for PHAs as costs rose. The funding system for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) allowed them to recapture unused funds, leading to increased funding as costs rose. Congress provided more funds for voucher renewals than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding method to limit recaptures and better reflect actual voucher use by funding PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year. The law required the renewal of section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) based on their actual utilization rates and costs reported in their financial statements. HUD implemented this provision to ensure PHAs' budgets were aligned with their leasing activity and expenses. HUD implemented renewal calculations for PHAs based on actual utilization rates and costs reported in financial statements. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months, using recent leasing and cost data for accuracy. Congress created a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves if needed for increased costs or utilization. The bill imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, limiting the number of vouchers a PHA could support. PHAs had to adjust leasing levels to stay within authorized limits. FY2004 appropriations continued funding based on actual voucher utilization to control costs. The conference report expressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program. The conferees were concerned about cost increases in the voucher program and expected the Secretary to control costs by renewing expiring annual contributions contracts based on unit months under lease and applying an inflation factor. (H.Rept. 108-235, Title II; P.L. 108-199, Title II, Section (1)) The FY2004 language differed from FY2003 in how Central Reserve funds could be used, with funds only allowed for replenishing reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD implemented this through a notice on April 22, 2004 (PIH 2004-7), basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). The notice on April 22, 2004, based PHAs' budgets on end-of-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). Some housing advocates disagreed with the use of only the AAF for adjustments, arguing for a broader measure of inflation. HUD granted appeals requests from 380 agencies out of 400, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding based on voucher costs and utilization rates as of May-July 2004 plus the AAF. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004 plus the HUD-published AAF. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial statement. If the allocated amount was insufficient, budgets were prorated. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. The act also continued the prohibition on maximized leasing. The FY2005 appropriations act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided guidance on budget levels in December 2004, with appeals limited to data errors. Final calculations were published in January 2005, resulting in agencies being funded at 4.03% less than their actual costs from May-July 2004. The final calculations for PHA renewal budgets in FY2005 were published on January 21, 2005, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than their actual costs from May-July 2004. The funding amount provided by Congress was not sufficient to fund agencies at 100% of their formula eligibility, resulting in a proration factor of just under 96%. HUD also provided administrative options for PHAs to lower costs in 2005, such as lowering payment standards and reviewing rents for reasonableness in the market. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) included measures such as reviewing rents for market reasonableness, suspending voucher reissuance, restricting bedroom sizes, instituting minimum rents, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. Funding was distributed based on CY2005 eligibility adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. PHAs could request budget adjustments due to low leasing or unforeseen costs. HUD retained the prohibition on maximized leasing in FY2006. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act included measures to control costs for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Funding was insufficient, leading to PHAs being funded at 94% of their eligibility. Changes in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, resulting in flat average annual per voucher costs from 2004 to 2005 and a 1.5% decline from 2005 to 2006. Utilization dropped, with nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs accumulated reserve funds as they were not spending all their funding. In 2006, there was a drop in budget utilization for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), with nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds as they were not spending all their funding. The debate in FY2007 was between a \"budget-based\" and a \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to continue funding the voucher program using a budget-based formula. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal for a budget-based funding formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Instead, they adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The law also included a central reserve fund for adjustments in renewal costs. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's budget-based funding formula for PHAs. They adopted a formula based on leasing and cost data, with a central reserve fund for adjustments in renewal costs. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs affected by Hurricane Katrina and those at risk of losing funding. In FY2007, PHAs were funded based on their FY2006 usage rather than FY2006 funding received. The formula favored PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates, while those with lower costs did worse. Funding was sufficient for all PHAs at over 105% of eligibility, allowing them to serve the same or more families. The FY2007 formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements, with funding allocations tied to voucher usage and capped quantities. The FY2008 funding formula for PHAs was unit-based and budget-based, with funding allocations tied to voucher usage and capped quantities. President Bush's FY2008 budget request included a proposal for a strictly \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula similar to FY2007. The FY2008 Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for PHAs, similar to FY2007. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments and an alternative formula for specific agencies. Unlike FY2007, it also included a rescission that reduced funding levels based on unusable reserves exceeding 7% of total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs, freeing up unusable reserves above 7% of their funding. This allowed Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing overall funding available to PHAs. In FY2009, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on leased vouchers and costs from FY2008, adjusted for inflation. In FY2009, PHAs were allocated funding based on leased vouchers and costs from FY2008, adjusted for inflation. The allocation was prorated based on HUD's estimate of Net Restricted Assets (NRA), with a $750 million rescinded offset. PHAs were expected to supplement their funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside for certain circumstances. HUD's estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances were not always accurate. In FY2009, PHAs faced funding shortfalls due to inaccurate estimates by HUD. Approximately 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program did not have enough funding to cover all vouchers. HUD provided additional funding from the $100 million renewal set-aside and advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to address the shortfall. If a PHA lacks sufficient funding to renew all vouchers, they may have to stop issuing vouchers, leading to families losing assistance. In response to funding shortfalls in FY2009, HUD provided additional funding to PHAs facing budget issues to prevent families from losing assistance. Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million to support PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, based on PHAs' costs and utilization, with the main difference being an increased set-aside renewal funding to prevent assistance termination. The FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, based on PHAs' costs and utilization. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a similar formula but did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization in FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2012 law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. PHAs experienced changes in serving families and spending federal funding following formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006. Utilization patterns have begun to change again with funding utilization increasing from around 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. Utilization patterns of PHAs have changed, with funding utilization increasing to 95% by the end of 2009. PHAs served over 150,000 more families by 2009 compared to 2006. Reserves accumulated in 2005 and 2006 were spent down due to rescissions in 2008 and 2009. Per voucher costs began rising in 2007 and were expected to continue increasing in 2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation to change the funding formula. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes starting in FY2003 to control costs and shift to a fixed sum allocation model. Appropriations Committees have overridden new funding formulas each year since FY2003, raising uncertainty on deference to authorizing committees. Prior to FY2003, funding was determined by a formula, resembling an entitlement program. The Section 8 voucher program's funding structure was changed to a fixed sum allocation model, giving Congress more control over the budget. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) found the changes difficult to administer as they had limited control over costs. Some PHAs made adjustments like lowering payment standards and selecting higher-income families to reduce subsidy costs. This led to landlords accepting reduced rents or opting out of the program. Many PHAs intentionally reduced voucher utilization rates to save money in FY2004, leading to budget constraints in FY2005. Voucher costs stabilized and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006, with average costs decreasing by 1.5% and utilization dropping by over 2%. Some agencies received more funding than allowed under the budget-based formulas in FY2005 and FY2006. In FY2005 and FY2006, some PHAs received more funding than allowed under budget-based formulas, leading to unused funds. Advocates called for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula, citing difficulties with the current system. The FY2007 funding bill reverted to a voucher renewal formula similar to previous years. In FY2007, PHAs were funded based on their previous year's usage rather than received amount. Funding was sufficient for all PHAs to serve families adequately. FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed FY2007, with reductions for agencies with excess reserves. FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar, without reserve reductions. FY2012 saw agency reserves used to offset renewal costs. The budget-based funding model has been replaced. The funding model for PHAs changed from budget-based to cost and utilization-based in FY2012, leading to increased costs and utilization. Rising costs may pressure policy makers to contain costs, which could impact the number of families served and result in unspent funds. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds accumulation. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation focuses on maximizing families served without firmly capping cost growth. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation aims to maximize families served without firmly capping future cost growth, which could be overridden by future appropriations legislation."
