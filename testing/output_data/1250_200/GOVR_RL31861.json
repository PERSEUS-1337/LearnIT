    "content": "Since 9/11, policymakers have been working to reduce the US vulnerability to terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction. This report discusses high-threat chemical agents, their availability, detection, and policy approaches to mitigate the threat. While the probability of terrorist use of chemical agents is low, the consequences could be severe. There is debate on whether terrorist groups are interested in acquiring and using chemical agents, but the US remains vulnerable to chemical attacks. Policy approaches have focused on reducing chemical vulnerability as a whole, rather than specific agents. Detection capabilities for military and civilian use vary, as do treatments for chemical exposure, which must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Chemical exposure treatments vary depending on the type of chemical and must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Limited practical experience in treating chemical casualties exists, especially among civilian healthcare providers. High-threat chemical agents pose exceptional lethality and danger to humans, with different symptoms and injuries caused by different chemical weapons. Identifying the specific chemical or type is crucial for determining the most effective treatment for victims. Chemical weapons may produce effects through different exposure routes. Chemical weapons can have different effects depending on the exposure route and type of chemical. Military planners categorize these agents into nerve, blister, choking, and blood agents based on the effects they cause. Nerve agents, like organophosphates, are manmade compounds with high toxicity and purity, primarily used as weapons. Nerve agents, such as Tabun, Sarin, and VX, were developed for military use in the 1930s and later by various countries like Germany, England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. These highly toxic liquids were used sparingly in conflicts, with reports of Iraq using them in the Iran-Iraq war and against Kurdish populations. Iraq used nerve agents against Iranian troops and Kurdish population. Nerve agents are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or skin contact. VX is the most difficult to manufacture and the most deadly, causing overstimulation of muscles and potential death. Nerve agents can cause overstimulation of muscles, leading to symptoms like nausea, weakness, convulsions, and spasms. High concentrations can result in loss of muscle control, nervous system irregularities, and even death. Atropine and pralidoxime chloride are antidotes used to treat nerve agent exposure, with atropine preventing muscle spasms and pralidoxime chloride reversing the agent's effects. Treatment effectiveness depends on the specific nerve agent, with some requiring immediate intervention to prevent irreversible damage. Diazepam (Valium) may also be used to reduce convulsions and seizures from nerve agent exposure. Blister agents, such as mustard agents, cause painful blistering of the skin and require full body protection. Mustard agents were first developed in the late 1800s and evaporate quickly, with vapors also being injurious. These chemicals reduce combat effectiveness by necessitating bulky protective gear. Blister agents, like mustard agents, were first developed in the late 1800s and have been used in conflicts such as World War I and the Iran-Iraq war. Many countries have stockpiled blister agents in their chemical weapon inventories. The production of blister agents is considered less complicated than nerve agents, requiring toxic chemicals and specialized equipment. Blister agents can enter the body through the lungs or skin, causing burns even through clothing. The United States is currently destroying its stockpile of blister agents. Blister agents can penetrate through clothing, causing burns on skin. Symptoms may be delayed, with initial signs of reddening, pain, swelling, blisters, and lesions. Exposure to large amounts can be fatal. Eyes are sensitive to blister agents, with potential for corneal damage and scarring. Inhaling blister agents can cause damage to the lungs. Blister agents can cause burns on skin and damage to the lungs. Exposure to high concentrations may lead to permanent lung damage. Treatment involves symptomatically treating skin lesions and respiratory tract injuries, with possible hospitalization and mechanical ventilation for severe cases. Mustard agents can weaken the immune system, requiring precautions against opportunistic infections. Choking agents like chlorine, ammonia, and phosgene can cause breathing difficulties and permanent lung damage. Choking agents, such as chlorine, ammonia, and phosgene, are gases with strong odors and can cause breathing difficulties and permanent lung damage. They have been used in wartime and industrial accidents. Choking agents are dual-use chemicals with civilian and military applications, requiring specialized equipment for production. They were extensively used during World War I, with chlorine gas being the first major chemical attack. Exposure to choking agents primarily affects the respiratory system, causing chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Effects of choking agents include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, irritation of nose and throat, tearing eyes, lung swelling, respiratory failure, and potential death. Symptoms of lung damage may appear up to 48 hours after exposure. Treatment involves rest, oxygen supplementation, and corticosteroids for fluid accumulation in the lungs. Blood agents, such as hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts, interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level. Hydrogen cyanide, a volatile gas with an almond smell, was used in chemical warfare and as the active agent in Zyklon B, the gas used in German concentration camps during World War II. It is now used in industrial applications in the chemical, electroplating, and mining industries. Blood agents, like hydrogen cyanide, are used in industrial applications and interfere with cellular oxygen use. They can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. Treatment involves specific antidotes to remove cyanide from the body. Blood agents, such as hydrogen cyanide, can cause symptoms like headache, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. Treatment involves specific antidotes to remove cyanide from the body, such as amyl or sodium nitrite combined with sodium thiosulfate. Physical protection against chemical agents includes gas masks and special clothing. Gas mask filters with activated charcoal are effective against inhaled chemical agents but may not fully protect against skin contact with certain agents. Gas mask filters are made of activated charcoal to remove particles and chemicals from the airstream. The filters have a limited lifetime based on the amount of activated charcoal remaining. Protective garments, such as hazardous materials suits, are made of rubber with activated charcoal for skin contact protection. Military battle dress overgarments are cloth with charcoal-impregnated foam for battlefield protection. The combination of mask and suit provides full protection against most chemical exposures. There are limited examples of medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons. Pyridostigmine bromide provides some protection against the nerve agent Soman by preventing permanent binding of nerve agents within the nervous system. It is recommended for use only in high imminent threat situations due to noticeable side effects. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense has developed a chemical-resistant skin cream called SERPACWA to complement protective equipment for soldiers in the field. Decontamination is crucial for removing chemicals from victims to prevent secondary exposure and protect those treating the victims. It is especially important for victims exposed to liquid chemical agents. Treatment follows decontamination, with specific antidotes or symptomatic treatment. Chemical weapons detection is a concern for military planners and commercial manufacturing plants. The manufacture of chemical agents for commercial use requires detection capabilities at manufacturing plants and by hazardous-materials first responders. Military units have equipment for chemical weapon detection, while civilian first responders use commercial equipment. Developing a portable, integrated instrument for quickly detecting all chemical agents is an ongoing area of research. The Department of Defense uses various technologies for detecting and identifying chemical agents, including personal sensors and field-adapted laboratory methods. Detection of chemical agents serves purposes such as providing warning of an attack, identifying the chemical agent used, and determining when an area is clear of chemical agents after an attack. Detection techniques for chemical agents post-terror attack include detection paper, tickets, and tubes that change color when exposed to agents. However, false positives can occur due to other substances dissolving the pigments. Handheld detectors like the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) can detect mustard and nerve agents at low levels. Different papers, tickets, or tubes may be needed to identify the specific agent encountered. Handheld detectors like the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) and Automatic Chemical Agent Detector/Alarm (ACADA) can detect chemical agents below lethal levels. Commercially available equipment is used by hazardous material response teams to assess potential terrorist activity. The President has requested funding for research on standards for first responder detection equipment. The National Institute of Justice provides guidelines to aid first responders in choosing the best detection system. The National Institute of Justice provides guidelines for first responders to choose the best detection system. The Metropolitan Medical Response System enhances local capabilities in the event of a terrorist incident. Public health systems can also help detect chemical terrorism events by alerting health care professionals. Increases in public health networking since September 11, 2001 have improved information sharing between localities. Chemical agents may be used as weapons of terror in enclosed spaces, causing fear beyond casualties. Aum Shinrikyo used Sarin in the Tokyo subway in 1995, killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. The Laboratory Response Network links diagnostic labs for chemical agent identification. Experts believe it's challenging for terrorists to use chemical weapons as mass destruction tools. VX nerve agent would require large amounts to be lethal over a wide area. In 1995, Aum Shinrikyo used Sarin in the Tokyo subway, killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. The cult also carried out an attack in Matsumoto, killing 7 and injuring over 200. Both attacks used G-series nerve agents, which are more toxic through inhalation. Blister agents, like mustard agent, could cause mass terror and injury, penetrating fabrics and causing grievous harm. Choking agents are no longer effective due to protective gear. The low lethality of choking agents complicates their use as a weapon of mass destruction, but the industrial availability of some choking agents provides opportunities for acquisition. Blood agents are also difficult to employ for mass casualties due to quick dispersal and large amounts needed. Terrorist groups are increasingly interested in blood agents. Terrorist groups are showing interest in blood agents like sodium cyanide and potassium ferrocyanide for potential criminal use. Incidents involving these chemicals have been reported, including attempted attacks in Tokyo and arrests of individuals planning to poison water supplies. Terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, have shown interest in using chemical weapons like hydrogen cyanide. Training camps in Afghanistan have provided instruction on producing and using hydrogen cyanide, as seen in videos retrieved from Afghanistan showing testing on dogs. Osama bin Laden has claimed that al Qaeda possesses chemical capabilities. The testing of unknown chemical agents on dogs, possibly hydrogen cyanide, has raised concerns about chemical weapon proliferation. Multinational agreements like the Chemical Weapons Convention and export control regulations aim to prevent the spread of chemical weapons by restricting precursor chemicals and implementing inspection mechanisms. US export controls, such as Export Administration Regulations, also play a role in creating barriers to proliferation. The Department of Treasury's \"Operation Shield America\" program aims to prevent illegal acquisition and export of dual-use technologies by providing information to U.S. firms and requesting notification of suspicious activities. Industries like chemical and pharmaceutical are implementing best practices to enhance security and limit misuse of dual-use equipment. The American Chemistry Council requires its members to adhere to its Responsible Care Security Code, which includes prioritizing facilities, assessing security procedures, and conducting audits. Federal agencies are involved in research on chemical weapons countermeasures, including biomedical research and improving detector sensitivity. The extent of security preparedness at chemical facilities is unknown, and voluntary efforts only reach a fraction of facilities. The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate will fund research and development activities against chemical terrorism, with a budget request of $65 million for Chemical/High Explosives Countermeasures and $25 million for a Standards Program. The United States government continues defensive research into chemical weapons, focusing on enhancing medical treatments for victims and increasing understanding of chemical weapon action. The U.S. government funds research and development activities against chemical terrorism, focusing on enhancing medical treatments for victims and increasing understanding of chemical weapon action. Various programs are working on developing new or improved detectors for chemical weapons, including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Environmental Protection Agency. The Department of Defense is developing the next generation of chemical agent detectors, while the Department of Energy has developed the ChemLab system, a portable device for analysis. Computer programs are used to model chemical releases for better understanding. The U.S. government funds research and development activities against chemical terrorism, focusing on enhancing medical treatments for victims and increasing understanding of chemical weapon action. Various programs are working on developing new or improved detectors for chemical weapons. One response team is the DOD's Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF), which can be deployed domestically or internationally at short notice for consequence management after a chemical or biological terror attack. The U.S. government has response units like the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hazardous Materials Response Unit, the U.S. Army Technical Escort Unit, and National Disaster Medical System teams available for chemical terrorism incidents. These units provide analysis, detection, decontamination, and medical assistance in case of chemical threats or attacks. The National Guard supports Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams that can deploy within four hours to assist in determining the nature of an attack. Policymakers need to address the availability of high-threat chemical agents, detectors, first responder capabilities, treatments, and funding for addressing chemical terrorism. Some chemicals are easily available for purchase from suppliers due to their civilian use. Some chemicals, including dual-use agents, are easily available for purchase from suppliers with little oversight. Regulatory mechanisms to increase barriers to illicit acquisition, such as mandatory verification for domestic purchases, may reduce the threat. However, this proposal could burden manufacturers, distributors, and end-users with increased costs. Additionally, increasing acquisition barriers may not address the threat of theft or intentional damage during transport. Advocates suggest regulating the transport and storage of these chemicals more strictly to mitigate potential terror attacks. Some have advocated for stricter regulations on the transport and storage of chemicals to prevent terror attacks. Suggestions include limiting transport to less populated areas, reducing on-site stockpiles, and increasing security measures. Questions arise regarding acceptable thresholds for stored or transported chemical agents, with concerns about economic costs and practicality of security improvements. Legislation has been introduced to address these issues. The availability of chemical weapons in the United States is limited due to high security measures in military facilities. Some chemical weapon precursors can be purchased domestically, but companies have implemented stricter verification processes. Manufacturing chemical weapons from unregulated compounds is possible but would increase complexity and production time. Legislation in the 108th Congress aims to address these issues and suggests increasing research on reliable chemical agent detectors. Policymakers may need to focus on enhancing research for reliable chemical agent detectors to address challenges in detecting chemical weapons at low levels. Current detectors are not always effective, leading to difficulties for hazardous materials first responders. The trade-off in developing sensitive detectors includes the risk of false positives or false negatives, which can impact civilian safety. The use of chemical weapon detectors in civilian society is still uncertain, with detectors typically employed on a case-by-case basis during emergencies to assess hazardous releases and contamination levels. Chemical weapon detectors are used in response to emergencies to assess hazardous releases and contamination levels. A real-time detection system has been installed in public transit in Washington, DC, to detect potential chemical attacks. The effectiveness and cost of expanding such systems are still being assessed. The Environmental Protection Agency has a system of air quality detectors to monitor compounds like ozone. A prototype system for detecting biological agents has been added to some detectors to identify covert biological weapon release. Developing a similar system for covert chemical weapon release may be of interest. The prototype biological detection system takes samples back to a lab for testing, which is effective due to the multi-day incubation period for infection. Chemical weapons have immediate effects, so any detector system for ambient air would need to respond immediately. Chemical weapons cause immediate effects, requiring a detect-to-warn system for ambient air. Detecting small releases in enclosed spaces may be challenging and costly. Standardizing first responder equipment is a topic of interest. Some first responder teams feel prepared for potential chemical attacks, while others lack necessary equipment. The National Institute of Justice has provided criteria for assessing chemical equipment, but some responders feel the federal government lacks oversight. Advocates argue for community choice in equipment selection based on varying needs. The Department of Homeland Security's Standards Program aims to provide guidance on first responder detection equipment. Discussions also focus on the adequacy of current equipment, federal guidance to local authorities, and potential legislative steps for proper equipment provision. The lack of standardized testing methods for environmental samples in state public health laboratories is a concern. The Chemical Terrorism Project has recommendations to improve their ability to respond to chemical terrorism. Questions arise about federal agencies providing validated testing methods, support for testing equipment, and the role of the federal government in supporting state laboratories. The federal government's role in supporting state laboratories for testing equipment and research on chemical weapons treatments is debated. Some argue for federal sponsorship to accelerate progress, while others believe in improving the general public health system instead of focusing on low probability events. The possible use of federal response teams to augment local first responder capabilities has sparked differing responses. An investigation found that these teams do not duplicate each other, but concerns have been raised about redundancy and delays in response due to travel time. Some suggest the need for parallel civilian and military response teams, especially during wartime. The summarized text chunk includes various CRS reports on topics such as Biological and Toxin Weapons, First Responder Initiative, Food Safety Issues, Emergency Management Funding, Chemical Plant Security, Export Administration Act, Chemical Weapons Convention, and Proliferation Control Regimes."
