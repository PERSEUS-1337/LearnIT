    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since 9/11, with new technologies like advanced X-ray systems and whole-body scanners, along with policy changes such as requiring laptop removal. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) oversees these changes as mandated by the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). Congress also directed TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize technologies to expedite screening for certain passengers. The TSA has primarily relied on a uniform risk approach to airport checkpoint screening, despite challenges in implementing risk-based strategies. While technologies like whole-body imagers have improved threat detection, budget constraints and technology limitations have hindered a solely technology-driven approach. The TSA faces constraints in implementing a solely technology-driven approach to airport screening, due to budgetary considerations, limited resources, and space constraints at airports. This has led to cumbersome procedures for passengers, unpredictable wait times, and criticism from experts and the public. The TSA has shifted to a risk-based screening approach in response to criticisms about the current security system. This approach has sparked controversy due to differing views on risk assessment and mitigation. The focus on where to direct security efforts can be informed by the advice to prioritize the main point and parry the worst blows, as holding everything may result in holding nothing. In a free and open society, perfect security is unattainable. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized the need to prioritize security efforts to minimize risk. Risk in aviation security involves threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, with limited ability to assign specific probability values. Risk-based practices use categorical techniques and scoring methods to quantify threats and vulnerabilities. A comprehensive risk-based aviation security strategy focuses on quantifying threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks using categorical techniques and scoring methods. Risk-based passenger screening aims to detect and manage threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and utilizing detection technologies. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple security layers, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences are assessed in terms of severity and mitigated through emergency management and response. The TSA focuses on emergency management and response for mitigating consequences of security risks in aviation. Risk scoring is used for air cargo security, but not for individual passengers. Passenger risk assessment is primarily categorical, based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The TSA uses risk-based techniques to assess security threats for individual passengers, including biographical data and behavioral indicators. There is debate over the validity of behavioral-based risk scores and disagreement on specific risks to mitigate, as seen in the example of allowing small knives onboard aircraft in 2013. Critics argue that other security measures may not sufficiently mitigate the risk posed by such items. Critics, including flight attendants and pilots, opposed TSA's proposal to allow small knives, golf clubs, and baseball bats on planes, citing risks from unruly passengers. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban, and TSA ultimately decided not to proceed. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raised concerns about the focus on prohibited items lists and detection technology, arguing it hinders the security system's ability to adapt to evolving threats. Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security, pointing out that these measures may not effectively prevent terrorist attacks. He suggests integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, advocating for a more proactive and flexible approach to security. The agency should adopt a more proactive and flexible approach to security, similar to Israel's risk-based security measures. Despite threats, Israel has avoided major terrorist attacks for over 40 years using demographic profiling and extensive security interviews. Implementing an Israeli-style approach in the US is challenging legally and practically. Research suggests a tailored risk-based approach to passenger screening in the US would be more effective and politically feasible. A risk-based approach to aviation security in the United States, similar to Israel's model, is deemed more effective, feasible, and legally defensible. This approach involves multi-layered screening methods to focus resources on high-risk passengers and adapt security measures based on perceived threats. It also aids in identifying passengers for closer observation and flights that may pose higher risks. Risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been used since the early 1970s, with the FAA utilizing rudimentary passenger profiles before implementing 100% screening in 1973. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The FAA implemented rudimentary passenger profiles in the early 1970s and required airlines to ask basic security questions in the late 1980s to address concerns over aircraft bombings. These questions were criticized for their obvious intent and lack of security training among airline ticket agents. Despite their purpose to target elevated-risk checked baggage, they were eliminated by the TSA in 2006. Following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed to identify potential threats based on flight reservation data. The CAPPS system, implemented in the late 1990s, uses flight reservation data to identify potential security threats. Indicators may include purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. After 9/11, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for certain passengers. TSA was also directed to ensure CAPPS effectiveness. The CAPPS system, implemented in the late 1990s, identifies security threats using flight reservation data. After 9/11, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for certain passengers. The subsequent Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed TSA to ensure all passengers are evaluated before boarding. TSA initiated work on CAPPS II, a system for identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. CAPPS II was a system developed by TSA to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. Despite controversy over privacy concerns, CAPPS II was scrapped in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists and screening passengers against a larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. TSA was urged to perform the screening instead of air carriers. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers and utilize the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). TSA implemented the Secure Flight program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights, which screens passenger information against terrorist watchlists. The TSDB, operational since 2011, screens passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. The database contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 in the subsets. The TIDE repository, with about 875,000 names, is a key data source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB. The expansion of TIDE was due to increased reliance post-2009 bombing attempt. The TSDB has over 500,000 identities as of 2012, with improved watchlist practices. The TSDB has expanded to over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints. Records are destroyed within seven days if no match is found, but potential matches are retained for 7 years. Secure Flight records are destroyed within seven days of travel completion, but potential matches are kept for 7 years. Known traveler lists are retained until updated, and lists of disqualified individuals are also kept. The system benefits from experience with the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) and cross-checks data against various databases. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on international travelers. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is used by CBP for risk assessments on international travelers. It compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential matches. Data in ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must electronically submit their information. Passenger data is transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information electronically. The information is checked against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses risk-based analysis from government and airline data. TSA's SPOT program aims to identify threats by observing behavior at airports, with concerns over its cost and effectiveness. The TSA's SPOT program faces controversy due to costs and questions about its scientific validity and effectiveness. It is based on behavior detection techniques rooted in law enforcement practices, but differs in its approach from traditional law enforcement behavior analysis tools. Law enforcement agencies typically use behavioral analysis for specific crimes and employ extensive interviewing methods, while SPOT focuses on observing behavior in large groups of individuals at airports. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. Reviews have questioned its effectiveness in identifying specific threats to aviation. The SPOT program has faced scrutiny for its effectiveness in identifying aviation threats. The Government Accountability Office found that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed. TSA conducted validation studies showing their techniques were more effective than random selection but did not release the study publicly for independent analysis. Despite positive validation study results reported by TSA, doubts persist from GAO and DHS Inspector General regarding the effectiveness of behavior detection in the SPOT program. GAO questioned the validity and utility of TSA's techniques, citing concerns about the metrics used to evaluate the program. TSA has taken steps to address recommendations for improvement but has not publicly released the study for independent analysis. The effectiveness of behavior detection in the SPOT program is questioned by GAO and DHS Inspector General. Metrics used to evaluate the program are criticized, with concerns about training and operational use of behavioral indicators. Lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data presentation to TSA's senior leadership are also highlighted. TSA's inconsistent refresher training for behavior detection officers is noted despite recommendations for improvement. TSA's behavior detection officers lack consistent refresher training, raising concerns about the program's effectiveness. Despite criticism, Congress has not taken action to eliminate or revamp the SPOT program. In contrast, the Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting low-risk passenger processing, has received more positive feedback since its launch in 2011. Efforts to implement Pre-Check, a trusted traveler program for low-risk passengers, have been well-received. Pre-Check started in 2011 and expanded in 2012, offering benefits to select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Registered Traveler program, launched in 2007 at 19 airports, allowed expedited screening for travelers with background checks. However, the program was dismantled in 2008 as TSA deemed the checks unnecessary. Pre-Check, a similar program started in 2011, now conducts extensive background checks again. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for expedited screening. The Pre-Check program provides a known traveler number for expedited screening, but participants may still undergo random thorough screenings. TSA faces challenges in authenticating boarding passes, which could lead to access issues at airports. TSA issued a system of records notice in 2013 for the public to apply for Pre-Check. The SORN outlines the process for individuals to apply for the Pre-Check program, requiring biographic and biometric data submission for security threat assessments. Eligibility criteria include criminal history checks and specific timeframes for disqualifying offenses. TSA may also reject applicants with extensive criminal records, even if not disqualifying. The TSA Pre-Check program requires applicants to undergo security threat assessments, including criminal history checks. Applicants may be rejected based on extensive criminal records, even if not disqualifying. A non-refundable $85 processing fee is required, and approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Applicants can appeal if deemed unqualified and must provide supporting records for corrections. TSA Pre-Check program allows travelers to undergo security assessments, including criminal history checks. An $85 fee is required, and approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. The program has received positive feedback from frequent flyers, with plans for expansion to 300 enrollment centers nationwide. Rapid expansion may limit benefits, with a goal of providing expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. The TSA Pre-Check program has expanded rapidly, with a goal of providing expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. Non-participating travelers may benefit from possible selection to use Pre-Check lanes through managed inclusion, which involves real-time threat assessments to identify low-risk individuals. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screening of passengers in the checkpoint queue. Passengers in the screening checkpoint queue may be randomly selected for managed inclusion in a Pre-Check screening lane. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, are allowed to use Pre-Check lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 years old can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Family members over 12 must either go through standard screening or independently obtain Pre-Check eligibility. Family members over age 12 must either go through standard screening lanes or independently obtain eligibility for the Pre-Check program. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will also be allowed expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are used for airline crewmembers participating in TSA's Known Crew Member initiative, verifying their credentials for expedited screening. Each sub-population undergoes background screening equivalent to TSA standards. The TSA considers military personnel, defense personnel, and airline crews to be lower risk individuals who undergo extensive background screening for expedited screening. Despite criticisms of the security clearance process, their credentialing process is seen as secure for verifying identity. Random selection for standard screening is still used for these individuals, adding an unpredictable element to the process. The TSA implements a risk-based approach to security by directing certain sub-populations to standard screening. Various forms of data are collected and retained, including biographic, biometric, and intelligence sources. Data is deleted when no longer needed, with records of potential threats retained for longer periods. Data voluntarily submitted, like in Pre-Check applications, is typically retained. The TSA collects and retains various forms of data, including biographic, biometric, and intelligence sources, for risk-based security programs. Data voluntarily submitted, like in Pre-Check applications, is typically retained and may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes. Personal data collected may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies for investigating potential violations, with protections under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974 and subsequent legislation require the protection of data against inappropriate handling or disclosure. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 established an Office of Appeals and Redress for those wrongly identified as threats. DHS maintains records of misidentified individuals and has a program, DHS TRIP, to address claims of inappropriate targeting. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) was established to address situations where individuals claim they were wrongly targeted. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS provides steps to resolve the issue. Passengers can appeal DHS decisions, but TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are not subject to judicial review. TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited processes. Individuals in connection with the Secure Flight program are largely exempt from judicial review. In January 2013, TSA released a market research announcement seeking information to expand expedited screening beyond the Pre-Check program by relying on third-party prescreening of passengers. The announcement raised concerns about privacy and data accuracy in using large commercial databases for passenger risk assessments. The use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening has raised privacy concerns and questions about data accuracy. Congress has previously restricted the use of commercial data in this process, but there are indications that various programs, such as CBP's ATS and Secure Flight, may already be using non-federal government and private databases for risk assessments. The New York Times article in October 2013 highlighted these concerns, noting that personal information may be used for purposes beyond counterterrorism. Congress has previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, but there are indications that TSA's risk-based approaches may involve utilizing commercial data. Congressional oversight is crucial in reviewing TSA's programs to ensure effectiveness and address privacy concerns. Congressional oversight plays a vital role in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening for effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. It is important to assess how well the risk-based approach can adapt to evolving threats and incorporate new methods. The evolution of processes to consolidate and disseminate terrorist watchlist information has been a key issue for the intelligence community since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on December 25, 2009. Specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged, and information regarding any evolution or adaptation of behavioral detection methods since the inception of TSA's behavioral detection program has not been publicly disclosed. Congressional oversight may be interested in how TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have adapted to shifting threats, changes in resources, and new procedures and technologies. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is a key issue for congressional oversight, with challenges in identifying suitable metrics due to security secrecy and limited encounters with terrorists. Concerns arise over false alarms in singling out potential threats, as the number of suspected terrorists is small compared to airline passengers. TSA's choice of metrics for programs like Pre-Check has been questioned, emphasizing efficiency over security effectiveness publicly. Efforts to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening have focused on systematic culling of terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these steps in reducing false alarm rates has not been publicly disclosed, raising concerns about oversight of TSA operations and appropriations. Assessing efficiency gains from risk-based screening initiatives is crucial for TSA oversight and appropriations. TSA expects $120 million in savings and 1,500 staff reductions in FY2015. Congressional oversight will evaluate if security is maintained. Privacy and data protection are key concerns for Congress, with DHS implementing practices to safeguard personal data. Questions remain on the integration of various programs in TSA's risk-based approach. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the debate continues on balancing privacy with effective risk-based strategies in aviation security. The approach must integrate various programs, adapt to evolving threats and resource changes, identify metrics for program effectiveness, address false positives impact, and ensure privacy and data protection. The potential for large-scale attacks targeting aviation still exists, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive risk-based strategy. The debate over balancing privacy with effective risk-based strategies in aviation security continues, with the potential for large-scale attacks remaining a central issue for policy and congressional oversight."
