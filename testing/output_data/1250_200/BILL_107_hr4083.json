    "content": "The \"Corporate Responsibility Act of 2002\" may require disgorgement. The Securities and Exchange Commission will prescribe regulations for disgorgement of various financial gains obtained by officers or directors through misconduct in filing false or misleading financial statements. Amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allow for judicial proceedings related to this matter. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission additional disgorgement authority in judicial proceedings against individuals involved in misconduct related to false or misleading financial statements or other violations of securities laws. In addition to other penalties, individuals involved in securities law violations may be required to disgorge any benefits received from the misconduct, including salary, commissions, fees, bonuses, and profits from securities transactions. SEC. 3. CEO AND CFO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DISCLOSURE. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires company executives to certify the accuracy of financial reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This certification includes confirming the review of the report, ensuring no false statements or omissions of material facts, and presenting financial information accurately. The signing officers are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls to ensure material information is known, evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls within 90 days, and disclosing to auditors and the audit committee. The signing officers must disclose significant deficiencies in internal controls and any fraud involving management. They also need to report on any changes in internal controls since their evaluation. The rules required by subsection (a) must address significant deficiencies and material weaknesses, with corrective actions. The deadline for these rules to be effective is 30 days after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF UNFIT CORPORATE OFFICERS. The text discusses the removal of unfit corporate officers in both judicial and administrative proceedings under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amendments are made to replace \"substantial unfitness\" with \"unfitness\" in relevant sections. Additionally, the Securities Act of 1933 is amended to grant the Commission the authority to prohibit individuals who have violated specific sections from serving as officers or directors of registered issuers. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to allow the Commission to prohibit individuals who have violated specific sections from serving as officers or directors of registered issuers."
