    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education services for children with disabilities. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all eligible children, identify and evaluate those with disabilities, create individual education programs (IEPs) for each child, and involve parents in the planning process. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide special education services for children with disabilities. Parents are essential partners in planning and overseeing their child's education as part of the IEP team. IDEA ensures children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled peers and provides procedural safeguards for parents, including due process hearings and appeals. The law was enacted in 1975 to address the need for education for children with disabilities. IDEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004. Congress is currently considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The report analyzes Supreme Court and lower court decisions related to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) since July 1, 2005. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and requires special education and related services. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court examined whether a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability. In Republic R-III School District v. the court determined that a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. The child's educational performance was significantly impacted by these conditions, leading to the need for special education services. In other court decisions, the question of whether a child with a minimal educational impact from a disability is covered by IDEA has been examined. For example, in L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, a child with Asperger's Syndrome was considered a child with a disability under IDEA despite having high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court ruled that a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and undisputed intellectual ability, was eligible for services. In another case, a child with schizophrenia was considered eligible due to missed school, incomplete assignments, and potential relapse in a public school setting. However, a child with ADHD, depression, and other disorders was deemed ineligible as her behavior did not significantly impact her education. Children with various mental health disorders such as reactive attachment disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, and dysthymic disorder were found ineligible for IDEA services as their behaviors did not adversely affect their educational performance. Court cases like Alvin Independent School District v. AD and Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District highlighted the requirement for a child's educational performance to be significantly impacted to qualify for IDEA services. The ninth circuit held in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that a school district failed to meet IDEA's child find requirement by not evaluating a ninth grader who failed all her classes. The issue presented to the Supreme Court is whether parents can file a due process complaint for negligence if school officials fail to arrange an educational program for a child with a disability. The core requirement of IDEA is that states must provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. FAPE is defined as special education and related services provided at public expense, under public supervision, and without charge. Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 was a seminal decision on FAPE requirements. The Court emphasized the importance of providing children with disabilities access to specialized instruction and related services tailored to confer educational benefit. It stated that FAPE is achieved through personalized instruction, support services, adherence to state educational standards, alignment with the child's IEP, and monitoring of educational progress. Mainstreaming was also highlighted as a factor in determining educational benefit. The IEP should be formulated to help the child achieve passing marks and advance grades, but states are not required to maximize potential. Progressing from grade to grade and making measurable gains meets the FAPE requirement. Courts must avoid imposing preferred educational methods on states, as determining educational benefit for children with disabilities is complex due to the wide range of disabilities. The Court's analysis in Rowley under IDEA remains key in determining the adequacy of educational benefits for children with disabilities. Lower courts have varied in interpreting Rowley, with some emphasizing access to education over educational progress. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the court found an IEP adequate despite minimal educational progress, leading to differing opinions on what constitutes a free appropriate public education. Some courts interpret IDEA's educational benefits differently. For instance, the Third Circuit in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 held that an IEP must provide more than minimal educational benefit. The Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. stated that an IEP must achieve meaningful educational benefits, outlining four factors to assess this standard. The courts have different interpretations of what constitutes educational benefit under IDEA. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, improved SAT scores and excellent grades were considered sufficient for FAPE. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit emphasized that above-average intelligence requires more than a negligible benefit. Procedural violations must impact the child's substantive rights to constitute a violation of FAPE. FAPE requires timely implementation of IEP services, with exceptions for certain procedural errors. Failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability or unilaterally scheduling an IEP meeting can constitute a denial of FAPE. The interpretation of educational standards under IDEA has evolved, impacting the application of FAPE. The term \"educational standards\" has evolved in recent years to refer to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know and be able to do in their education. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected this shift towards standards-based education, requiring IEPs to include present levels of educational performance, measurable annual goals, and high expectations for children with disabilities. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. Questions have been raised about the current application of Rowley in light of changes brought by the No Child Left Behind Act. Parents have argued that FAPE requirements have been affected by NCLBA, but unsuccessful attempts have been made to show a conflict between IDEA and NCLBA. The final regulations indicate that peer-reviewed research is required for specially designed instruction and related services under IDEA. Courts have addressed the challenge of reconciling this requirement with the educational benefit standard. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the court found that an eclectic approach was sufficient, emphasizing that courts should not impose their views on educational methods. After a child is identified as disabled, an Individualized Education Team writes an individualized education program. After a child is identified as disabled under IDEA, an Individualized Education Team creates an individualized education program (IEP) that must include present levels of achievement, annual goals, services provided, and integration with non-disabled peers. The IEP is crucial for implementing Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and has been the focus of legal decisions. Courts typically assess compliance with IDEA procedures and whether the IEP is reasonably designed to benefit the child educationally. The exact requirements of an IEP have been debated, with courts emphasizing that it doesn't need to be perfect but should be reasonably calculated to help the child. The adequacy of an IEP has been the focus of legal decisions, with courts emphasizing that it doesn't need to be perfect but should be reasonably calculated to benefit the child educationally. Courts have found that flaws in an IEP that do not compromise the child's right to an appropriate education or deprive them of educational benefits do not violate IDEA. The lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not necessarily invalidate it, and procedural violations that do not cause substantive harm are not considered violations of IDEA. In legal decisions, courts have emphasized that an IEP should be reasonably calculated to benefit the child educationally. Flaws in an IEP that do not deprive the child of educational benefits do not violate IDEA. However, an IEP that does not provide educational benefits is considered a violation. The participation of a regular education teacher on the IEP team is crucial to prevent a denial of FAPE. Courts have emphasized that an IEP should benefit the child educationally. Despite limited parental control over the IEP, courts have ruled in favor of parents in some cases. For example, in Shelby S. v. Conroe Independent School District, the Fifth Circuit allowed an independent medical evaluation without parental consent. The First Circuit also found an IEP not procedurally deficient due to incompleteness in Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District. Line-drawing in the IEP context is challenging, as seen in the difficulty of distinguishing healthy parental input from impermissible demands. Courts have ruled in favor of parents in IEP cases, emphasizing the importance of parental involvement and adherence to IDEA's procedural requirements. FAPE, defined as special education and related services, is a cornerstone of the act. Related services include transportation, speech-language pathology, audiology services, and more to enable children with disabilities to receive a free appropriate public education. Related services under IDEA include physical and occupational therapy, recreation, social work, school nurse services, counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic purposes. Two Supreme Court decisions have addressed related services, emphasizing the provision of necessary medical services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court ruled in favor of providing clean intermittent catheterization for a child with spina bifida. The Court held that services affecting both the medical and educational needs of a child must be provided under IDEA if the child has a disability requiring special education, the service is necessary for the child to benefit from special education, and a non-physician qualified person can provide the service. Tatro established a distinction between services requiring a doctor and those that could be provided by others. This led to the 1999 Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., involving a paralyzed child who needed extensive medical services, but the school denied the parents' request for these services. The Court rejected the school's proposed test for related services, stating that the medical services exclusion only applied to services provided by a physician or hospital. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs serving these children. Recent IDEA cases have emphasized the broad discretion of federal courts in defining related services. Recent IDEA cases have highlighted the broad discretion of federal courts in defining related services for children with disabilities. The courts have emphasized the importance of enabling children with disabilities to benefit from special education, including the requirement for education in regular classrooms with supplementary aids and services whenever possible. Additionally, courts have followed a two-pronged approach to determine if an Individualized Education Program (IEP) places a student in the least restrictive environment. In determining the least restrictive environment for a child with disabilities, the court must consider if the school has made efforts to accommodate the child in a regular classroom and the potential impact on other students. In a case where a child's disruptive behavior affected other students, the court upheld the decision that full-time education in a regular classroom was not feasible. Congress provided grants to states under P.L. 94-142 to support education for children with disabilities. In enacting P.L. 94-142, Congress provided grants to states for educating children with disabilities and set specific requirements for receiving federal funds. The law included a \"stay put\" provision to prevent expelling disabled children during disputes. The concept remains in the current version of IDEA. The Supreme Court addressed exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule in Honig v. Doe, involving emotionally disturbed children. The Supreme Court's ruling in Honig v. Doe emphasized that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed ones. However, schools can temporarily suspend students who pose an immediate threat to others for up to 10 days. In cases where parents refuse to change a dangerous child's placement, schools can seek judicial relief under section 1415(e)(2), known as a Honig injunction. This interpretation of IDEA did not resolve all concerns about discipline. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief regarding discipline for children with disabilities under IDEA. Amendments in 1994, 1997, and 2004 expanded the provision to include removal to alternative settings for bringing weapons, drugs, or causing serious bodily harm. Courts have also addressed the application of the stay put requirement during transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child to continue to receive conductive education until the dispute over its appropriateness for inclusion in her IEP was resolved. The Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, stating that children applying for initial admission to a public school program were not entitled to continue to receive services pursuant to their IFSPs. Other issues regarding the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, a move from a resource room to a classroom, and the appeals process in the courts. Sammons v. Polk County School Board raised the issue of whether a request for mediation invokes the stay put provision. The Eleventh Circuit held that the IDEA regulations limited the application of the stay put provision to the pendency of. The Eleventh Circuit clarified that the stay put provision in IDEA regulations only applies during administrative or judicial proceedings, not during mediation. Various cases have addressed issues such as private school placement, changes in placement, and the appeals process in courts. The Ninth Circuit clarified the stay put provision in IDEA regulations, stating that it applies throughout the appeals process. A case in Hawaii where public schools were shut down for fiscal reasons did not violate the stay put provision. Congressional interest in seclusion and restraints led to the passing of the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" The IDEA allows for positive behavioral interventions and supports to address behavior that hinders learning, without specifically prohibiting the use of seclusion and restraints for children with disabilities. State laws may dictate the use of restraints, but it must align with the child's IEP and consideration of positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. In Honig v. Doe, the Court examined IDEA's requirements for children with violent behavior, holding that a suspension longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA, cases have alleged violations of a child's right to education due to the use of restraints and seclusion. Courts have generally not found violations of IDEA when seclusion or restraint was necessary to prevent harm or when the child was progressing academically with tailored IEPs. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents challenged the use of seclusion and restraint procedures in their child's IEP. The Eighth Circuit ruled that parents must follow IDEA due process procedures before withdrawing their child from the school district. IDEA has also been used by parents to challenge a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The district court upheld the regulations, stating they were informed and rational choices consistent with the purposes of the IDEA. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE, with courts differing on the requirements for tying harassment claims to IDEA. Several courts have found that harassment claims must be tied to IDEA and show that FAPE was denied. Retaliation claims are subject to IDEA's exhaustion of administrative remedies. The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can also lead to actions for retaliation related to IDEA violations. Protecting the rights of special education students is considered a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act. IDEA's Section 615 provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including notice of rights, mediation, resolution sessions, and due process procedures. Due process complaints can be filed by parents or schools for violations occurring within two years of discovery. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for schools to file due process complaints within two years of discovering violations. A resolution session involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative was also mandated before due process hearings. Mediation and judicial enforcement of agreements were included in the law to resolve disputes. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization added provisions for due process complaints within two years of violations. It mandated a resolution session before hearings, allowing judicial enforcement of agreements. Court decisions have clarified confidentiality, attorney presence, and enforceability of settlement agreements in federal court. Courts have limited judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the court upheld a mediation agreement signed by parents represented by counsel, rejecting their claim of breach when the agreed-upon tutor could no longer transport the child. Similarly, in Ballard v. Philadelphia School District, a parent's argument against a settlement agreement was dismissed. IDEA requires due process complaints to include a description of the problem, relevant facts, and proposed resolution. Knight v. Washington School District addressed issues with meeting IDEA's pleading requirements. The court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination on a due process complaint not meeting IDEA's pleading requirements. The district court quoted Senate report language stating that the determination should be made based on the complaint itself, with no further hearing or appeal. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action without prejudice, noting that IDEA does not allow for a private right of action between LEAs and SEAs. In Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education, the Sixth Circuit ruled that LEAs cannot challenge a state agency's noncompliance with IDEA's procedural safeguards. The Ninth Circuit also held that LEAs have no private right of action under IDEA except for issues raised by parents. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District allowed parents to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District allowed parents to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, recognizing parents' independent, enforceable rights encompassing a child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA protects the rights of children with disabilities and their parents, ensuring both have procedural rights for protection. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District recognized parents' independent rights under IDEA, emphasizing their particular interest in the goals of the law. IDEA provides parents with both procedural and substantive rights, with the Court finding that concerns about increased lawsuits were not sufficient to challenge the law under the Constitution's Spending Clause. Additionally, IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies in cases where parents bring actions for improper purposes. The Supreme Court's recognition of parents' independent rights under IDEA in Winkelman v. Parma City School District has led to courts allowing parents to assert their own claims in cases involving educational agencies. However, parents cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees, and claims must be personal to the parents to be valid. Some courts have extended parental rights to cases under Section 504 and the ADA, but there is not universal agreement on this issue. Some courts have extended parental rights to cases under Section 504 and the ADA, but there is not universal agreement on this issue. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, the court found that Winkelman's emphasis on parental involvement in IDEA did not apply to Section 504 and the ADA. Other parental rights issues include the inability to recover damages under IDEA for lost earnings and suffering, as noted in Blanchard v. Morton School District. The Second Circuit addressed the rights of noncustodial parents in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City. IDEA defines the term \"parent\" and emphasizes that a parent is presumed to be the parent unless lacking legal authority for educational decisions. Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City highlighted the noncustodial biological parent's lack of legal authority. Besides IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA also address the education rights of individuals with disabilities. Each statute plays a significant role in the education of individuals with disabilities, with IDEA being a grants and civil rights statute, while Section 504 and the ADA are civil rights statutes prohibiting discrimination. The ADA and Section 504 are civil rights statutes that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal funds, the ADA has broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes in education has been examined by courts, noting differences in coverage. IDEA ensures the provision of FAPE through due process requirements, but does not specify burden of proof in hearings. The Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor emphasized that the burden typically falls on the party seeking relief unless Congress intended otherwise. Various arguments were considered, but ultimately, the burden was placed on the party with the natural advantage of information, which in this case was the school district. The Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor emphasized that the burden typically falls on the party seeking relief unless Congress intended otherwise. School districts were seen as having a \"natural advantage\" regarding information, but IDEA provides parents with rights to ensure the school bears no unique informational advantage. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools and who pays for them have been controversial under IDEA. A child with a disability may be placed in a private school by the local or state educational agency to fulfill the FAPE requirement. The cost is covered by the agency in this case. Parents can also unilaterally place their child in a private school, but the agency may be required to reimburse them if certain conditions are met. IDEA mandates some services for children in private schools, even if they are placed there by their parents without agency consent. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without receiving special education from the public school. In a 2007 decision, the Court allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand, stating that parents are entitled to reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts. The Supreme Court's 2007 decision did not set a precedent for lower courts regarding reimbursement for private school tuition when a child has not received public special education services. However, in 2009, the Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special education services if a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an adequate IEP, they are not entitled to private school placement or tuition reimbursement. In M.H. and J.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Central School District, the court found that parents are not entitled to tuition reimbursement for a private school placement if the child's IEP is adequate. Reimbursement for private school tuition may be barred if parents do not notify the LEA of issues with their child's IDEA services or if they act unreasonably with the school. If parents act unreasonably or if procedural violations do not cause harm, they may not be barred from private school tuition reimbursement. If a school district fails to provide a child with a disability FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education is awarded to compensate for inadequate programs, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. Lower courts have required compensatory services when financial reimbursement is allowed, but there is some ambiguity in this remedy. Courts have differed in how compensatory education is awarded under IDEA. Some courts grant it for the same amount of time services were withheld, while others focus on providing appropriate education. The IEP for children receiving compensatory education may require more services than a general IEP to compensate for the denial of appropriate education. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for rights deprivation, but exhaustion of IDEA procedural remedies is generally required before filing a \u00a71983 action. The application of section 1983 with damages for pain and suffering to IDEA is unclear. The IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before filing a \u00a71983 action. The application of section 1983 with damages to IDEA is unclear. Some courts allow damages, while others do not. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that prevailing parties under IDEA can only seek remedies within the statute. Congress enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 in response to the controversy surrounding the Court's decision. In response to the controversial decision in Smith v. Robinson, Congress enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986, providing for attorneys' fees under IDEA. Subsequent amendments in 1997 and 2004 allowed for reductions in fees and added provisions for attorneys' fees for state and local educational agencies. The ADA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, as seen in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources. In the Supreme Court case addressing attorneys' fees, the \"catalyst theory\" was rejected, stating fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. Buckhannon precedent applies to IDEA cases, awarding fees for prevailing parties in administrative and judicial proceedings. Fees have been granted for misclassification of disability but not for cases where disability is not yet determined under IDEA. Attorneys' fees under IDEA are not awarded for failure to refer for assessments or failure to identify a child as disabled. Fees are only awarded for relief obtained through a judicially approved settlement agreement. Parties must fulfill court-ordered duties to receive fees. Fees are not awarded for representation by consultants or parent-attorneys, but may be awarded to non-parent relatives. Courts have discretion in determining the amount of fees based on the party's level of success. Based on the level of success achieved, courts may award less than the full amount of attorneys' fees requested by a prevailing party. The Fifth Circuit ruled that refusal to attend a meeting when a proposed settlement was not offered does not justify reducing the award. Fee caps were first imposed on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia in FY1999, and have been included in subsequent appropriations acts. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows courts to award reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing party who is a State or local educational agency against the attorney of a parent. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, courts may award attorneys' fees to a prevailing State or local educational agency against a parent's attorney for filing a frivolous complaint. The fee-shifting provision does not apply to private schools, and unsuccessful lawsuits by parents are not automatically deemed frivolous. The Ninth Circuit emphasized the importance of not discouraging lawyers from taking on potentially meritorious IDEA cases. The fee-shifting provision allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing State or local educational agency against a parent's attorney for filing a frivolous complaint. Cases have examined whether the agency was the prevailing party, with examples where agencies did not prevail on educational issues and were not entitled to fees. The provision does not apply to private schools, and discouraging lawyers from taking on meritorious IDEA cases is emphasized. The Supreme Court held that IDEA does not allow prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts, despite some lower courts interpreting the language on attorneys' fees to include expert witness fees. The parents in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy argued that expert witness fees should be covered under the provision, but the Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, disagreed. The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts. The majority opinion stated that Congress enacted IDEA under the Spending Clause, requiring unambiguous conditions for state acceptance of funds. The legislative history was deemed insufficient to support the inclusion of expert witness fees. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to amend IDEA to cover expert witness fees. The Department of Education oversees the implementation of IDEA, with procedures in place for resolving disputes. Court decisions have addressed complaints under IDEA's due process procedures, including cases involving systemic violations. Congress established protection and advocacy systems to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities, often leading to class action lawsuits regarding special education students' rights and access to student records."
