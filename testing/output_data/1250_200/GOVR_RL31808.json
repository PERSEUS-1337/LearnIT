The Act totaled $89.8 billion with an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. An additional $1.1 billion was allocated for transportation and election reform projects. Congress passed a continuing resolution extending funding to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill, providing $85.8 billion. Key financial differences from the Administration request include an additional $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for grants-in-aid to airports. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill, providing $85.8 billion. This change is a result of the creation of a new federal department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the reorganization of the subcommittee structure of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Key agencies like the United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, and United States Secret Service were transferred to DHS. Budget numbers for years prior to FY2004 have been adjusted for comparison. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments was $85.9 billion, slightly below the FY2003 figure. The Transportation/Treasury Appropriations for FY2003-FY2004 were detailed in a table provided by the House Committee on Appropriations and House Report 108-243. The Senate's budget division differs from the House, with the Postal Service falling under \"Related Agencies.\" During deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety program was struck due to disputes over fund allocation methods. The House Committee on Appropriations provided details on Transportation/Treasury Appropriations for FY2003-FY2004. Disputes over fund allocation methods led to funding cuts for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety program, reducing total transportation funding in the bill.

The budget request for the Department of Transportation for FY2004 was $55.7 billion, aligning with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. The request proposed changes to highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. Figures in the appropriations table may differ slightly from the text due to supplemental appropriations and other funding actions. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over fund allocation: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million), reducing total transportation funding in the bill. These figures do not include across-the-board rescissions and additional authorizations, such as the Essential Air Service program. The FY2004 FMCSA appropriation was $81 million less than requested. The FY2004 appropriations for various transportation programs included funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System, grants for motor carrier safety activities, NHTSA's request with transferred funding from FHWA, Amtrak's repayment postponement, RSPA's total resources, and rescissions of unobligated contract authority.

In FY2003, $102 million was allocated for the program. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for EAS, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The Act does not rely on the overflight fee as its main funding mechanism. The bill rejects calls to reduce the size of the EAS program and require a local contribution at each airport receiving EAS service. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The Act does not rely on the overflight fee as its main funding mechanism. The House provision requiring communities receiving EAS assistance to report on program coordination and funding improvements was absent in the FY2004 Act. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for airport development and planning, with the House-reported bill recommending $3.425 billion for AIP. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account.

The Senate Bill (H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589; S.Rept. 108-146) provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with $33.8 billion set as the obligation limitation. Earmarking of funds for federal-aid highway discretionary programs was a common practice in both bills. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This represents an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total. The enacted FY2004 conference agreement heavily earmarks all discretionary programs under FHWA's control. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarked funds for various programs under FHWA, including core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and Highway Bridge Replacement. Over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds were earmarked for projects, with a 100% federal share for eligible projects. This marks a departure from past practices where federal shares were typically 80% or 90%.

The fund is administered by the Administrator of General Services to support projects approved by the director of OMB. Funding for the Electronic Government Fund was a contentious matter between the President and Congress in FY2003 and FY2002. The Blueprint proposed establishing an electronic government account with initial funding of $10 million in 2002, growing to $100 million over three years. The fund would support interagency e-gov initiatives, including a Public Key Infrastructure for secure online communications. The Bush Administration later doubled the fund to $20 million.

OPM is directed to certify that transferring DSS functions will not affect its workload, notify Committees of any delays in PBMs research, complete an audit on FEHBP costs, consider Hampshire and Hampden counties for Locality Pay Area, and conduct a study on Federal employees not covered by health insurance. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested, including funds for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. The Committee also addressed OPM's modernization program for its retirement system, urging OPM to collaborate with GAO for guidance and support. The Committee directed OPM to conduct quarterly meetings with GAO on the progress of the IT modernization project, but only one meeting occurred in 2002 and none in 2003. The Committee is disappointed by the lack of cooperation and directs GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on the problems and mismanagement of the project. The law provides an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, with specific directives for OPM to consider implementing the Federal Salary Council's recommendation. Additionally, an amendment was passed to prohibit funds from being used to implement regulations. Senator Grassley's amendment (No. 1949) prohibits funds from being used to implement OPM's proposed regulations limiting the time executive branch employees can spend in Congress. He argues that the proposed regulations hinder the ability of detailees to understand and contribute to the legislative process effectively.

The Administration's proposed language for these provisions can be found in the Appendix. The Administration's proposed language for government-wide general provisions can be found in the Appendix. Congress prefers reiterating existing provisions rather than placing them in permanent law. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes a 4.1% pay increase for federal white-collar employees under the General Schedule, retroactive to January 1, 2004. Employees under the General Schedule receive annual pay adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index. The pay increase for January 2003 was 4.1%, with an additional 1% applied to locality-based comparability payments. A similar situation occurred in January 2004 with a proposed 2.0% pay increase. The President's budget proposed a federal civilian pay increase of 2.0% in January 2004, with an alternative plan of 1.5% increase in basic pay and 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not completed action on legislation for other rates, so the President's plan took effect. The FY2004 budget resolution included a provision for civilian and military pay increases to be in parity. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 would establish a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, split between basic and locality pay at the President's discretion. The 4.1% federal civilian pay increase will be split with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at local prevailing rates. Congress has limited FWS wage adjustments in recent years to prevent exceeding General Schedule supervisor salaries. In high cost areas, FWS wages may exceed General Schedule supervisor salaries. Wages in lower cost areas can increase based on wage surveys, but high cost area wages will be capped. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. The Senior Executive Service salaries were changed under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, with minimum rates at $103,700 and maximum at $145,600. Those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive up to $158,100. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a performance component. A $500 million fund would reward top-performing individuals with permanent base pay increases. Members of Congress, Judges, and other federal officials are scheduled for a 2.2% pay adjustment effective January 2004, retroactively applied after a 1.5% limit was lifted. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, was limited to 1.5% under the Appropriations Act, 2004. However, the full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactively applied. The Senate voted against an amendment that would have denied the pay increase to Members of Congress. Pay adjustments are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment scheduled for January 2004. Unlike other officials, judges require specific authorization for their annual pay increase. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including judges, must be specifically authorized. Presidents now receive a salary of $400,000 per annum since 2001. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes in the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) to charge administrative costs to employing agencies, aiming to improve workplace safety. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, mainly paid by agencies with the highest number of claims like the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration proposed changes in the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) to charge administrative costs to employing agencies, aiming to improve workplace safety. Around 60% of FECA claims involve the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration supports competitive sourcing and objected to hindering amendments in H.R. 2989. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered some competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda and OMB has implemented initiatives to promote it since February 2001. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing as part of the President's Management Agenda since February 2001. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with competitive sourcing provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673. This section places conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, including the requirement to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). The time needed to complete an in-house cost estimate for streamlined competitions may hinder agencies from meeting the circular's 90-day deadline. Section 647(a) requires consideration of the conversion differential in competitions, which may override Circular A-76's guidelines. This section directs the competitive sourcing official to assess if contracting out the activity would be more cost-effective for the agency. The official would consider whether contracting out an activity would be less costly to the agency by $10 million or 10% of personnel costs, whichever is less. It is unclear how the cost of contractor performance should be compared to determine cost-effectiveness. Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities to Congress. Section 647(b) of Circular A-76 mandates executive agencies to provide annual reports to Congress on their competitive sourcing activities. Reports must include completed and ongoing competitions, associated costs, estimated and actual savings, projected FTEs for the next fiscal year, and details of the decision-making process. These reports can aid congressional oversight and inform OMB policy, but the lack of a standardized methodology for data collection may limit their usefulness and increase costs. Section 647(c) of Circular A-76 allows agency heads to issue letters of obligation to MEOs with performance periods longer than five years, potentially reducing the frequency of recompetitions. This provision could impact government agencies and private sector sources differently. Contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR, while longer performance periods could help with recruitment and retention issues for federal government employees. Another provision, Section 647(d), would also affect competitive sourcing activities. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring performance after public-private competitions. Section 647(e) prohibits moving contractor-performed work outside the US if previously done by federal employees within the country. This could impact contractor bids based on labor costs. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, but they were dropped in the final report. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba, including travel restrictions and financial transactions. US policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government through sanctions, including the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. Sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). There are differing opinions in Congress on how to approach U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, others calling for lifting certain sanctions, and still others pushing for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 included provisions to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel and remittances, as well as eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 included provisions to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel and remittances, including eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue, with certain categories of travelers allowed to visit under general or specific licenses. Supporters of the Flake amendment argued that U.S. policy toward Cuba restricts the rights of American travelers, while opponents warned that lifting travel restrictions would benefit the Cuban government financially. H.Amdt. 377 aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, with a limit of $3,000 in remittances allowed for travelers to Cuba. Cuba travel regulations were amended to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 per quarter limit for Cuban households. The Delahunt amendment aimed to lift the cap on remittances sent by Cuban Americans to their families in Cuba, but opponents feared it would benefit the Cuban regime. OFAC tightened regulations on people-to-people educational exchanges in March 2003, restricting non-academic exchanges. Some supported the restrictions as a means to control unrestricted travel, while others criticized the decision to limit ordinary people's travel to Cuba. The Senate took action on October 23, 2003, regarding restrictions on Cuba travel. A motion to prevent funds from enforcing these restrictions was defeated. Momentum behind easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support than in 2002. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support than in 2002. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, compared to a similar amendment in 2002 which had a vote of 262-167.

The curr_chunk contains abbreviations and acronyms related to various transportation programs and agencies such as FHWA, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations and acronyms related to various transportation programs and agencies within the DOT, including FHWA, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, and TSA. Funding for the DOT budget primarily comes from dedicated transportation trust funds, with the remainder sourced from other sources. The DOT budget is funded mainly by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and transit account, receive funding from specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending. Highway and transit programs are funded through contract authority from the highway trust fund, allowing funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. Funding guarantees were established, changing the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs by linking annual spending to revenue collections for the highway trust fund. It established funding guarantees that make it difficult to alter funding levels through the annual budget process. Additionally, TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 appropriations act allowed for some redistribution of funds among programs and added significant spending projects. In FY2001, more funds were added for earmarked projects and some funding was redirected between programs. The trend continued in FY2002 with major redistributions of funds, including transfers to agencies not eligible for funding under TEA-21. The FAIR21 (P.L. 106-181) provides a guarantee for FAA programs. The FAIR21 (P.L. 106-181) provides a guarantee for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending, different from TEA-21. It relies on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. While supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, observers see it as weaker than TEA-21 guarantees. Congress can waive points-of-order. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for specific agencies in constrained budget years. Transportation budgeting involves a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation budget spending were achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays. Contract authority, as specified in Title 23 U.S.C., allows authorized funds to be automatically available to states at the beginning of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. Appropriations are still required for outlays. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999-FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and receive federal payments after completion. Trust fund balances remain high to cover future commitments. Highway and transit accounts have significant short- and long-term obligations. The highway and transit accounts have substantial short- and long-term commitments, including payments for current fiscal year projects and outstanding obligations for future dates. There are unobligated amounts dedicated to projects but not yet committed. Apportionments distribute funds to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed administratively. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients. Highway program recipients may mistakenly assume that a state apportionment is part of the federal budget, even though apportionments and allocations are separate processes."
