    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". The findings by Congress highlight the significance of truancy as a warning sign for youth issues. Truancy is linked to high dropout rates, increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and lower salaries. It is also a common trait among criminals and is associated with high rates of daytime burglary and vandalism. A significant portion of violent juvenile crime occurs during school hours, with a majority of arrested children being truants. Some cities report alarmingly high rates of unexcused student absences, reaching up to 4,000 per day. (7) Some cities report up to 70% of daily student absences are unexcused, with a total of 4,000 absences per day.\n(8) Truancy incurs significant social and economic costs, with only 34% of inmates completing high school education.\n(9) Truants and dropouts cost the Nation $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes over their lifetimes.\n(10) Parents are often unaware of their child's truancy.\n(11) Effective truancy prevention programs can improve school attendance and reduce daytime crime rates.\n(12) There is a lack of targeted funding for truancy prevention programs in current law. \"GRANTS.\" In this section, definitions are provided for terms like eligible partnership, local educational agency, qualified unit of local government, and unit of local government. The government, including various political subdivisions and Indian tribes, can receive grants to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. Grants are awarded competitively, with a maximum amount of $100,000 per year. At least 25% of the grant must be used by the local educational agency. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 additional years and can be used for various purposes by the eligible partnership. Grant amounts under this section can be used to address truancy through parental involvement, sanctions for habitually truant students, parental accountability, in-school prevention programs, involvement of various community entities, and technology. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for model truancy intervention programs such as the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, the TABS program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Roswell Daytime Curfew Program in Roswell, New Mexico, the Stop, Cite and Return Program in Rohnert Park, California, the Stay in School Program in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Atlantic County Project Helping Hand in New Jersey. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for model truancy intervention programs in various states, including Connecticut, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Virginia, Ohio, California, New Mexico, and any other program deemed appropriate. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001 for this purpose."
