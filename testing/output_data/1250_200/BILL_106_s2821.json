    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\". It addresses the creditability of service. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 amends Section 8411 of title 5, United States Code to include service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between 1988 and 2000, under certain conditions. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 amends Section 8411 of title 5, United States Code to require employees or Members to deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposits made more than 5 years later must include interest, and if not made in full, the service remains creditable for annuity purposes. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 allows service of employees or Members to be fully creditable for annuity purposes, but any annuity based on this service will be reduced similar to section 8418(b). SEC. 3. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given upon submission of a written application by December 31, 2001. Any annuity or survivor annuity will be recomputed to include the service, effective for amounts accruing after 30 days from the application submission date. If the full deposit required under section 8411(j) of title 5 is not made timely, a reduction will be made in the recomputed annuity for the service. Interest is not included in the deposit. The Office of Personnel Management is required to notify individuals of their rights under the Act and assist them in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Corporation must provide information on an individual's service to the Office upon request."
