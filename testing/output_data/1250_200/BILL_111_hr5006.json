Congress finds that Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, was devastated by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on January 12, 2010. The earthquake caused massive destruction, affecting an estimated 3,000,000 people, nearly one-third of the country's population. Prior to the earthquake, Haiti was already struggling with recovery from previous natural disasters and food shortages. President Obama pledged unwavering support from the United States to aid in the recovery efforts. The global response to the earthquake in Haiti has been overwhelmingly positive, with individuals, businesses, and organizations providing support.
