    "content": "The \"Parental Choice in Television Act of 1995\" allows parents to have control over television programming for their children. The Congress finds that television has a significant influence on children's values and behavior, with some children exposed to up to 11 hours of TV a day. Studies show that exposure to violent programming can lead to aggressive behavior and the acceptance of violence as normal. Children in the United States are exposed to a high amount of violence and sexual content on television, which can negatively impact their attitudes and behavior. Parents are concerned about the influence of such programming and support technology to block harmful content. There is a governmental interest in empowering parents to limit these negative influences by providing them with information and tools to control what their children watch. The government aims to establish a Television Rating Code to identify and rate video programming containing harmful content. This code will empower parents to control what their children watch by providing information and tools to block violent or sexual programming. The government is implementing rules for distributors to transmit signals with ratings for video programming, allowing parents to block inappropriate content. Additionally, televisions in the US must have circuitry to block specific channels and programs based on ratings. The government is enforcing regulations on TV manufacturers and distributors to enable viewers to block channels and programs based on ratings. This includes rules for shipping or importing televisions with blocking technology, overseen by the Commission. The Commission oversees industry standards for blocking technology on TVs, ensuring they can receive rating signals. The Commission will adapt to new video technology to maintain blocking services for consumers. Amendments to the Act include adding new sections for compliance. The effective date for these changes is one year after the Act's enactment, pending Commission approval. The Commission will determine if distributors have established voluntary rules for rating video programming containing sensitive material before displaying it to children. They will also specify the effective date for implementing regulations in consultation with the television manufacturing industry."
