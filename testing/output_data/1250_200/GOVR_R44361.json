    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement as part of its Asia-Pacific strategy. The TPP aims to liberalize trade among 12 countries and requires Congress to pass implementing legislation. Proponents highlight the strategic importance of the agreement. The TPP's strategic significance lies in the U.S. using it to exert influence in the region and beyond, strengthening alliances, maintaining leadership in Asia-Pacific, enhancing national security, promoting trade liberalization, and establishing trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. China's role is also a key factor in analyzing U.S. influence in the region. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are crucial in the analysis of U.S. influence in Asia. Some view China's efforts as a way to minimize U.S. power, while others see the TPP as a means to maintain U.S. leadership and establish trade norms with China in mind. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to China could be counterproductive, as U.S. and Chinese trade goals may actually complement each other. The TPP involves balancing economic and political priorities, with critics focusing on its impact on the U.S. economy. Proponents emphasize the strategic implications, which are harder to quantify but significant. The report examines strategic arguments presented by the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents, focusing on implications for the Asia-Pacific region. It discusses the historical context of U.S. trade agreements and institutions, highlighting the strategic and foreign policy objectives behind FTAs with countries like Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, and Singapore. The first U.S. FTA in Asia with Singapore entered into force in 2004, emphasizing closer cooperation on combating terrorism. The TPP is seen as a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, with strategic importance for U.S. leadership and credibility in the region. The agreement is viewed as a test of U.S. commitment to shaping the global economic order and promoting inclusive development. The TPP is a signature economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, crucial for U.S. leadership and credibility. Approval by Congress is seen as essential to show commitment to the region's economic and diplomatic structures. Failure to pass the agreement could weaken U.S. standing and credibility in Asia. The TPP is crucial for U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. Failing to pass the agreement will hurt U.S. credibility worldwide. Proponents argue that the TPP is important for strengthening regional institutions and promoting cooperation. The agreement is also linked to broader diplomatic and security interests, with some comparing its significance to that of an aircraft carrier. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of passing TPP, comparing it to another aircraft carrier. Proponents believe the agreement will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics argue that security partnerships depend more on countries' security interests rather than trade agreements. The impact of trade deals like KORUS FTA on fundamental security interests is questioned, with factors like threats from China or North Korea playing a more significant role in alliance strength. The short-term strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance is influenced by perceptions of threats from China or North Korea, rather than the KORUS FTA. The future of the U.S.-Japan alliance is driven by Japan's strategic decisions, not the success of the TPP. The TPP could have a greater impact on countries like Vietnam, where approval could signal closer ties with the United States. Failure to approve the TPP may negatively affect Vietnam's perception of the U.S. The United States sees the approval of the TPP as a way to strengthen ties with Vietnam and promote a global order reflecting its interests and values. The agreement is believed to help establish a rules-based trading system and enhance security relationships in the Pacific region. Implementing the TPP would help solidify the United States' presence in the Pacific region, signaling its commitment to the area. Failure to do so could be perceived as a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in Asia, potentially allowing other countries like China to fill the influence vacuum. U.S. credibility in Asia is currently being questioned amidst China's rise and North Korea's threats, making the TPP crucial for maintaining U.S. influence in the region. The TPP is crucial for maintaining U.S. influence in the Pacific region amidst China's rise and North Korea's threats. It aims to promote economic growth, advance U.S. interests, and shape trade and investment efforts globally. If rejected by Congress, trust and cooperation could be lost, impacting relationships like that between the U.S. and Japan. The TPP aims to update trade rules and address new barriers to influence future negotiations. The U.S. seeks to update the rules-based trading system through multilateral fora and rounds of negotiations. This led to the establishment of the WTO. The current WTO multilateral trade negotiations, known as the WTO Doha Development Agenda, have stalled due to differences among members. Global commerce has evolved with technology, leading to the need for new trade rules addressing digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Countries like the United States are pursuing new trade agreements like the TPP, which aims to create a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines. The TPP's economic importance could increase as new countries join and adhere to its provisions. The TPP's economic significance could grow as new countries join and adhere to its provisions, potentially promoting U.S. goals such as worker rights and environmental protection. Proponents believe the agreement could create competitive pressure for non-members to liberalize trade and investment, as seen with Japan's involvement in response to the U.S. FTA with South Korea. However, some note that the TPP currently excludes some of Asia's largest economies. The TPP's economic significance could increase as new countries join, potentially promoting U.S. goals like worker rights and environmental protection. Some experts argue that the TPP may not create a comprehensive set of trade rules in the Asia-Pacific as it excludes some of the region's largest economies. Several Asian countries have expressed interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members, including Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. Taiwan has also shown interest in membership. Many countries, including U.S. FTA partners like South Korea and Colombia, may seek entry into the TPP in the near future. FTA partners in Asia and Latin America, such as South Korea and Colombia, are likely candidates to join the TPP soon. Proponents believe mega-regionals like the TPP could influence global trade negotiations and set new standards beyond the WTO. Critics fear that focusing on bilateral and regional agreements could hinder multilateral efforts and weaken the WTO's role in trade liberalization. Mega-regionals may complicate the trading system further. The WTO's role in future trade liberalization could be affected by mega-regionals creating overlapping rules instead of multilateral ones. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant negotiation in the Asia-Pacific region, involving ASEAN members and six other nations. The United States is not part of RCEP negotiations, and potential differences with the finalized TPP are being considered. The comparison between ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP indicates potential differences in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental provisions, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises. Some view RCEP as an alternative or challenge to the TPP, while others see them as complementary for regional economic growth. Compatibility and synergy between the two agreements are important, especially for the seven countries involved in both RCEP and the TPP. The impact of these regional undertakings on existing trade remains uncertain. The TPP and RCEP are two regional agreements that may affect existing trade architecture in the region. The TPP negotiations are more advanced than RCEP, but a delay in TPP ratification could change the sequencing. Both agreements involve countries that are members of APEC, which has discussed the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. China plays a significant role in debates about the TPP and U.S. policy in Asia. China's inclusion in or exclusion from the TPP may have important implications for the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. Some argue that China is trying to minimize U.S. presence and power in the region, and the TPP is seen as a necessary means of countering this effort. The proposed TPP would allow the U.S. to shape regional economic development in line with its interests by creating rules and norms. The proposed TPP aims to shape regional economic development in line with U.S. interests by creating enforceable standards and norms. It is believed that the TPP's economic importance could influence China's decisions in ways favorable to U.S. interests. President Obama highlighted the potential impact of the TPP on China's adherence to international norms. Additionally, a completed TPP could encourage China to further liberalize its economic and trade regime and provide political cover for reformers in China. Some in China argue that the TPP could be used to constrain Chinese interests, leading to potential responses that may not align with U.S. interests. They also emphasize that China's economic initiatives could benefit regional development, and opposing them could be seen as obstructionist. Additionally, they point out that other Asian nations have their own trade policies and may not adopt policies that do not serve their interests, regardless of their origin. China's leaders aim to strengthen their nation's economy and global role through initiatives like the \"One Belt, One Road\" project, which includes the Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road. They are also establishing new financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to support these efforts. China is actively involved in various initiatives such as the \"One Belt, One Road\" project and the establishment of new financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to support economic development projects. Chinese leaders are also working towards increasing the use of the renminbi overseas, reforming multilateral institutions, and promoting regional trade agreements like RCEP as a foundation for a broader FTAAP. They aim to enhance China's global economic stature and influence by offering alternative models for development banks. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are mirrored in diplomatic and security spheres, aiming to reduce U.S. influence. China's actions include refashioning CICA and reclaiming disputed reefs in the South China Sea to counter U.S. power. China's stance on the TPP has evolved as more countries join the negotiations. China's views on the TPP have evolved as more countries joined the negotiations. Initially, China saw the TPP as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. However, China's criticisms softened after Japan joined the talks, with Chinese officials stating that a TPP agreement would be incomplete without China's involvement. China has expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP. China's evolving views on the TPP have shifted towards openness to negotiations. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed willingness for China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials cite challenges in meeting the agreement's standards. President Obama mentioned China's interest in participating in the TPP, indicating a potential for deeper integration to establish new trade rules. Analysts suggest that the U.S. aims to subject China to higher-standard rules through the TPP, discouraging attempts to weaken existing trade regulations. The official argues that the TPP could subject China to higher-standard rules and discourage attempts to weaken trade regulations. The US is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially facilitate China's participation in the TPP. Congress plays a direct role in guiding TPP negotiations and will consider the agreement and its strategic elements. Key issues for Congress to examine include whether the TPP aligns with broader foreign policy goals. TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. By encouraging nations to accept TPP rules, the US aims to reinforce its leadership, support reform, and shape a more US-friendly foreign policy outlook. Congress needs to consider these strategic arguments and weigh the agreement's implications carefully. The TPP's strategic implications are a critical consideration for Congress, potentially impacting U.S. leadership in Asia. The agreement's ultimate strategic impact may hinge on membership expansion and striking a balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. The TPP's strategic implications for U.S. leadership in Asia are crucial. Congress must consider the balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. Failure to ratify the agreement could setback U.S. goals and impact credibility in the region. The TPP's exclusion of key Asia-Pacific countries raises concerns about strategic and economic implications. The TPP's exclusion of key Asia-Pacific countries raises concerns about strategic and economic implications. Observers urge the U.S. to broaden economic engagement in the region beyond TPP membership to avoid neglecting other countries. Congress should consider expanding economic initiatives in Asia to enhance U.S. influence and commitment. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations like the TPP may impact the multilateral trading system. The TPP's exclusion of key Asia-Pacific countries raises concerns about strategic and economic implications. Observers urge the U.S. to broaden economic engagement in the region beyond TPP membership to avoid neglecting other countries. Congress may wish to consider whether the proposed TPP will further eventual WTO multilateral trade liberalization or lead to greater fragmentation of the global trading system."
