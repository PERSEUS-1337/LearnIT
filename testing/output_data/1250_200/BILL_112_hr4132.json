    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress finds that the FDA plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted medicines for serious diseases, utilizing innovative drug development strategies. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using modern tools and endpoints. This can lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising safety standards. Patients benefit from quicker access to innovative therapies. The FDA should enhance its authority to expedite the development and access to novel treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases. Congress believes that the FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to speed up the availability of treatments while maintaining safety standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. The Secretary will expedite the review of a new drug designated as a fast track product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and shows potential to address unmet medical needs. The sponsor of the drug can request this designation, and within 60 days of the request, the Secretary will determine if the drug qualifies. The Secretary will determine if a drug qualifies as a fast track product for expedited development and review if it meets specific criteria. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on its effect on a surrogate endpoint predicting clinical benefit. The FDA may approve a product for expedited development and review if it shows a significant effect on a surrogate endpoint predicting clinical benefit or a clinical endpoint that can predict irreversible morbidity or mortality. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to confirm the predicted effects. The FDA may approve a product for expedited development and review based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint predicting clinical benefit or irreversible morbidity/mortality. Approval may require post-approval studies to confirm predicted effects and submission of promotional materials for review. Withdrawal of approval can occur if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently. The FDA may approve a product for expedited development and review based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint predicting clinical benefit or irreversible morbidity/mortality. Approval may require post-approval studies to confirm predicted effects and submission of promotional materials for review. Withdrawal of approval can occur if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently. If the Secretary determines a fast track product may be effective, they can evaluate and commence review of portions of the application before it is complete. The Secretary can commence review of a drug application before it is complete if the applicant provides a schedule for submission of necessary information and pays any required fees. Any agreed time period for review does not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary is also required to develop and disseminate information on accelerated approval and fast track processes to relevant parties. The Secretary is required to establish a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints, biomarkers, and other scientific methods to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance and amendments to regulations within one year of the draft guidance. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases or conditions. The guidance must address incorporating novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints for rare diseases, without delaying the review or approval process for designated drugs. The Secretary will contract an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. The evaluation will involve consultation with various stakeholders. The amendments aim to encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
