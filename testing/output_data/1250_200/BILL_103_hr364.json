    "content": "The \"Small Business Meat Producer and Marketer Protection Act of 1993\" amends the Small Business Act by adding conditions for credit and reasonable rates. It also addresses marketing conditions detrimental to a free and competitive business environment in the livestock and meat industry. The Act aims to address issues in the livestock and meat industry that impact commerce, competition, and the free flow of goods. It defines commerce as trade among states and livestock as specific animals. The Act's policy is to eliminate these conditions without hindering production or distribution. The Meat Inspection Act defines key terms such as livestock, meat food products, meatpacker, meat marketer, and person. It also specifies that a meatpacker or meat marketer engaged in commerce is involved in trade between states or has employees engaged in production. Sec. 4 of the Meat Inspection Act prohibits meatpackers engaged in commerce from slaughtering more than a specified number of cattle, swine, or sheep at one location in a calendar week. It is unlawful for meatpackers or meat marketers to offer for sale or purchase more than a specified number of livestock in a calendar week, owned by them or by any person owning more than 5% of voting power or control. It is unlawful for meatpackers or meat marketers to have control over livestock for future delivery on a board of trade, or to select delivery dates more than twenty consecutive calendar days. Any violation of these provisions is subject to penalties. Any violation of section 4 of this Act incurs a fine of up to $50,000 or more per head of livestock exceeding the permitted number. Each week of violation is considered a separate offense. This Act is considered an antitrust law under existing legislation. The Act incurs fines for violations, considered an antitrust law. If a provision is invalid, it does not affect the rest of the Act."
