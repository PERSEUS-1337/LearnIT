Congress finds that the United States needs a strong scientific and technical enterprise, requiring more scientists and engineers. The education system must encourage students to study science and math, as current performance lags behind international peers. The US must recommit to leadership in science, math, and engineering, especially with advancements like nanotechnology. Loan forgiveness programs are needed to attract talent. A loan forgiveness program is essential to attract students to careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, including teaching, to help the United States maintain its technological leadership amidst advancements in nanotechnology. Establishment of program for loan forgiveness in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology fields to support technological leadership in the United States.
