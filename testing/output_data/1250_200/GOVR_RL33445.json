Political events in both countries influenced the talks, with the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and Malaysia's general elections impacting the negotiations. The Bush Administration aimed to conclude the talks before the end of its term, while Malaysia saw no rush to finalize the agreement in 2008.

Minister Muhyiddin later indicated that the FTA negotiations were postponed at the request of the United States until after the presidential inauguration. Key unresolved topics in the negotiations include intellectual property rights. Several key issues have emerged in the FTA negotiations between Malaysia and the United States, including intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, market access for U.S. automobiles and agricultural goods, trade in services, and government procurement policies. Malaysia has tightened its IPR regulations, but challenges remain, with software piracy at 59% in 2007. The USTR has noted Malaysia's efforts to improve IPR enforcement but stated that further improvements are needed. Malaysia has made improvements in IPR protection and enforcement, including the creation of a specialized IPR court in 2007. However, challenges remain, particularly in negotiations with the U.S. over the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement and concerns about \"TRIPs plus\" provisions for pharmaceuticals. Opposition in Malaysia has arisen regarding potential patenting of anti-retroviral AIDS drugs under the FTA, which could make them unaffordable for HIV/AIDS patients. Malaysia has used TRIPs provisions to provide low-cost anti-retroviral drugs to HIV/AIDS patients.

Malaysia protects its automobile industry from foreign competition with high tariffs and trade barriers. Malaysia protects its automobile industry with high tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, favoring national cars like Proton and Perodua. The government has started dismantling some protections to comply with WTO and ASEAN agreements, but excise taxes still hinder open trade. Tariffs of 30% are imposed on assembled vehicles from outside ASEAN, with excise taxes ranging from 80-200% on automobiles. Malaysia may raise concerns about U.S. measures protecting its domestic automobile industry during negotiations.

Discussions on trade in agricultural goods and SPS measures in July 2008 talks. Financial services pose challenges in negotiations, with Malaysia limiting foreign ownership in banks and insurance companies. Malaysia attempted to keep financial services in the lead-up to FTA negotiations. In financial services, Malaysia has lifted requirements for foreign banks, allowed them to seek any amount of credit without approval, and permitted the ringgit exchange value to float. Concerns about foreign participation in the financial sector have been reignited due to the recent US financial crisis. In telecommunications, foreign companies can acquire up to a 30% equity stake in fixed line operations. Licensed professionals like lawyers and architects also face restrictions in Malaysia. In Malaysia, restrictions benefit government-controlled firms like Telekom Malaysia. Licensed professionals such as lawyers, architects, and engineers face limitations.

The United States has offered limited access to its government procurement market to maintain negotiations. The United States has offered limited access to its government procurement market, worth approximately $250 billion, to maintain negotiations with Malaysia.

The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA is of interest to Congress due to the need for approval, potential trade liberalization, controversial provisions, and impact on trade flows affecting U.S. businesses and farmers. Senator Max Baucus welcomed the agreement in response to the USTR's 2006 FTA announcement.

Abdullah urged Muslims worldwide to combat extremism and enhance relations with the West, promoting Malaysia's moderate Islam. The proposed FTA between the United States and Malaysia aims to strengthen shared interests, including counterterrorism, defense, and education. Opposition to the FTA has emerged from various groups in both countries, including labor unions and environmental organizations. The AFL-CIO opposes additional FTAs without protections for workers' rights and environmental standards. Labor organizations are pushing for meaningful protections for workers' rights and environmental standards in bilateral free trade agreements. They want agreements to include enforceable protections for core workers' rights, bring labor laws up to International Labor Organization standards, and have a dispute settlement mechanism to prevent partner countries from reversing labor gains. Barack Obama has expressed support for these concerns, particularly regarding FTAs with Colombia and South Korea. Labor conditions in Malaysia have faced international criticism.

Concerns about labor and environmental standards have been raised by Public Citizen. Complications in the negotiations could arise due to Malaysia's lack of diplomatic relations with Israel and the need for export licenses for goods sent to Israel. U.S. law has provisions to counter boycotts and trade embargoes against Israel. Opposition concerns in previous FTAs have been addressed through legislative measures or commitments from the Administration. For example, in the DR-CAFTA, the Bush Administration addressed opposition by promising actions to mitigate adverse effects, such as allocating funds for labor and environmental enforcement capacity building assistance. The Bush Administration promised funding for labor and environmental enforcement capacity building assistance in the DR-CAFTA. Free trade agreements aim to reduce trade barriers, including tariffs, import quotas, and non-tariff barriers. FTAs also address services, investment, intellectual property protection, government regulations, and dispute settlement. Free trade agreements (FTAs) address government regulations, dispute settlement, business visas, and competition policy. Winners of FTAs are exporters, investors, and consumers, while losers are companies and workers in import-competing industries. FTAs can impact non-party countries through trade creation or diversion. The United States has FTAs with Singapore, Australia, and is negotiating with South Korea. A Trade and Investment Framework Agreement was signed with Malaysia in 2004. Past FTAs with Malaysia include tariff-free trade with a phase-in period for sensitive sectors. FTAs negotiated by the United States usually provide for tariff-free trade with a phase-in period for sensitive sectors. The majority of current U.S. exports to Malaysia, such as semiconductors and computer parts, are covered by the Information Technology Agreement. An FTA with Malaysia would open markets restricted by tariffs and non-tariff barriers, impacting products like motor vehicles, polyethylene, and motorcycles. The potential impact of an FTA depends on various factors, including the size of the two nations and their bilateral trade flows. Malaysia's key economic indicators show it as one of the fastest-growing economies, with a GDP and per capita income higher than many countries. The United States is Malaysia's largest trading partner and foreign investor, with Malaysia being the tenth largest trading partner of the U.S. in 2007. According to U.S. trade figures, Malaysia was the tenth largest trading partner of the United States in 2007. U.S. exports to Malaysia remained steady at about $10 billion per year from 2000 to 2005, but rose to over $10 billion in 2007. FTAs can divert trade towards involved countries, create more trade overall by lowering tariffs, and cause a substitution effect with imports replacing domestic production. U.S. investment in Malaysia totaled $1.8 billion in the first 10 months of 2008, making it the second greatest foreign investor after Australia. According to U.S. trade figures, U.S. exports to Malaysia remained steady at about $10 billion per year from 2000 to 2005, but rose to over $12.5 billion in 2006 and then declined to $11.7 billion in 2007. U.S. imports from Malaysia grew from 2001 to 2006, but then declined in 2007. Malaysia's exports to the United States rose from just over $20 billion in 2000 to about $30 billion in 2006\u2014an increase of nearly 50%\u2014and then slipped to $27.5 billion in 2007. Malaysia's imports from the United States rose 20% from $13.6 billion in 2000 to $16.4 billion in 2006 and then declined by nearly $500 million in 2007. Malaysia's resulting trade surplus with the United States was $6.5 billion in 2000 and $11.6 billion in 2006\u2014roughly $8-$10 billion less than the U.S. figures. According to Malaysian export data, the United States is Malaysia's top export market, followed by Singapore, Japan, and China. Malaysia's exports to the United States have decreased from 19.7% to 15.6% in the last three years, while China's share has increased from 6.6% to 8.8%. Japan remains Malaysia's top source of imports, with China and Singapore surpassing the United States as suppliers. Malaysia has FTAs with Japan and Singapore and is negotiating with other countries. The proposed FTA with the United States aims to level the playing field for U.S. exporters compared to other leading trading partners of Malaysia. Malaysia is not a major services trading partner for the United States, with total services trade amounting to less than $2 billion per year. Despite this, U.S. service sectors have shown interest in accessing Malaysia's domestic market. The United States is Malaysia's top export market for merchandise goods, and a U.S.-Malaysia FTA could strengthen this relationship and provide better access for U.S. services providers. The U.S. companies have invested over $15 billion in Malaysia, with a focus on manufacturing sectors like computer and electronic equipment. U.S. investors have also shown interest in chemical manufacturing operations in Malaysia. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA aims to strengthen this relationship and provide better access for U.S. services providers to Malaysia's domestic market. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA implementing bill faced challenges due to the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority. Congress could consider the FTA under a new TPA law, provide temporary TPA, or review it without TPA as done with the U.S.-Jordan FTA. Congress could consider the proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA without Trade Promotion Authority, similar to the approach taken with the U.S.-Jordan FTA. This would allow for potential amendments to the implementing bill and consultations with the Executive Branch during negotiations. Various legislative policy options include oversight hearings, consultations with interest groups, and working on U.S. trade policy with Malaysia and other nations. Close consultations with the Executive Branch could lead to changes in the draft agreement before signing.

In non-agricultural products, Malaysia's average MFN tariff rate is 8.7%, compared to the US's 4.0%. In Malaysia, tariff rates are particularly high in sectors where the government is promoting industry growth. For transport equipment, the average tariff rate is 25.6%, for non-electrical machinery it is 6.3%, and for electrical machinery it is 9.2%. Average applied tariff rates are indicators of a nation's actual level of tariff protection, which can be lower or higher than MFN rates due to various factors.
