    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods they produce less efficiently, leading to higher living standards. Trade allows for importing goods and services to boost consumer welfare, with many U.S. imports containing domestic components. Consumers benefit from trade by accessing a wider variety of goods at lower costs. Trade benefits consumers by providing access to a greater variety of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, and controlling inflation. Producers benefit from trade by accessing lower-cost inputs and overseas markets for exports, leading to increased competitiveness and opportunities for economies of scale. Trade also promotes innovation, investment in research and development, and supports increased productivity and economic growth. The concept of comparative advantage, developed by economist David Ricardo in the 19th century, remains relevant in explaining the mutual benefits of specialization and trade among countries. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries can benefit from specialization and trade. By focusing on producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage, countries can trade for goods they produce less efficiently, leading to mutual gains. Ricardo's theory emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost rather than absolute cost in determining trade patterns. Subsequent economic theories have built upon and refined the concept of comparative advantage. Economic theories have expanded on and qualified the theory of comparative advantage, examining trade patterns in the 21st century with the rise of global value chains and digital trade. Differences in comparative advantage between countries arise from factors of production like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries are expected to have comparative advantage in activities that use their abundant factors of production. The United States has a comparative advantage in high-skilled labor-intensive goods like aircraft due to its abundance of high-skilled labor. Differences in technology among countries can also impact comparative advantage. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies that indirectly nurture advantages (e.g., eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights) or directly support specific industries (e.g., subsidies, tariffs). The government can influence comparative advantage through policies like subsidies or tariffs to promote strategic industries. Protectionist policies may distort trade flows and hinder the development of competitive industries. Intra-industry trade between advanced economies suggests trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Trade patterns can be influenced by economies of scale, where production processes become more efficient at larger scales. Countries tend to specialize in producing and trading a subset of goods due to limited productive capacity. Trade impacts employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living. Overall, trade is seen as beneficial for economic well-being, leading to more efficient resource use, competition, economies of scale, lower prices, and increased consumer choices, ultimately boosting GDP. Trade can boost GDP through increased competition, efficiency gains, and consumer welfare. While liberalizing trade has reduced extreme poverty, the benefits are not evenly distributed. Trade can disrupt sectors, leading to job losses and stagnant wages in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, but agree that policies facilitating adjustment and compensation for those harmed are more economically efficient than protective measures. Trade can disrupt sectors, leading to job losses and stagnant wages in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, but agree that policies facilitating adjustment and compensation for those harmed are more economically efficient than protective measures. Adjustment assistance for those potentially displaced is crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Trade creates and destroys jobs, causing job churn, and can have different effects on workers in different occupations, known as occupational exposure to trade. Trade liberalization can shift jobs between sectors and within the same industry, impacting the economy at large. Trade can lead to job shifts within industries and across the economy, with some workers facing job displacement and reduced wages due to trade liberalization. Studies show that increased import competition, particularly from China, has negatively impacted local labor markets and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Despite job losses attributed to trade being a small share of total job losses annually, the short-run costs for workers switching occupations or industries can be substantial. International trade can impact U.S. labor markets and manufacturing jobs, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate often moving together. Studies show that trade can affect worker wages and income inequality, but there is no consensus on the overall impact. Other factors like technological change may have a larger effect on wages. Many studies have found that trade can impact worker wages and income inequality, with technological change having a larger effect on relative wages. Trade tends to increase returns to capital and high-skilled workers while decreasing returns to low-skilled labor. Imports from countries like China can negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. U.S. workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, leading some multinational corporations to shift labor-intensive production overseas. On the other hand, export-oriented industries in the U.S. tend to pay higher wages on average. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor migration. Scholars date the start of this globalization period to post-World War II, with global trade increasing from 25% to 57% of global GDP from 1960 to 2017. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. The stock of global foreign direct investment (FDI) also grew significantly during this period. The integration of the world economy has been facilitated by advances in transport and communication, as well as policies that have reduced barriers to international exchange. There is ongoing debate about the inclusivity and impact of globalization on inequality. Global value chains (GVCs) are interconnected organizations, resources, and processes that deliver products to consumers, often organized by multinational corporations. Global value chains (GVCs) are interrelated organizations, resources, and processes that create and deliver products to consumers, often organized by multinational corporations. GVCs involve assembling parts and components from multiple countries, driving globalization and trade. Foreign value-added share in exports has increased, highlighting the importance of GVCs in the global economy. The international fragmentation of production through Global Value Chains (GVCs) has increased trade levels and blurred the distinction between exports and imports. This has made it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade and interpret bilateral trade balances. Analysts predict fundamental shifts in GVCs that will shape future globalization and policy challenges. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a significant driver of trade, as it complements trade and investment flows. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade by creating global value chains through multinational corporations (MNCs). This leads to increased inter- and intra-firm trade, where parent companies and foreign affiliates exchange components to produce final products. U.S. firms invest abroad to access foreign markets and understand customer preferences. Firms establish operations abroad to be close to customers and access local markets. Global integration through trade and investment can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. Some U.S. MNCs focus on high-end activities like R&D while outsourcing other functions. Globalization and trade liberalization can lead to lower labor costs for U.S. multinational corporations by outsourcing production abroad. This shift may impact U.S. employment rates, with potential volatility in worker incomes and job sectors. Wealth distribution may also be affected, with lower-skilled workers facing wage dampening due to foreign competition. The OECD suggests that globalization accounts for at least 10% of the decline in the labor share of national income in advanced economies. Globalization, particularly through delocalization and import competition, has contributed to rising U.S. wage inequality by 10% to 20%. Most-favored-nation treatment in the WTO requires equal trade benefits among member countries, with some exceptions for preferential trade agreements. \"Trade agreements outside of the WTO can grant additional preferences, including special treatment for developing countries. National treatment ensures nondiscrimination between domestic and foreign products, services, and intellectual property rights. Most-favored nation status guarantees equal treatment for trading partners, with lower duty rates for countries with this status. Cuba and North Korea do not have permanent normal trade relations with the United States.\" The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries without NTR status. Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR to countries restricting emigration. WTO requires MFN treatment to all members. HTSUS determines tariffs on imported goods based on WCO codes. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) uses a structure of tariff classification based on standard commodity codes developed by the World Customs Organization. It groups products into 96 chapters with increasing detail as the digits increase. The HTS further subdivides products into unique tariff lines for the United States, with rules of origin determining product nationality. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code, which is kept up to date by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the nationality of imported products and play a key role in assessing duty rates and eligibility for trade programs. In today's global economy, determining a product's origin can be complex due to parts sourced from multiple countries. The United States negotiates different ROO in free trade agreements to ensure tariff benefits go to eligible partners, with some rules crafted to protect import-sensitive industries, like the \"yarn-forward\" rule for apparel. The yarn-forward rule in free trade agreements requires fabric used in apparel to come from FTA partners, impacting the U.S. industry. Global trade has been a significant driver of the economy, but recent years have seen a slowdown due to various factors like weak import demand and China's shift towards a consumption-driven economy. Global trade growth has rebounded, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO projected a trade growth rebound for 2018 and 2019, but now expect a slowdown due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Restrictive trade measures by the US and its partners are affecting trade flows and business outlooks. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. U.S. exports and imports combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. In 2017, U.S. exports and imports of goods and services were equivalent to 27% of GDP. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. U.S. exports have grown over 40% in the past decade, while imports have grown over 20%. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States, with most of U.S. global trade conducted with countries without free trade agreements. Multinational corporations produce worldwide, leading to complex value chains that make interpreting trade data challenging. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production. The production of goods and services involves complex value chains that make interpreting trade data challenging. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production, leading to an inflated bilateral trade deficit between countries like the U.S. and China. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) attempts to identify the origin of value added in goods and services, showing that U.S. imports from China actually comprise imports from many countries. The trade deficit, as measured by Trade in Value-Added (TiVA), attempts to identify the origin of value added in goods and services. In 2011, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third if bilateral trade flows were measured this way. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, indicating that the nation consumes more than it produces. The United States has had trade deficits annually since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017, driven by goods trade. The U.S. trade deficit in goods was $807.5 billion in 2017, driven by goods trade. The U.S. services trade surplus was $255.2 billion. The current account deficit was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006. The deficit reflects that the United States consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. The U.S. trade deficit is driven by the consumption exceeding production and imports surpassing exports. Economists attribute this deficit to a lack of domestic savings, leading to borrowing from countries with excess savings like China. This borrowing fuels economic growth, boosting consumption and demand for imports, resulting in a trade deficit. Other factors like economic growth disparities between countries and the role of the U.S. dollar also impact the trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by the availability of dollar-denominated assets and foreign investments in U.S. Treasury securities. The deficit relative to GDP has decreased from 5.8% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2017, aligning with historical trends. Countries with savings below investment needs, like the United States, become net borrowers. The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, had the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP in 2017. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest current account surpluses. Some policymakers believe that U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China are due to unfair trade practices, but overall trade deficits are mainly influenced by low U.S. savings rather than trade barriers. The evidence suggests that high tariffs and trade barriers are not correlated with smaller overall trade deficits. If protectionist trade measures were reduced in certain countries, U.S. exporters might sell more products. However, if U.S. overall consumption and savings behavior did not change, increased demand for imports would leave the overall U.S. trade deficit relatively unchanged. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, including economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Trade deficits with certain partners often reflect complex supply chain relationships. Deficits with trading partners often reflect complex supply chain relationships, where one country serves as the final point of assembly or a supplier of inputs. Trade deficits can impact a country's exchange rate, causing a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad. The excess supply of dollars can lower its value relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. However, the dollar's special status in global financial markets as a reserve currency complicates this adjustment process. The U.S. economy is seen as a safe haven for wealth storage and investments, particularly for countries like China with high savings rates. Foreign countries buying U.S. Treasury securities can lead to a stronger dollar, making U.S. exports pricier. Some analysts argue that interventions by countries like China to keep their currency undervalued hinder global trade balance realignment. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment gap, with the U.S. borrowing from abroad. Concerns arise from accumulating debt due to sustained trade deficits, with the impact depending on whether borrowed funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing to finance investments in productive capital can lead to higher economic growth in the long run, while borrowing for consumer purchases may burden future generations. A rising U.S. trade deficit could potentially cause a sharp decline in the value of the dollar, risking financial instability. Addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances is crucial to prevent negative impacts on economic growth. Addressing the U.S. trade deficit without tackling macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy by reducing growth. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include increasing domestic savings or decreasing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates and preventing currency manipulation by other countries are also options. Trade policies are not the most effective tools for balancing trade. In 2017, the U.S. had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for a significant portion of exports and imports. The U.S. trade deficit could harm the economy without addressing macroeconomic imbalances. Ways to reduce the deficit include increasing domestic savings or realigning exchange rates. The manufacturing sector has seen changes due to global value chains, with some labor-intensive activities moving abroad. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have raised concerns about the sector's health, despite mixed data on output and employment trends. The United States has experienced a decline in manufacturing employment but an increase in output due to higher productivity. Despite its decreasing share of the economy, manufacturing remains significant. From 1980 to 2017, real output increased by over 80%, with a 20% increase since 2009. However, manufacturing's contribution to GDP has decreased, while services have increased. Employment in manufacturing has decreased since 1979 but has been rising since 2010, accounting for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017. Employment in manufacturing has declined in the United States, accounting for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017 compared to 20.7% in 1980. The services sector has expanded by 20 percentage points over the same period. Changes in the manufacturing sector are not unique to the US and have occurred in other advanced economies. Factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and trade have influenced these changes. Some attribute the decline in manufacturing jobs to increased imports from China, while others believe automation and other factors play a larger role. The US manufacturing sector has been undergoing a fundamental restructuring for over two decades. The U.S. manufacturing sector has been undergoing a fundamental restructuring for over two decades. Despite a decline in the U.S. share of global manufacturing value-added, the country remains a top global manufacturer. In 2017, the U.S. exported $138 billion in agricultural goods and imported $121 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $17 billion. Agriculture accounted for 6% of total U.S. exports and 4% of total U.S. imports. Trade remains a significant component of the U.S. economy. The U.S. agricultural sector relies on foreign markets for a significant portion of its output, with exports making up about 20% of total farm production value. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices play a large role in U.S. food consumption. Additionally, services like transportation, telecommunications, and financial services are crucial for the economy, facilitating the movement of goods and providing credits for manufacturing. In 2017, the United States exported $798 billion in services, with telecommunications services opening e-commerce channels and financial services providing credits for goods manufacturing. Trade barriers for services often involve discriminatory regulations favoring domestic providers and restrictions on establishing a commercial presence in importing countries. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports accounting for 34% of total exports and imports accounting for 19%. Services trade plays a significant role in the U.S. economy, contributing to 79% of GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. Surpluses in services trade have helped offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the lack of value-added measurement, with services inputs like transportation, R&D, and business services being crucial in the value chain. The value chain in trade includes transportation, R&D, design, engineering, and business services. These services can be captured in trade in value-added statistics. Digital trade encompasses various activities like online shopping, information transmission, online health and educational services, communication channels, and financial services. ICT services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Digital trade constraints can be tariff or nontariff barriers affecting market offerings and operations. Trade constraints can be classified as tariff or nontariff barriers, with nontariff barriers often taking the form of localization requirements that restrict cross-border data flows. These barriers can limit the type of services a firm can offer or how it can communicate and share data internationally. Data localization regulations may also hinder the entry of cloud-computing providers into a market. The United States played a significant role in shaping the global economic order post-World War II, establishing multilateral institutions to promote economic advancement. The United States has historically played a key role in shaping the global economic order post-World War II, focusing on trade policies that support economic growth, job creation, and liberalizing markets. U.S. trade policy objectives also include advancing strategic goals by supporting economic development in developing countries, strengthening regional alliances, and extending U.S. influence abroad. The current Administration aims to pursue trade policies that support national security, negotiate new trade deals, enforce trade laws, and protect U.S. rights under trade agreements. The U.S. trade policy focuses on supporting national security, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and protecting U.S. rights under agreements. The USTR and various U.S. agencies are involved in implementing trade policy through interagency coordination. Congress plays a significant role in trade policy through legislative and oversight authority. The U.S. trade policy is implemented through interagency coordination, with agencies like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture playing key roles. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy, enacting laws on tariffs, trade remedies, and trade agreements based on statutory authorities. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy, enacting laws on tariffs, trade remedies, and trade agreements based on statutory authorities. This includes setting trade negotiating objectives, requiring consultation from the executive branch, and conducting oversight hearings on trade programs and agreements. The President has delegated powers to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action regarding trade policy. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded the executive branch's authority to open markets and negotiate international trade norms. Congressional committees like the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance have primary responsibility for trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees, like the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking, also play a role in trade policy, including oversight of foreign relations and export controls. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to the USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements negotiated by the President. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) advise USTR during trade agreement negotiations, with separate groups for the House and Senate. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, committee membership, testimony, letters to USTR, and informal influence over other Members. Congress is responsible for implementing trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law through legislation. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements negotiated by the President. TPA ensures expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. It defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President negotiating credibility. TPA must be in effect for a trade agreement to be eligible for expedited consideration, reflecting negotiating objectives specified in the statute. Congress first enacted TPA in 1974 and has renewed it four times, evolving aspects of the authority. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements negotiated by the President. TPA ensures expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. The most recent TPA legislation was signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26) and applies to concluded trade agreements notified to Congress before July 1, 2021. The executive branch executes trade policy, negotiates treaties, implements and monitors trade agreements, and is responsible for customs enforcement, collection of duties, trade remedy laws, budget proposals, and export/import policies. The President directs overall trade policy and the USTR serves as the chief adviser on trade policy. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance in U.S. trade policy and negotiations. Trade functions are delegated to various departments and agencies within the executive branch, which coordinate U.S. positions through an interagency process. Other key agencies with trade responsibilities include the... The USTR is responsible for developing and implementing trade policy, negotiating agreements, and enforcing trade laws. Key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, and Treasury, with input from advisory groups. The USTR leads trade negotiations, but decisions often involve other departments, requiring a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, with sub-Cabinet groups like the TPRG and TPSC to assist in the process. Advice is also solicited from a three-tier trade advisory committee system mandated by Congress. The executive branch solicits advice from a three-tier trade advisory committee system mandated by Congress, consisting of private sector and nonfederal government representatives. The President influences trade legislation, signs it into law, and makes specific decisions on U.S. trade policies when necessary. The private sector and stakeholders play a role in U.S. trade policy formulation through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in 1974. The advisory system established by Congress in 1974 consists of 28 committees with about 700 citizen advisors, overseen by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. It includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, five general policy advisory committees, and 20 technical advisory committees. These committees ensure that U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs, providing information and advice on negotiating objectives and bargaining positions for trade agreements. Private sector, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders also influence U.S. trade policy through various channels. Representatives from industry, NGOs, and the private sector testify before congressional committees and government bodies on trade negotiations. Stakeholders provide input through Federal Register notices on trade initiatives. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups lobby Congress and the executive branch on trade policies. Trade impacts various sectors of the U.S. economy, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services due to technological advancements. The implementation of trade policy in the United States can have a significant impact on various industries, firms, and workers, influencing employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Stakeholders, including businesses, farmers, workers, and public interest groups, strive to ensure their views are represented in trade policy decisions. Legal challenges may be brought in federal court by importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties regarding governmental actions and decisions related to trade, such as customs classification and antidumping determinations. Legal challenges in federal court can be brought by importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties regarding governmental actions and decisions concerning trade. Cases may involve customs classification, antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review, and court decisions can impact U.S. trade policy. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President and decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions and import embargoes. Decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States negotiates trade agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce barriers, increase market access for exporters, gain competitive advantages, and strengthen alliances. The United States participates in various trade agreements to reduce barriers, increase market access, and strengthen alliances. These agreements include multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements (FTAs) with different numbers of participants, and plurilateral agreements focusing on specific sectors. The US currently has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, while globally, nearly 300 trade agreements are in force. The United States has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries. Nearly 300 trade agreements are in force globally. U.S. FTAs mainly involve small, developing countries, with only 35% of total U.S. trade with FTA partners. President Trump's trade policy includes withdrawing from the TPP, renegotiating FTAs, and proposing new negotiations. The USMCA, a renegotiated NAFTA agreement, was signed on November 30, 2018. The U.S. renegotiated the USMCA and KORUS agreements under TPA procedures. Amendments to KORUS, including the delayed reduction of light truck tariffs, took effect in 2019. USTR notified Congress of intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the EU, and the UK in 2018. U.S. FTAs are more comprehensive than those of other countries, covering tariff reductions and enforceable commitments beyond WTO rules. U.S. FTAs go beyond WTO rules, including tariff elimination, services trade barriers reduction, foreign investment rules, intellectual property protection, and enforceable labor and environmental standards. TIFAs are nonbinding agreements for consultation on economic interests to promote trade and investment, with over 50 agreements mostly with developing countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 as part of the post-WWII effort to build a stable international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995. The GATT aimed to lower tariffs and promote nondiscriminatory trade practices, leading to a significant reduction in trade barriers. The WTO, established in 1995, administers trade rules and agreements to reduce tariffs and trade barriers. It oversees negotiations, dispute resolution, and agreements like GATT, GATS, and TRIPS. The US played a key role in its establishment and the Uruguay Round negotiations. The WTO oversees negotiations among its members, including the Doha Development Agenda which has been stalled since 2015. The latest Ministerial Conference in 2017 did not produce major results, with ongoing talks in fisheries subsidies and e-commerce. The organization's effectiveness in trade liberalization and dispute resolution has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Members believe reforms are needed for the WTO to maintain its role in global trade. The WTO is facing challenges in resolving trade disputes and maintaining its role in the global trading system since the collapse of the Doha Round. Proposed reforms aim to improve the dispute settlement system, but the Trump Administration's withholding of appointments to the WTO Appellate Body could lead to the system's dysfunction by late 2019. Dispute settlement proceedings can be initiated by a WTO member to challenge trade practices that violate WTO agreements, starting with consultations and potentially leading to adjudication by a dispute panel and appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, they are expected to remove the challenged measure. The WTO dispute settlement system allows for appeals to the WTO Appellate Body if a panel decision is challenged. If a member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, they must remove the measure within a compliance period. The prevailing member can request temporary retaliatory action or seek compensation. The United States has been active in WTO disputes, with pending challenges to recent tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly affect U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation. Compliance actions are decided by USTR for successful challenges to U.S. statutes, policies, or practices. U.S. legislative action involves USTR deciding on compliance actions for successful challenges. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions. U.S. FTAs have procedures for resolving disputes, similar to WTO processes. Compliance with panel decisions is expected, with possible trade benefit suspension for non-compliance. Disputes common to both FTA and WTO rules are addressed accordingly. The United States complies with WTO decisions and has procedures for resolving disputes in FTAs. Non-compliance can lead to trade benefit suspension. Disputes common to both FTA and WTO rules are addressed accordingly. U.S. FTAs have a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions, including investor-state dispute settlement. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. The United States offers nonreciprocal, duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries through various trade preference programs. These programs include the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA), Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE). GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, such as protecting intellectual property and worker rights. The USTR is currently reviewing the eligibility of several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade. The U.S. invested $1.2 billion in TCB activities in FY2016 across 134 countries. TCB helps countries negotiate trade agreements, implement reforms, and meet export standards. Currently, no single agency coordinates U.S. government TCB efforts. USAID and MCC receive significant funding for TCB activities. The U.S. government agencies involved in trade capacity building (TCB) include USAID, MCC, Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects tariffs at ports of entry, generating $32 billion in revenue in 2016. The U.S. has used tariff policy to promote global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through trade agreements. The United States has reduced tariffs through trade agreements to promote global trade liberalization. By 2016, U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. U.S. trade laws include remedies to address unfair trade practices. The United States has trade laws to address unfair practices, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws administered by the Department of Commerce. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, and patent infringements. All laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations. The United States has trade laws to address unfair practices, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws administered by the Department of Commerce. Antidumping (AD) is the most frequently used U.S. trade remedy law, aimed at preventing unfair trade practices where foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the United States. Support for trade remedies comes from those who believe they are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers, while others fear they may lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the world trading system. The United States utilizes antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws to address unfair trade practices, with AD orders issued when foreign goods are sold below fair value and CVD orders imposed to offset competitive advantages from subsidies. As of mid-December 2018, there were 354 AD orders in place, with over one-third against China, and 113 CVD orders, nearly half of which were also against China. These trade remedy laws aim to protect U.S. industries and workers from unfair trade practices. The United States utilizes antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws to address unfair trade practices, with AD orders issued when foreign goods are sold below fair value and CVD orders imposed to offset competitive advantages from subsidies. In mid-December 2018, there were 113 CVD orders in place, nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry without requiring allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC conducts investigations initiated by petitions and makes recommendations to the President for temporary relief. Two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration in 2017, leading to a four-year safeguard measure on imports of solar cells in January 2018. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. The President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose restrictions on imports threatening national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies to conduct investigations. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures on imports that threaten national security. In February 2018, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports after Commerce investigations. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 addresses unfair trade barriers, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. Currently, investigations are ongoing for uranium imports and autos/auto parts. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 addresses unfair trade barriers, specifically focusing on inadequate protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). Cases can be initiated by petition or self-initiated by USTR, with a focus on negotiating settlements with trading partners. If no resolution is reached, tariffs may be imposed on selected products. Additionally, \"Special 301\" requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR regimes. Since 1974, USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases, retaliating in 16 instances, with almost half occurring in the 1980s. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation into China's IPR technology policies, finding them harmful to U.S. economic interests in March 2018. This led to increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China by the Trump Administration, with threats of more. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. products and both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not changed its unfair practices prompting the Section 301 investigation. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to immediately begin negotiations on \"structural changes\" in regards to IP and technology issues related to the Section 301 case, along with agriculture and services, with the goal of achieving an agreement in 90 days. China reportedly agreed to make \"very substantial\" purchases of U.S. agricultural, energy, and industrial products. The United States agreed to suspend the Section 301 tariff increases from 10% to 25% that were planned to take effect on January 1, 2019, contingent on an agreement in 90 days. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair acts or unfair methods of competition in importing goods or selling imports in the United States, increasingly used for IPR enforcement. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits imports infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor products. The ITC handles investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal aid to workers affected by trade, with TAA for Workers being the largest program with $790 million in FY2019. Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAAW) is a significant program with $790 million in appropriations in FY2019. It helps workers impacted by foreign competition through job loss or relocation. Administered by the Department of Labor, TAAW offers various benefits like career services, training, and income support. The program aims to mitigate the challenges faced by workers and firms due to trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is justified for economic efficiency, equity, and support for international trade. Critics argue it is costly and may not be equitable. Despite disagreements, Congress has maintained the program for five decades. Several federal agencies promote U.S. exports and support investment, including the Export-Import Bank and the Department of Agriculture. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new successor agency for OPIC. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field against foreign firms with subsidized financing. The International Trade Administration supports U.S. exports, especially for small and medium-sized companies. The Ex-Im Bank provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit. The Ex-Im Bank, the official U.S. export credit agency, provides support services to small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) through export counseling, direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance. Despite its reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank has been constrained in approving medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million due to unfilled positions on its board of directors. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over the role of government in financing exports. The United States restricts exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various laws like the Arms Export Control Act, Export Controls Act of 2018, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Export controls are used to limit trade with sanctioned countries and require licenses from Departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Treasury. The Export Controls Act of 2018 grants the President authority to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Controls Act of 2018, enacted on August 13, 2018, grants broad legislative authority to the President for implementing dual-use export controls. It replaced the Export Administration Act of 1979 and allows the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial for national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications and are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Global capital flows consist of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). FDI involves acquiring real assets like real estate or manufacturing plants, while FPI involves buying foreign equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while FPI is highly liquid. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. From 1990 to 2017, global trade in goods and services grew significantly, while gross capital flows expanded from $1 trillion to about $4 trillion annually. Capital flows, including direct, portfolio, and other official investments, increased from $1 trillion to $4 trillion annually, peaking at over $12 trillion in 2007. Foreign exchange and derivatives markets also saw significant growth. These markets impact the international exchange value of the dollar, influencing prices and securities costs. Multinational corporations invest abroad to boost profits, leveraging special knowledge or managerial skills. Leading central banks reported daily foreign currency trading exceeding $5.1 trillion in 2016. Multinational corporations invest abroad to leverage special knowledge or skills, gain competitive advantages, access resources like low-cost labor, and improve efficiency or market share. Foreign markets also provide access to diverse resources, such as a well-educated workforce, contributing to R&D activities. Some FDI transactions involve mergers and acquisitions to enhance global competitiveness. According to UNCTAD, global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the US as the largest source and recipient. Developing Asia received the largest share of FDI inflows, followed by Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. US FDI abroad increased from $238 billion to $6.0 trillion from 1985 to 2017, while FDI in the US rose from $184 billion to $4.0 trillion. From 1985 to 2017, U.S. FDI abroad increased to $6.0 trillion, with major destinations including the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Luxembourg. FDI in the United States rose to $4.0 trillion, with top sources being the United Kingdom and Japan. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services, while inward FDI is mainly in the manufacturing sector. Economists support international capital flows like FDI for mutual economic benefits. Direct investment, both inward and outward, has significant benefits for both the home and host countries. It allows firms to exploit competitive advantages, acquire skills, and strengthen their competitive position. Host countries benefit from added capital stock, technological advances, and a more competitive business environment. Overall, FDI contributes to international trade, global economic integration, and plays a role in U.S. trade, jobs, and production. In 2016, foreign firms in the U.S. employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported. Outward FDI in the U.S. plays a significant role in trade, jobs, and production. Foreign firm affiliates employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods in 2016. They contributed $894.0 billion value-added to U.S. GDP, with higher growth compared to other U.S. firms. Concerns exist about U.S. firms investing abroad leading to job losses domestically, but data on this is mostly anecdotal. Most U.S. outward FDI is in high-income developed countries, where production is consumed locally. There is no conclusive evidence that U.S. direct investment abroad results in fewer jobs or lower wages. Most economists argue that U.S. outward foreign direct investment (FDI) does not necessarily lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. The loss of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. is attributed to sector restructuring and domestic economic forces. International investment agreements (IIAs) play a key role in establishing rules for investment protections, with over 2,600 IIAs in force globally. These agreements aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure fair treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. International investment agreements (IIAs) establish rules for investment protections, ensuring fair treatment of investors and safeguarding a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs, such as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs), involve reciprocal commitments with foreign investors. The U.S. has BITs with 40 countries, including developing nations, and FTAs covering 20 countries, most with investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions in international investment agreements enable private investors to bring claims against host country governments for alleged violations of investment agreements before an international arbitration panel. ISDS cases have increased with the growth of global foreign direct investment (FDI). U.S. investors account for about one-fifth of investment claims worldwide, with the U.S. government not having lost a case yet. ISDS provisions are included in the majority of U.S. bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and free trade agreements (FTAs), with most cases brought against the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The use of ISDS has become a subject of debate recently. The use of ISDS in U.S. trade negotiations has sparked debate, focusing on investor protections and government regulatory rights. The Trump Administration made significant changes to ISDS in the NAFTA renegotiation, proposing to eliminate it between the U.S. and Canada and impose limits with Mexico. ISDS was also contentious in T-TIP talks during the Obama Administration. The EU aims to replace ISDS with an investment court system in recent trade agreements. Concerns about foreign investment, especially from government-owned firms, raise national security issues overseen by CFIUS. CFIUS, an interagency committee overseeing foreign investment transactions for U.S. national security, was established in 1975 and gained formal review authority in 1988. In 2007, its role was expanded to include \"homeland security\" and \"critical industries.\" The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, which conducts risk-based analyses of foreign investments. The President can block transactions, which has occurred five times since 1988. CFIUS has the authority to block transactions, which has been invoked five times since 1988. Recent examples include President Trump blocking acquisitions by Chinese and Singapore-based firms. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands CFIUS's scope to review non-controlling investments in critical technology or infrastructure. Some criticize this expansion as contrary to the U.S.'s open investment climate. OPIC provides services to facilitate U.S. investments abroad. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 establishes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) as a successor to OPIC, providing political risk insurance and financing to support U.S. private investments in developing countries and emerging markets. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, promotes foreign direct investment in the United States by providing information to businesses and advocating for investments in the U.S. over foreign locations."
