    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". The growth in international trade, particularly containerized trade, is increasing pressure on the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. From 2000 to 2005, international trade value rose from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with containerized trade shipments increasing from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Existing and potential trade agreements indicate a further rise in international trade and freight congestion. The US is a member of the World Trade Organization, has 11 free trade agreements, and is negotiating with 4 countries and multi-lateral organizations for more agreements. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to Americans wasting billions of hours in traffic and spending billions on extra fuel annually. Over 200 freight bottlenecks are causing economic losses and delays, requiring significant investments to maintain and improve transportation systems for economic productivity. To enhance the Nation's economic productivity, governments must invest billions in transportation systems. The Act aims to address investment needs in trade corridors, reduce congestion, and improve freight transportation reliability for citizens' quality of life. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles in the United States, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee will be collected for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. The fee established for imported articles into the United States will be deposited in a designated account and will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, a national trade gateway corridor fee will be established for exported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee for carrying out eligible projects in transportation trade corridors will be assessed and collected by the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with other relevant departments. The fee collected will be deposited in a separate account established in the Treasury. This fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. The National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund was established in 2017 in the Treasury for fees collected under this section. The fund will be used by the Secretary of Transportation for expenditures related to the obligations of the United States until October 1, 2018.

The Secretary of Transportation will set aside 2 percent of the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for administrative expenses related to collecting fees on imports and exports. After this set-aside, the remaining funds will be apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on the fees collected for each Customs port of entry. The Secretary of Transportation will allocate funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on fees collected at Customs ports of entry. If a corridor spans multiple states, the funds will be divided among the states based on lane miles and vehicle miles traveled in each state. The Secretary of Transportation allocates funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors. Funds are divided among states based on vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways in the corridor. Amounts granted for projects remain available for 6 years, with unobligated funds after this period allocated to other states for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors.

Unobligated funds after 6 years are allocated to other States for eligible projects. SEC. 5. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with various stakeholders, adhering to planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and rating proposed projects. The State department of transportation must develop a process for rating proposed projects for grants under the Act, clearly identifying the basis for project ratings. The State department of transportation must develop a process for rating proposed projects for grants under the Act, clearly identifying the basis for project ratings. SEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to a State department of transportation for projects in transportation trade corridors. Projects must meet construction standards for highways on the Federal-aid system. The Federal share of project costs is 80%, and the non-Federal share cannot come from other Federal funds.

The prevailing rate of wage for eligible projects under this section must comply with Section 113 of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and locations. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states, extend up to 300 miles from the port of entry, and only include areas used for international trade-related movements. Additionally, a single corridor may be established for multiple ports of entry located close to each other, with a deadline of 180 days for proposed corridor establishment. The Secretary of Transportation must establish proposed transportation trade corridors within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A 45-day comment period will follow for public input and hearings. Final corridors must be established within one year. Periodic reviews and modifications may occur annually before the fiscal year ends. The Secretary of Transportation may conduct reviews and hearings to ensure transportation trade corridors are established for Customs ports of entry with collected fees, and that the corridor boundaries align with the objectives of the Act.
