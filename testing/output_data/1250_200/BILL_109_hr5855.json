    "content": "SECTION 1. MASTER TEACHER EXCLUSION. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section regarding certain wages of certified master teachers. The Internal Revenue Code now includes a new section that excludes 25 percent of wages earned by certified master teachers at qualified schools in need of improvement or Head Start programs. A certified master teacher is defined as an eligible teacher certified by a State for a 4-year period, with limitations on recertification and the number of certified master teachers per State. The certification of master teachers in qualified schools in need of improvement would result in more than 10 percent of the State's public school teachers being certified master teachers. The term 'qualified school in need of improvement' is defined as a school that employs a certified master teacher during the certification period, and any subsequent school that employs the teacher after previous schools have improved. The term 'school in need of improvement' refers to a public elementary or secondary school identified for improvement under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. An 'eligible teacher' must have 5 years of teaching experience, be highly qualified, hold a master's degree, and have advanced certification in the state licensing system. The section discusses the qualifications required for a certified master teacher, including holding a master's degree and obtaining advanced certification in the state licensing system or from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The certification period is defined as a 4-year period, and the teacher must include their certified state on their tax return. This section does not apply after December 31, 2013. The table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after section 139A, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2013. The Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress annually from 2007 to 2013 on the number of certified master teachers in each State who received income exclusions under section 139B of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
