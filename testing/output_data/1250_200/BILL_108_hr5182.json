It amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include provisions for protecting civil rights and liberties. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to ensure the protection of civil rights and civil liberties in Department programs and activities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to incorporate oversight of compliance with civil rights and civil liberties in Department programs. This includes coordinating with other officials to address these considerations comprehensively and investigating complaints of possible abuses, unless referred to the Inspector General. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include protection of civil rights and civil liberties by the Office of Inspector General, designated to oversee compliance and investigate complaints of possible abuses. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security designates a senior official to coordinate investigations of abuses of civil rights and civil liberties, receive complaints, and initiate investigations of alleged abuses by employees or officials of the Department or independent contractors. The Department of Homeland Security ensures personnel in the Office of Inspector General receive training for civil rights and civil liberties investigations. They consult with the Officer for Civil Rights and Liberties on alleged abuses and policy recommendations. The Officer is provided with investigation outcomes, and matters not investigated are referred to them. The Office of Inspector General also collaborates with the Officer for Civil Rights and Liberties. The  Inspector General does not investigate the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The Office of Inspector General must publicize information on filing complaints and the status of investigations. They must also report weaknesses in civil rights and civil liberties within the Department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include a Privacy Officer who reports directly to the Secretary. The Privacy Officer coordinates with the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to ensure integrated and comprehensive handling of programs, policies, and procedures related to civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. The Congress receives appropriate reports on these matters."
