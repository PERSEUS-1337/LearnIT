    "content": "Modern deep neural networks have a large amount of weights, making them challenging to deploy on mobile devices. To address this issue, a mixture of multiple low-rank factorizations is proposed to model weight matrices dynamically. This approach improves computation efficiency while maintaining or even outperforming accuracy compared to full-rank counterparts. Model compression techniques, such as low-rank factorization, are proposed to reduce the size of weight matrices in deep neural networks. However, a small rank in the factorization can limit model expressiveness and lead to worse performance. To address this dilemma, increasing the expressiveness by learning an adaptive, input-dependent approach is suggested. To address limitations in model expressiveness, a proposed approach involves learning an adaptive factorization using a mixture of low-rank factorizations with mixing weights computed based on the input. This adaptive linear projection improves performance at a small additional cost. The input is denoted as h and the number of mixture components as K, decomposing a weight matrix using a function \u03c0 to map inputs to mixture coefficients. This method introduces extra flexibility compared to conventional low-rank factorization techniques. The proposed method involves using a mixture of low-rank factorizations with adaptive mixing weights to improve model expressiveness. The function \u03c0 maps inputs to mixture coefficients, allowing for flexibility in generating mixing weights. This approach adds extra parameters and computation but enhances the projected low-dimensional space. The proposed method suggests using adaptive mixing weights to improve model expressiveness by reducing parameters and computation in the mixing weights \u03c0. Strategies include pooling before projection and using random projection with a random matrix P random. The proposed method introduces adaptive mixing weights to enhance model expressiveness by reducing parameters and computation. It involves assigning weights into groups and dynamically controlling them at the group level. Recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTM models, are utilized for language modeling using Penn Tree Bank and Text8 datasets. The study introduces adaptive mixing weights to improve model expressiveness in LSTM language modeling using PTB and Text8 datasets. Three variants of the model are tested, showing a 40% reduction in FLOPs and a decrease in perplexity by 1.7 points compared to regular low-rank factorization. Adaptive mixtures outperform non-adaptive methods, with pooling before projection being a beneficial choice. The use of adaptive mixtures improves performance compared to regular low-rank factorization. Pooling before projection reduces computation and parameter size while capturing global information for better accuracy in compressing CNN models. The proposed method achieves significantly better results with negligible extra FLOPs compared to regular low-rank factorization of MobileNet model."
