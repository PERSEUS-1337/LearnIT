    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 with findings and purposes. The Congress finds the importance of maintaining federal expertise in hydrographic data and services to support a safe marine transportation system. The Congress recognizes the critical role of hydrographic data and services in ensuring a safe and efficient marine transportation system for international trade, interstate commerce, and various other activities. The increasing congestion in the nation's marine transportation system, expected growth in international maritime commerce, and the significance of hydrographic data for emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency are highlighted. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, with a focus on ocean and coastal mapping, observations, and hazard mitigation. NOAA's expertise in hydrography is essential for defining marine and coastal territorial limits, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's role includes establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, supporting safe international trade, interstate commerce, homeland security, emergency response, and marine management. This Act aims to enhance NOAA's capabilities, provide accurate hydrographic data, and promote the use of new technologies for efficiency and safety. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to support homeland security, emergency response, marine management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services with various applications. This includes promoting integrated ocean and coastal mapping, research and development in hydrographic data and technologies, and providing national and international leadership. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to support homeland security, emergency response, marine management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services to promote the Nation's scientific and technological competitiveness and provide national and international leadership for hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892) is amended to define hydrographic data and outline the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of information for providing hydrographic services. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, defined as the Act approved on August 6, 1947, pertains to products derived from hydrographic data. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Administrator may procure, operate vessels and equipment for safe navigation, maintain hydrographic monitoring systems, acquire data for conservation, and support life and property protection. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in response to emergencies and homeland security needs. Changes were made to the quality assurance program and the hydrographic services review panel under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Amendments were made to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, including changes to the composition of the panel and the qualifications of its members. Amendments to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 include changes to the panel's composition and member qualifications. Voting members will now be reimbursed for expenses incurred while performing their duties.
