    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects 1,500,000 people in the US. It is a blood vessel disease with lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Detection is costly, and symptoms include neurological deficits, seizures, and stroke. Limited research means surgery is the only treatment option. Some patients are not eligible for surgery and have no other treatment available. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, highlights the critical need for increased research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The Senate emphasizes the need for increased research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence to translate scientific discoveries into clinical applications. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma and enhance medical care nationwide. A centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico to enhance medical care nationwide for individuals with cavernous angioma. A Cavernous Angioma Care Center is to be established at the University of New Mexico under the Public Health Service Act to enhance medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will include researchers, clinicians, and medical staff specializing in various areas such as headache, epilepsy, psychiatry, and dermatology. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will include specialists such as an epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, vascular fellow, postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The center must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school and maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center at the University of New Mexico offers education and training in diagnosis and treatment, research training for postdoctoral fellows, recruitment of new researchers and clinicians, continuing medical education for clinicians, and patient advocacy programs including public awareness campaigns and education for school nurses. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center at the University of New Mexico aims to improve early detection and diagnosis through school nurse training, patient and family conferences, and electronic health tools. They also collaborate with research institutions, facilitate clinical trials, and have an advisory board for guidance. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico is led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research. The Director ensures high-quality medical and surgical care, promotes community-centered care, and coordinates opportunities for clinical research studies. The Center includes representatives from patient advocacy groups, physicians, scientists, and affiliated institutions. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico, led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research, promotes community-centered care, coordinates clinical research studies, and serves as a model and training facility for similar facilities in the United States. The advisory board is required to submit biannual reports to the Secretary on the Center's activities, including progress made in implementing requirements and expenditures.
