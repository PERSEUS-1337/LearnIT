    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Positive Behavior for Safe and Effective Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The findings highlight the ineffectiveness of harsh school discipline policies, such as suspension and expulsion, which disproportionately affect students of color and those with disabilities. Research shows that these approaches do not deter misbehavior and can lead to higher rates of future misconduct. Students of color and students with disabilities face higher suspension and expulsion rates compared to their peers. School discipline is strongly linked to the student dropout rate, with suspended students more likely to drop out, engage in delinquent behavior, and enter the criminal justice system. Teachers also leave the profession due to school discipline issues. Successful schools have high academic and behavior standards, leading to improved academic outcomes. Implementing evidence-based practices can enhance behavior and create a positive school climate. Effective implementation of school-wide positive behavior supports is correlated with improved academic outcomes. Evidence-based practices such as school-wide positive behavior supports can lead to greater academic achievement, fewer disciplinary problems, lower suspension rates, and increased instructional time. Early intervening services have been shown to decrease out-of-school suspensions significantly, resulting in improved student proficiency on State standards. Many problems can be prevented or minimized with early intervention strategies. Implementing school-wide positive behavior supports has shown to decrease disciplinary issues, improve academic outcomes, and create safer teaching environments. Early intervening services have been effective in reducing the need for intensive interventions and preventing problems. For example, a Maryland elementary school saw a 42% decrease in office discipline referrals and regained instructional time by implementing such supports. In South Carolina, a school using positive behavior supports had a 100% decrease in teacher transfer requests and a 36% decrease in teacher absence days. These approaches benefit all students, including those with challenging behaviors. The Act aims to expand the use of school-wide positive behavior supports to create a conducive learning environment, reduce discipline referrals, and improve student academic outcomes. The Act defines positive behavior supports as a systematic approach to reinforce desired behaviors and prevent problem behaviors in all students, including those with complex needs. It also emphasizes the implementation of school-wide positive behavior supports to enhance learning outcomes and reduce disciplinary issues. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility to use Title I funds for school-wide positive behavior supports, including early intervening services for all students needing academic and behavioral support in a general education setting.

The Act also emphasizes the importance of reviewing discipline referrals, school climate, and family engagement to assist schools in creating a positive learning environment.

Federal assistance is provided to States for grants to local educational agencies. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act aims to enhance student academic achievement by providing Federal assistance to States for grants to local educational agencies and consortia to improve school-wide climate, including implementing positive behavior supports. SEC. 7 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to address the need for early intervening services to improve school climate and reduce disciplinary actions. SEC. 8 focuses on specialized instructional support services. The Secretary of Education oversees programs for specialized instructional support services in schools to improve academic achievement. This includes identifying effective practices, providing training for personnel, and offering technical assistance to schools. The Secretary of Education oversees programs for specialized instructional support services in schools to improve academic achievement by providing technical assistance, coordinating programs, and evaluating effectiveness. Specialized instructional support personnel include school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other qualified professionals providing necessary services. Specialized instructional support services, including related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, are provided as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. This includes services from specialized instructional support personnel to address student needs. SEC. 9. DEFINITION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965.
