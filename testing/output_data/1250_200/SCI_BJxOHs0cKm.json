    "content": "While empirical evidence suggests that model generalization is related to local properties of the optima described via the Hessian, the PAC-Bayes paradigm connects model generalization with the local solution's properties. The generalization ability is linked to the Hessian, Lipschitz constant, and parameter scales. A metric is proposed to score generalization capability and an algorithm to optimize the model accordingly. Deep models excel in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing despite having more parameters than training samples. Classical learning theory suggests generalization capability is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space. The generalization capability of a model is related to the spectrum of the Hessian matrix evaluated at the solution. Large eigenvalues of the Hessian often lead to poor model generalization. Different metrics measure the \"sharpness\" of the solution, showing a connection between sharpness and generalization. However, Hessian-based sharpness measures may not directly explain generalization due to re-parameterization affecting parameter geometry. The geometry of parameters in RELU-MLP can be drastically modified by re-parameterization. Bayesian analysis uses Taylor expansion to approximate the posterior, with the Hessian of the loss function evaluating model simplicity. BID34 penalizes sharp minima and determines optimal batch size. PAC-Bayes bound is used to analyze generalization behavior of deep models, connecting to Occam's razor. Sharp minimums have complex structures in predicted labels, while flat minimums produce simpler results. The paper explores the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution from a PAC-Bayes perspective. It introduces a new metric for generalization based on the Hessian of the loss function, the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, parameter scales, and training sample size. This analysis allows for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to improve generalization, which is related to the Hessian. The paper introduces a new metric for generalization based on the Hessian of the loss function, allowing for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to improve model generalization. It proposes a perturbation-based algorithm that utilizes the estimation of the Hessian to enhance generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes scenario. The paper discusses a perturbation-based algorithm that uses the Hessian of the loss function to improve model generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes scenario. It connects generalization with local properties around the solution through perturbations, emphasizing the need to find an optimal perturbation level for minimizing the bound. In this section, the paper introduces the local smoothness assumption and a main theorem regarding the connection between the Hessian matrix and model generalization. It focuses on defining a neighborhood set around a reference point and discusses the Hessian Lipschitz property for the empirical loss function. The Hessian Lipschitz condition is used in numeric optimization to model second-order gradient smoothness. Theorem 2 shows that with carefully chosen perturbation levels, the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model can be controlled. The bound is related to the Hessian diagonal elements, Lipschitz constant, neighborhood scales, number of parameters, and samples. Perturbation level is inversely related to the Hessian diagonal elements. The perturbation level is inversely related to the Hessian diagonal elements, and the model parameters' \"posterior\" distribution is uniform. The perturbed parameters are bounded, and the distribution supports vary for different parameters. The perturbed parameters are bounded by |w i | + \u03ba i (w) \u2264 \u03c4 i \u2200i. The proof procedure involves solving for \u03c3 that minimizes the right hand side, leading to Theorem 2. The experiment treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter, and one may optimize for the best \u03b7 BID33. The proof details for Theorem 2 are in Appendix C and D.5. Re-parameterization of RELU-MLP shows that scaling the Hessian spectrum does not affect generalization. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, changing the bound logarithmically. Lemma (3) shows that optimal \u03c3* keeps key factors behind a logarithmic function. The optimal perturbation levels in RELU-MLP scale inversely with parameters, affecting generalization with a logarithmic factor. The bound, as shown in Lemma (3), keeps key factors behind a logarithmic function. An approximate generalization metric, pacGen, is introduced based on PAC-Bayes theory, considering local convexity and Hessian estimation for real-world data. The Hessian and Lipschitz constant are estimated for efficiency following Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The neighborhood radius is set to \u03b3 = 0.1 and = 0.1 for all experiments. Training with varying batch sizes shows a growing gap between test and training loss. Similarly, adjusting the learning rate affects the generalization gap and metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) over epochs. The generalization gap increases as the learning rate decreases, with the proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) showing a similar trend. Adding noise to the model has been successful for better generalization. Optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] instead of just minimizing the empirical lossL(w) improves model generalization power. A systematic way to perturb model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound is introduced, using exponential smoothing technique to estimate the Hessian \u2207. The algorithm details are presented in Algorithm 1, treating \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter. In applications, \u2207L \u00b7 u won't be zero, especially when only theoretical analysis suggests E u [\u2207L \u00b7 u] = 0. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 perturbs parameters with small gradients below \u03b2 2, using a per-parameter \u03c1 i to capture Hessian variation. Perturbation level decreases with epoch, compared against original optimization on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model. Different optimization methods and parameters are used for each dataset. The perturbation parameters used in the algorithm include \u03b7 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 10. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Perturbed optimization shows similarities to regularization, with training accuracy decreasing but validation accuracy increasing. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout by applying varying levels of perturbation to different parameters. The perturbedOPT algorithm outperforms dropout by applying varying levels of perturbation to different parameters, leading to improved validation set performance. The model generalization power is linked to the smoothness of the solution and the Hessian, with the best perturbation level scaling inversely with the square root of the Hessian. This integration of Hessian in the generalization bound is a novel approach, explaining the impact of re-parameterization on generalization. A new metric for testing model generalization and a perturbation algorithm adjusting levels based on the Hessian are proposed. The section discusses a toy example using a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3 Gaussians. A 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss is used, with only two free parameters. The model is trained with 100 samples, showing multiple local optima in the loss function plot. In a 2-dimensional toy example with a 5-layer MLP model, multiple local optima are observed in the loss function plot. The generalization metric scores show a sharp global optimum and a flat local optimum, with the latter having a similar overall bound despite slightly higher loss. Predictions from both optima are compared, highlighting the differences in generalization capability. The text discusses plotting predicted labels from sharp and flat minima in a 2-dimensional toy example with a 5-layer MLP model. Truncation of the Gaussian distribution is done to meet bounded perturbation requirements. The text also mentions choosing prior \u03c0 as N(0, \u03c4 I) and approximating bounds with \u03b7 = 39 using inequalities. Additionally, it talks about solving for the best \u03c3 i when L(w) is convex around w * and introduces Lemma 4 related to loss function l(f, x, y). Lemma 4 states that for a loss function l(f, x, y) \u2208 [0, 1] and bounded model weights, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over n samples, a certain inequality holds. The proof involves optimizing \u03c3 i to minimize a specific term, ultimately completing the proof. The proof involves combining inequalities and equations to optimize a term. A lemma discusses the eigenvalues of the Hessian and generalization. Another lemma addresses correlated perturbations in the loss function. The section discusses the proof of Lemma 5, which involves bounding terms using inequalities and equations. It also compares dropout with a proposed perturbation algorithm using wide resnet architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The study compares the accuracy of dropout rates on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets using wide resnet models. Different dropout rates were tested, with dropout rate 0.3 performing best on CIFAR-10, while dropout rate 0.1 worked better on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. The validation/test accuracy improved with added dropout, especially on datasets with fewer training samples. The study compared dropout rates on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets using wide resnet models. Dropout rate 0.1 worked better on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet, possibly due to the need for more regularization with fewer training samples. The perturbed algorithm showed better performance on validation/test data sets compared to dropout methods, possibly due to different levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures."
