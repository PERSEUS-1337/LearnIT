    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to address acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance: inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and civil enforcement. Inherent contempt encourages compliance with congressional directives, while criminal contempt punishes noncompliance with a subpoena. Civil enforcement through the judicial branch may be necessary to ensure compliance, especially with executive branch officials. The report examines Congress's contempt power and the enforcement of subpoenas, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. It discusses the challenges Congress faces in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials and highlights the broad authority of Congress to investigate and obtain information. The power to punish for contempt is closely tied to Congress's investigative authority. The Supreme Court has established that congressional oversight power is essential for the legislative function, as seen in rulings from the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as crucial for effective legislation, stating that information is necessary for informed decision-making. Experience has shown that requests for information are often ineffective, leading to the need for compulsory means to obtain accurate and complete information. The power of inquiry with enforcing process has been considered essential for effective legislative function since the framing of the Constitution. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to answer questions, citing an ongoing lawsuit and was convicted for contempt of Congress. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress, rejecting the argument that pending lawsuits justified withholding information. Congress has broad investigative authority, as reaffirmed in subsequent Supreme Court rulings. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it includes inquiries into administration of laws and potential statutes, not limited to cases of wrongdoing. The Court emphasized that Congress's investigative power is strongest when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's power to investigate corruption, maladministration, and inefficiencies in government agencies. Congress's inherent contempt power allows for individuals to be brought before the House or Senate, tried, and potentially imprisoned for punitive or coercive purposes. This power was upheld in early Supreme Court decisions and is considered necessary for effective legislative oversight. The House's inherent contempt power allows for individuals to be imprisoned for punitive or coercive purposes, as exemplified in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818. The House adopted a resolution to arrest Anderson for bribery allegations, granting him counsel and defense witnesses during the proceedings. The House granted Anderson counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After hearing his witnesses, the House found him guilty of contempt and directed the Speaker to reprimand him and discharge him from custody. The process established a pattern of attachment, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, compulsory process, counsel, hearing, determination of guilt, and penalty imposition. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available for individuals cited for contempt, focusing on whether the House acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were met. While not required to provide all procedural rights of a criminal defendant, Congress must grant notice and an opportunity to be heard. Although inherent contempt proceedings do not require all the procedural rights of a criminal defendant, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be given. Courts may impose fines instead of incarceration, as seen in the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson. This approach could avoid habeas corpus challenges. Congress could exercise similar inherent authority to impose fines for contemptuous behavior. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson discussed the extent of punishing power of deliberative assemblies, suggesting imprisonment as the least possible power adequate for the end proposed. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court mentioned that Congress may compel testimony in certain cases where it has authority to investigate, using the same means as a court of justice. The power of Congress to punish contempt of Congress through fines or imprisonment is not well-established. Inherent contempt allows Congress to conduct summary proceedings and cite offenders for contempt without the need for cooperation from other branches. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available to contemnors, but the scope may be limited. However, there are limitations to the inherent contempt process, including the possibility of incarceration until compliance is achieved. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to punish contempt without cooperation from other branches, but it has limitations. Imprisonment cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress, and it is considered ineffective and time-consuming. The process has not been used since 1935, and it may be more efficient if initial fact-finding is done by a special committee before a final decision by the full House or Senate. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt process, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney instead of a trial at the bar of the House or Senate. This change was prompted by the limitations and inefficiencies of the inherent contempt process, which involved trials at the bar of the chamber concerned and could not extend punishment beyond a house's adjournment date. The legislation enacted in 1857 introduced a criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt process. This allowed for judicial trial by a United States Attorney instead of a trial at the bar of the House or Senate. Most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house, rather than by the criminal contempt method, due to concerns about obtaining desired information from witnesses after criminal proceedings had been initiated. The current statutory provisions, codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194, outline the penalties for failing to comply with a summons to testify or produce documents. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution instead of trying them at the bar of the House or Senate. The process involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report to the U.S. Attorney, and certification by the Speaker for prosecution. This criminal contempt procedure is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct by witnesses. Once a witness is found in contempt, they cannot purge themselves by testifying or providing documents. After being voted in contempt by the committee and the House or Senate, a witness cannot purge themselves by testifying or providing subpoenaed documents. The U.S. Attorney is duty-bound to bring the contempt before a grand jury, but it is unclear if this duty is mandatory or discretionary. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been voted may result in the House not pursuing further proceedings. The District Court in Washington, D.C. granted habeas corpus petitions for two witnesses charged with violating a statute. The court ordered their release due to procedural errors by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Congress mandated that in cases of uncooperative witnesses, the Speaker of the House or President of the Senate must certify the facts to the district attorney, leaving no room for discretion. The statute mandates the certification of facts to the district attorney, leaving no discretion. The U.S. Attorney is then required to bring the matter before the grand jury. The duty of certifying contempt citations is discretionary during adjournments, as concluded by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The statute mandates that a committee's contempt resolution must be approved by the parent body when Congress is in session. During adjournments, the Speaker or President of the Senate reviews contempt citations, which may involve discretionary decisions. In Wilson, convictions were reversed due to the Speaker certifying contempt citations without exercising discretion. This suggests that the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, despite the statute's mandatory language. U.S. Attorneys generally have broad prosecutorial discretion, even when statutes use mandatory language. Congress can appeal to the authority of the U.S. Attorney when inherent or criminal contempt is not applicable. Congress may appeal to the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, involving filing a suit in federal court. The Senate has statutory authority for this, while the House has pursued civil enforcement through a resolution. In 1978, a civil enforcement procedure was enacted for the Senate, giving jurisdiction to the U.S. District Court in D.C. for enforcement actions. The U.S. District Court in D.C. has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas. The Senate can seek compliance or a declaratory judgment through a two-step process. The court will first review the subpoena's validity before any enforcement action. The U.S. District Court in D.C. has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas. The court's jurisdiction is limited to the matter Congress brings before it, regarding aiding Congress in enforcing the subpoena. If the court orders compliance with the subpoena and the individual refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to a federal government officer or employee in their official capacity. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena. Past precedent includes the 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The federal courts have jurisdiction over such claims, as established in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. The lawsuit filed sought a declaratory judgment for compliance with subpoenas. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss based on jurisdictional arguments. The court adopted reasoning from Miers on jurisdictional and justiciability arguments, addressing federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. The court denied motions for summary judgment and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. Authorization by resolution of the full House is legally required for civil enforcement of subpoenas. The court has not yet reached the merits of the executive privilege question. The President conferring jurisdiction is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The DOJ acknowledges civil enforcement as the preferred method, but Congress cannot use inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures against executive branch officials invoking executive privilege. The Attorney General has directed against pursuing criminal contempt prosecution in such cases. This view is supported by DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel opinions from the mid-1980s. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel has advised against pursuing criminal contempt prosecution for executive branch officials invoking executive privilege. This stance has been evident in past contempt proceedings, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts to enforce subpoenas. The 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner suggests a broadening of the executive branch's position on criminal contempt. The House held Ms. Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about her role in the IRS targeting conservative groups. Despite the House's approval, the DOJ has not pursued criminal charges. This differs from past cases where executive officials invoked executive privilege to refuse compliance with subpoenas. The dispute with Ms. Lerner involves her refusal to comply with a subpoena based on her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, not executive privilege. The DOJ's decision not to pursue criminal charges for contempt of Congress in this case extends beyond situations involving executive privilege. Congress faces challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through criminal contempt. The DOJ's decision not to pursue criminal charges for contempt of Congress in cases involving executive branch officials raises challenges in enforcing subpoenas. While Congress has the constitutional authority to issue and enforce subpoenas, criminal contempt may not be effective when the President endorses noncompliance. However, in cases where the President does not endorse the official's conduct, criminal contempt remains a viable option for punishing executive officials. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute officials for contempt, either due to merit or to avoid setting a precedent. Congress can enforce subpoenas through civil action, but it may not be timely. Litigation could involve a lengthy appeals process, as seen in the Miers case. The Miers litigation, which was dismissed after 19 months, resulted in the committee gaining access to withheld information. However, the change in administrations and passage of time weakened the committee's oversight abilities. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch or civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas promptly, but it retains the power to enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
