    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerous levels, leading to heart failure. Federal investment in research must be increased to find a cure, as the disease is difficult to diagnose and often confused with other conditions. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerous levels, leading to heart failure. New diagnostic standards have improved diagnosis rates. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and may become completely bedridden. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, providing valuable insights into the disease. Research is ongoing to understand the causes and progression, focusing on immunologic and genetic factors. Research is ongoing to understand the causes and progression of pulmonary hypertension, focusing on immunologic and genetic factors. Treatments for the condition include FDA-approved medications and lung transplantation as a last resort. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension has increased, necessitating more education for medical professionals. In 2001, there were 100 physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, with 3,000 patients receiving treatment. By 2006, the number of physicians increased to 3,000, treating 30,000 patients. Despite the availability of oral therapies, managing pulmonary hypertension remains complex. Education of medical professionals is crucial for optimal patient care. In December 2006, a significant meeting of pulmonary hypertension researchers and clinicians was held, emphasizing the importance of communication for future advancements in treatment. At a meeting, researchers agreed that communication is crucial for advancing in the fight against pulmonary hypertension. SEC. 3. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK; EXPANSION OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND TRAINING. Subpart 2 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 424B the following section: \"pulmonary hypertension\" The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials and collaborate on new treatment approaches for pulmonary hypertension. The network will include clinical centers, an institute project scientist, and a data and coordinating center. The Director will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network with clinical centers, a data and coordinating center, a safety monitoring board, a steering committee, and a protocol review committee to conduct clinical trials and publish results. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network will develop protocols for clinical trials on combination therapies, new drug avenues, endothelial progenitor cell use, and treatment effects prediction. The Institute will manage and support the network, with a project scientist monitoring subject recruitment. The project scientist appointed under paragraph (1)(B) will monitor subject recruitment and trial progress, ensure disclosure of conflicts of interest, and manage fiscal aspects with the institute grants management specialist. The institute grants management specialist will assist in fiscal management. The Director will appoint the Chair of the steering committee and protocol members. The Director appoints the Chair of the steering committee, protocol review committee members, and data safety monitoring board. A grant program will be established for a Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to educate medical professionals by experienced specialists in clinical settings. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program aims to increase the number of physicians trained to diagnose and manage pulmonary hypertension. It will establish regional training sites across the United States at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices. Each site will have a designated contact and receive a stipend from grant funds. Participant recruitment and program guidelines will be specified by the Director. The nonprofit entity awarded the grant will establish mechanisms for recruiting health professionals and enrolling them in the program. Model guidelines for the program will be developed in collaboration with regional training sites and the Institute. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, diseases linked to it, early diagnosis importance, and treatment options. Information will be disseminated through a national non-profit entity. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to health professionals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to health care providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis importance, diagnostic criteria, and FDA-approved therapies. This information will be shared through a national non-profit entity with expertise in pulmonary hypertension. Authorization of Appropriations for pulmonary hypertension research from 2009 to 2012. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, including all FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider outpatient or home health care settings for service delivery. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
