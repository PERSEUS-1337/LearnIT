    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing Employment and Training Through Education Act of 2013.\" It includes pilot projects to reduce dependency and increase work effort in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Section 17 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended to include pilot projects aimed at increasing work effort and reducing dependency in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The projects will focus on identifying best practices for employment and training programs to help participants secure unsubsidized employment, increase earned income, and decrease reliance on public assistance. Pilot projects will be selected based on criteria set by the Secretary, including enhancing existing programs and agreeing to participate in evaluations. The pilot projects under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 aim to increase work effort and reduce dependency in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Criteria for selecting projects include collaboration with workforce boards, replicability, and targeting diverse populations of work registrants. Existing employment and training programs include section 20 workfare, skills development for work registrants with limited employment history, post-employment support services, and education leading to recognized credentials. These programs are located in various geographic areas and include participants who are exempt and not exempt under specific sections. The Secretary will conduct evaluations of these programs. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of pilot projects selected under a subsection to measure their impact on the target population's ability to find and retain employment leading to increased household income and reduced dependency. A report including results of each pilot project, evaluation of their impact on employment, income, and public benefit receipt, as well as the costs involved, will be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2017. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of pilot projects to measure their impact on the target population's employment and income. $10,000,000 will be available annually for pilot projects that comply with the Act, covering costs and administration. The Act provides funds for pilot projects' costs, administration, information/data provision, and evaluation. Funds cannot replace non-Federal funds for existing employment and training activities."
