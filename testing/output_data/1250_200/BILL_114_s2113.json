    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges, such as paying only for success and increasing cost-effectiveness. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity and encourage their appropriate use to advance agency missions. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits like improving government services with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to agency missions, acquiring data at a greater extent, and enabling citizens to address community concerns through data gathering and sharing. Citizen science enables citizens to address community concerns by gathering, analyzing, and sharing data. It accelerates scientific research, improves science literacy, furthers science diplomacy, and builds trust between citizens and scientists. Federal agencies should consider meaningful participation in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. Federal agencies should provide incentives for participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems in society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, definitions are provided for key terms such as \"citizen science\" and \"crowdsourcing,\" which involve individuals or organizations participating in the scientific process in various ways. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" is defined as a government agency. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. A \"Federal agency\" includes Executive agencies and military departments but excludes legislative branch agencies. A \"participant\" is an individual or entity volunteering in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. A \"related entity\" encompasses Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, customers, and others associated with a Federal agency. The head of each Federal agency, or multiple agencies working together, can use crowdsourcing and citizen science to further their missions. Participants can provide voluntary services for these projects without financial compensation, as long as they are not displacing any federal employees. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote and encourage broad participation. Agencies can determine the level of consent, registration, or terms of use required from participants on a project basis, disclosing privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly to participants. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must ensure clear communication of compensation, service terms, and consent methods to participants. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and data collected should be made publicly available in machine-readable formats with notification of data use to participants. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must notify participants of data usage, ownership, availability, and publication rights. Technologies developed through these projects should be made open to the public. Participants must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal government. Participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must agree to assume all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for claims of willful misconduct. Federal agencies must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity and ethics policies. Federal agencies can partner with private sector entities for administrative duties. In carrying out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can partner with private sector entities, government agencies, and institutions of higher education for funding and support. Special consideration cannot be given in return for funds or support. The General Services Administration will provide assistance to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Federal agencies engaged in these activities are encouraged to consult guidance from the Director. A report must be submitted within 2 years of the Act's date. The Director encourages federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects to consult guidance. A report must be submitted every 4 years detailing the activities conducted under this subsection. Each report includes a summary of projects, participation rates, and other relevant statistics. The report for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects must include details on resources used, project advancements, and results such as publications, tools, and services created. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects should include project results, data quality methods, savings or costs incurred by the Federal Government, challenges faced by Federal agencies, steps taken to address challenges, and recommendations for future action. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects should include project results, data quality methods, savings or costs incurred by the Federal Government, challenges faced by Federal agencies, steps taken to address challenges, recommendations for future action, use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by Federal agencies, interagency partnerships, and any other relevant information. Nothing in this section may affect the authority to conduct crowdsourcing and citizen science under other laws or displace resources allocated to Federal agencies for these projects."
