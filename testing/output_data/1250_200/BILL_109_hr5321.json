The \"Access to Better Choice in Dialysis Act of 2006\" mandates a 5-year pilot project by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assess the impact of increasing payment for hemodialysis treatment beyond 3 times per week. The pilot project outlines specific payment increases for additional sessions per week. The pilot program for hemodialysis treatment includes specific payment increases for additional sessions per week, with funding limitations set for each year of operation.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will evaluate the findings and assess the desirability of expanded Medicare payment for more frequent hemodialysis treatment. The final report will analyze the desirability of expanded Medicare payment for more frequent hemodialysis treatment.
