This helps level the playing field by ensuring fair payments based on factors like gender, age, geography, health status, and more. The report describes how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, including risk adjustment for factors like age, geography, and health status. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B, with payments adjusted for demographics and health status. The Medicare Advantage plan provides required benefits to beneficiaries in exchange for a monthly payment adjusted for demographics and health status. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments are based on bids compared to a benchmark set by CMS. The Medicare Advantage plan receives payments adjusted for demographics and health status. CMS adjusts payments based on characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries. Risk adjustment methodology considers demographic and health factors to estimate future healthcare expenditures. The Medicare Advantage plan payments are adjusted for demographics and health status. Health care expenditures vary by age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Incorporating these variables into payments is straightforward, while incorporating health status is more complex, involving ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and condition categories. The ICD-9-CM codes are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories, which have a hierarchy imposed on them for payment purposes. The codes are organized hierarchically, with only the most significant manifestation of a disease being coded. This hierarchical coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement. There are 189 hierarchical condition codes (HCCs), but only 70 are incorporated into the current CMS. The current CMS model incorporates 70 chronic HCC codes that predict Medicare expenditures, with plans to include 87 HCC codes in 2012. ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes based on diagnosed conditions, not all resulting in an HCC. The CMS model uses HCC codes to predict Medicare expenditures based on diagnosed conditions. Some conditions are excluded from the model if they are not chronic or are short-term illnesses. The model is additive, using the highest code in a related disease category. Risk factors are estimated for each condition, with the total risk score determining the risk-adjusted base payment. The risk score, multiplied by the MA plan's base rate, determines the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects between multiple conditions can result in higher costs than just their additive effects. CMS incorporates these interactions into the CMS-HCC model. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics, diagnoses, and interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability. The model uses a linear regression approach with expenditures predicted by diagnoses and demographic variables, with coefficients periodically recalculated using current claims data. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics, diagnoses, and interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability. Risk scores are standardized to reflect health status and demographics, allowing CMS to individualize payments based on likely costs for treating Medicare beneficiaries. The goal is to predict average expenditure variations, not individual expenditures. The CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses to predict average expenditure variations, not individual expenditures. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. CMS collects data from MA plans to update risk scores for each beneficiary. The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) allows CMS to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries using encounter level data with dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores are adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1 based on data from the prior 12-month period. Errors in age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease can impact risk-adjusted payments. The demographic data, disability status, and Medicaid eligibility for Medicare Advantage payments come from administrative files. Plans submit health status information to CMS for risk-adjusted payments, which are audited through RADV audits to ensure accuracy. CMS audits aim to recover errors in payments associated with sampled enrollees and proposed extrapolating error rates to entire plan contracts for potential savings of $2.27 billion over five years. CMS released a methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plans to extrapolate payment errors to entire contracts, potentially saving $2.27 billion over five years. Audits are conducted at the contract level using a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. Plans may push back against potential recoveries, leading to challenges for some Part C plans. CMS uses samples to reduce the burden on plans to provide data for auditing Medicare Advantage plans. A sample size of 201 enrollees is considered sufficient. Enrollees must meet specific criteria, including being continuously enrolled in the same MA contract for 12 months, having non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage, and at least one risk adjustment diagnosis submitted during the data collection period. The validation HCCs for sampled enrollees are used for risk-adjusted payments. Enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores, with 67 randomly selected from each group. Sampling weights ensure representation of each group in the sample. The enrollee sampling weights are used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the population. The MA plan is required to provide evidence from medical records to substantiate HCC codes they were paid for. Medical records for sampled enrollees are reviewed to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. Plans have 12 weeks to deliver medical records for review. If a diagnosis is not confirmed, payments based on it are considered in error. Plans can appeal findings if they disagree. The MA plan must provide evidence from medical records to support HCC codes for payment. If a diagnosis is not confirmed, payments based on it are considered in error. Plans can appeal findings if they disagree with the initial CMS contractor. The final decision is binding unless a review is requested by the CMS Administrator. Payment errors are corrected based on validated audited CMS-HCCs in the medical record review. Enrollee-level payment errors are calculated as the difference between the original and corrected payments. Enrollee-level payment errors are calculated as the difference between the original and corrected payments, with errors being either positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). The estimated payment error for each MA contract is determined by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The weighted enrollee payment errors are then summed to calculate an estimated payment error for the MA contract, with the payment recovery amount being determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster. The FFS adjuster addresses methodological concerns in RADV audits, adjusting for documentation standards. Payment errors for sampled enrollees are extrapolated to the contract, with a 99% confidence interval calculated for estimated plan error. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan level error is $1,187.50. In RADV audits, the estimated plan error is calculated with a 99% confidence interval, indicating a certainty that the error in payment will fall within this range. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount is limited to $0. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage, with studies showing a distribution of actual costs. Research by MedPAC has raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage, specifically regarding plans enrolling beneficiaries with below average costs but being reimbursed at average rates. MedPAC suggests exploring improvements to the CMS risk adjustment model. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process for Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments, highlighting inconsistencies in the methodology and potential errors in estimating premiums based on actual enrollees' risk profiles. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply those factors only to MA data that are validated, leading to potential payment errors if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. This could result in inadequate payments for diabetic members in the payment year. The Health Practice Council is concerned about potential underpayment and payment inequities in MA plans due to data inconsistency and uncertainty in risk adjustment methodology. The proposed audit process may result in inadequate payments for diabetic members if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. The notice of final calculation methodology for MA plans includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address concerns about risk adjustment. Some plans worry about recoveries from RADV audits putting them at financial risk. Concerns have been raised about using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients. The Secretary's approach to methodological concerns in risk adjustment implementation remains to be seen. Risk adjustment payments to private plans under Medicare are adjusted to account for the variation in healthcare costs among beneficiaries. Different models have been used for risk adjustment, each gaining in complexity and explanatory power. The models aim to predict beneficiary spending based on their characteristics, with the R2 measure quantifying how well the model explains the variation in individual expenditures. The R2 measure quantifies how well different models predict beneficiary spending based on their characteristics. The AAPCC model explains a small percentage of the variation in expenditures, with newer models able to explain more. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) was used prior to payment year 2000 to adjust private plan payments under Medicare. The AAPCC model, which included demographic variables like age and sex, explained less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. It did not consider beneficiary health costs and led to higher payments for private plan enrollees who were generally healthier. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated the use of the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model from 2000 to 2003 to adjust payments based on beneficiary health status. The PIP-DCG model, used to adjust Medicare plan payments, considered the worst principal inpatient diagnosis associated with hospital admissions. It explained more expenditure variation than the AAPCC model but had limitations like not counting illnesses with high costs but no hospital admission. The phase-in schedule for the PIP-DCG model was held at 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003. Starting in 2004, payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which includes information from various healthcare settings. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare payments based on the severity of a beneficiary's illness, considering multiple diseases and interactive effects. It explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation and is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes. Version 12 was recalibrated to increase the explained variation to nearly 11%. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model includes updates to diagnosis codes and expenditure data, increasing the explained variation in Medicare expenditures to nearly 11%. The model underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices, further increasing its predictive power to approximately 12.5%. Scheduled for implementation in 2012 for PACE plans."
