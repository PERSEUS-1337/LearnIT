    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 1997\" is referred to as the short title. The findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of pregnancies in the US are unintended, contraceptive services are essential for family planning, cost-effective, and help reduce the need for abortion. Unintended pregnancies lead to negative health outcomes and economic challenges for families. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality suggests that infant mortality could decrease by 10 percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception. Private insurance in the United States often covers medical expenses, but many exclude prescription contraceptives. Coverage for contraceptives is limited, with a significant gender cost disparity in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. The lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance leads to financial barriers for women seeking reproductive health care services, resulting in unintended pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended Pregnancy recommends increasing coverage for contraceptive services to reduce these barriers. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 include new standards relating to benefits for contraceptives. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 has been amended to include requirements for group health plans and health insurance issuers regarding coverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. This includes prohibiting the exclusion or restriction of benefits for these contraceptives if other outpatient prescription drugs or devices are covered, as well as prohibiting the denial of eligibility based on the individual's use of contraceptives. The section prohibits group health plans from denying coverage based on the individual's use of contraceptives, providing incentives to limit contraceptive services, or penalizing healthcare professionals for prescribing contraceptives. The section allows group health plans to impose deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices, with limitations on the amount that can be charged compared to other prescription drugs covered under the plan. The section mandates that group health plans cover outpatient contraceptive services with limitations on cost-sharing, ensuring they are not greater than those for other outpatient health care services covered under the plan. The group health plan must cover experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, with limitations on restrictions such as healthcare professionals who can prescribe them and volume limits on prescriptions. The group health plan must cover contraceptive services, with restrictions on healthcare professionals and utilization review provisions. Imposition of these requirements is considered a material modification in the plan, requiring notice within 60 days. State laws are not preempted by this section. The section defines outpatient contraceptive services and limits State laws that provide greater protections for enrollees. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act. Section 713 establishes standards for contraceptive benefits, effective for plan years starting on or after January 1, 1998. This amends the Public Health Service Act in the group market, adding section 2706 on benefits for contraceptives. Requirements for Coverage: Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot exclude benefits for FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs or devices, or generic equivalents. They also cannot exclude benefits for outpatient contraceptive services if they provide benefits for other outpatient health care services. Additionally, they cannot deny eligibility based on an individual's use of contraceptives. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from penalizing or limiting coverage for individuals using contraceptive drugs or devices. They cannot offer incentives to healthcare professionals to withhold contraceptive services from covered individuals. Nothing in this section should prevent group health plans from providing coverage for FDA-approved contraceptives. Group health plans and health insurance issuers can impose deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices, but the cost-sharing for these items cannot be greater than that for other outpatient prescription drugs covered under the plan. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must cover outpatient contraceptive services with cost-sharing not exceeding that for other outpatient health care services under the plan. This includes experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must cover experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, with limitations on prescription volume and healthcare professionals. Group health plans must comply with notice requirements and not preempt state laws that provide greater protections for enrollees regarding outpatient contraceptive services. The amendments made by this section define outpatient contraceptive services and apply to group health plans starting on or after January 1, 1998. SEC. 5 of the Public Health Service Act adds new standards for contraceptive benefits in the individual market, effective January 1, 1998."
