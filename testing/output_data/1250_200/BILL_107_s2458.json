    "content": "Establishment of initiatives for predominantly Muslim countries. The Congress finds that negative opinions of the United States in predominantly Muslim countries are distorted by misinformation and propaganda, which is detrimental to US interests. To improve this image, programs promoting American society and values should be established. The Secretary of State is tasked with creating these initiatives. The Secretary of State will establish programs with predominantly Muslim populations, including a journalism program for foreign journalists and students, and a demonstration program to improve public library systems in foreign countries. The Secretary of State will establish programs to advance American values and society, including English language teaching grants, sister city partnerships, and youth ambassador initiatives. These programs aim to increase global cooperation and promote freedom, democracy, and humanitarian assistance. The Secretary of State will establish programs for youth ambassadors to visit the United States for cultural and educational activities. Additionally, efforts will be made to increase awards under the Fulbright exchange program for various individuals. The William Fulbright Educational Exchange Program aims to increase awards for scholars and teachers from the United States studying in predominantly Muslim countries, including subjects related to American studies. The Secretary also seeks to increase Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowships for candidates from these countries. Programs will be carried out under specific acts. The Secretary will establish a database of American and foreign alumni of international exchange programs to promote networking and communication. Additionally, a report will be made on the inclusion of freedom and democracy advocates in educational and cultural exchange programs. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 90 days regarding the inclusion of freedom and democracy advocates in exchange programs. The report will detail the number of grants for exchange programs, measures taken to prioritize supporters of freedom and democracy, and evaluate the openness of US exchange programs to these advocates. Additionally, a statutory construction is outlined. The Act does not authorize visas or admission to the US for inadmissible aliens. $35,000,000 is authorized for the Department of State for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State."
