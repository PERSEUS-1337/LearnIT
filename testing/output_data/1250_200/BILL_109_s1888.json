    "content": "The \"Military Family Support Act of 2005\" allows caregivers of individuals performing military service to use leave for family members. The \"Federal Employees Program\" defines terms like caregiver, covered period of service, employee, and family member for individuals providing care to qualified members of the Armed Forces. The \"Federal Employees Program\" defines terms related to caregivers and qualified members of the Armed Forces, including family members who receive support from the qualified member of the Armed Forces. This support can include medical, financial, and logistical assistance. The term \"qualified member of the Armed Forces\" refers to a member of a reserve component who is on active duty in support of the Armed Forces. The Office of Personnel Management establishes a program for caregivers of qualified members of the Armed Forces on active duty to use sick leave and other available leave during a covered period of service as if it were a medical emergency. During a covered period of service, a qualified member of the Armed Forces can designate a caregiver for their family member by submitting a written designation to the employing agency and the Office of Personnel Management. Leave under this subsection can only be used for caregiver-related purposes. Regulations must be established within 120 days of the effective date. The Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for the caregiver program within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The program will end on December 31, 2007. A caregiver is defined as an employee who is at least 21 years old and capable of caring for themselves and dependents of a qualified Armed Forces member during their service period. The caregiver program under the Act defines an employee as someone from a business entity involved in the program. A family member includes those receiving support from the qualified member of the Armed Forces. The qualified member is defined as a member of the Armed Forces providing care for dependents. The term \"qualified member of the Armed Forces\" refers to a reserve component member or active duty member eligible for special pay.
