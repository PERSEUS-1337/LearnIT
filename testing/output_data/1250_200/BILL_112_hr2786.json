The Congress acknowledges the Holocaust's atrocities, with 6,000,000 Jews and millions of others murdered by Nazis. Approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors in the US require additional support as they age. Many survivors are over 75, with a majority in their 80s and 90s, and over half of those who emigrated from the former Soviet Union live below the poverty line. Holocaust survivors, especially those living below 200 percent of the Federal poverty threshold, are a vulnerable population in the US. Institutionalized settings can have negative effects on them, triggering panic and re-traumatization due to past Holocaust experiences. Approximately two-thirds of survivors live alone, which increases the risk of institutionalization. Low-income survivors rely heavily on social service programs for personal care and meals. Holocaust survivors require services like personal care, meals, transportation, counseling, and mental health support.
