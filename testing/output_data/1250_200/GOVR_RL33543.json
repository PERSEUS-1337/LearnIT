    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending. Efforts for modernization focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Congress faces decisions on program-specific issues in FY2010, such as whether to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35, end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and approve Navy's funding request for nine aircraft in FY2010. The report discusses FY2010 funding for additional F-22s and F/A-18E/Fs, including the possibility of a multiyear procurement arrangement. Key issues include the affordability of modernizing tactical aircraft and the future of the U.S. industrial base. This legislative activity is covered in CRS reports on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. The curr_chunk discusses the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft, specifically fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat aircraft that operate within a single regional theater of operations. The distinction between tactical and strategic aircraft is highlighted, with strategic aircraft like B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers designed for longer-range missions. Tactical aircraft, including fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for specific combat roles. Fighters are for air-to-air combat, strike fighters for dual air-to-ground and air-to-air operations, and attack planes for air-to-ground missions. They operate from land bases or aircraft carriers and are used for various missions. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are versatile in performing air-to-air and air-to-ground combat missions. They are crucial for establishing air superiority, providing close air support, conducting battlefield air interdiction, and deep interdiction operations. The Air Force operates F-22, F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft, while the Navy operates F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F strike fighters. The Marine Corps also utilizes tactical aircraft for various operations, including surveillance and reconnaissance. The U.S. military operates a variety of tactical aircraft, including F-22, F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft in the Air Force, F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F strike fighters in the Navy, and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes in the Marine Corps. In early 2009, the Department of Defense had a total inventory of about 3,500 tactical aircraft, with modernization efforts focused on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the three services at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-D and AV-8B Harrier VSTOL, and the Navy is getting the F-35C for carrier operations. The Navy is procuring the F-35C to replace F/A-18A-D strike fighters and AV-8B Harrier VSTOL attack planes. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The Air Force F-22 fighter, known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with stealth capabilities and high maneuverability. The administration wants to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and did not request funding for additional F-22s in FY2010. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, larger and more modern than earlier Hornets. It is considered a fourth-generation aircraft, with some fifth-generation technology. The Navy has been procuring Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024. The Air Force and Navy are facing projected fighter aircraft shortfalls, with the Air Force potentially lacking up to 800 aircraft by 2024 and the Navy-Marine Corps facing a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some question the accuracy of these projections, suggesting they are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual needs. The Navy's shortfall depends on factors like service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. In response, the Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft to address the issue. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, in order to generate savings for other program needs. This plan aims to create a smaller and more capable force by reallocating resources for higher priority missions. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley announced a plan to restructure fighter aircraft, converting legacy fighters and F-22s into a smaller, more lethal force bridging to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over five years will be used to address capability gaps, invest in advanced modifications, procure munitions, and enhance intelligence capabilities. This decision was made after assessing the current threat environment. The Air Force announced a plan to restructure fighter aircraft, moving manpower to emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a B-52 squadron, and enhancing information processing capabilities. This decision was made to address capability gaps and modernize the fighter force. The Air Force is restructuring fighter aircraft to focus on emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for unmanned combat air patrols and enhancing information processing capabilities. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and fielding 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The issue of tactical aircraft modernization affordability is a concern due to insufficient funding. Plans to increase F-35 procurement rates are being considered, with past plans aiming for 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions have been made since the 1990s, partly due to post-Cold War changes in Air Force and Navy air wings. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan and the F-35 program aim to reduce costs for tactical aircraft modernization. However, the affordability of DOD's modernization plan remains uncertain, especially with potential budget constraints and projected fighter shortfalls. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans is uncertain due to potential budget constraints and projected fighter shortfalls. This could lead to funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems or other aircraft that can perform similar missions. Some suggest reducing funding emphasis on tactical aircraft in light of regional anti-access capabilities of countries like China. In light of regional anti-access capabilities, some argue for less funding on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft. This includes funding for different mission aircraft like airlift, refueling tankers, electronic attack, surveillance, and UAVs. The affordability of DOD's aircraft modernization plans is a concern, with potential tradeoffs between tactical aircraft and unmanned combat aerial vehicles. UAVs and UCAVs are increasingly important in ground-attack operations, especially for precision strikes on terrorist targets. The DOD plans to focus more on these aircraft for irregular warfare operations. There is a debate on funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft like the F-22 and F-35A versus sea-based Navy and Marine Corps aircraft like the F/A-18E/F and F-35 Bs and Cs. The administration's proposal to halt F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and prioritize the F-35A for future Air Force tactical aircraft procurement is a point of contention. The DOD is considering tradeoffs in funding for procurement of different tactical aircraft, such as upgrading older models like F-15s and F-16s instead of purchasing new F-22s and F-35s. These decisions involve complex considerations of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, and are being reviewed in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently reviewing U.S. military goals and objectives, including the emphasis on irregular warfare operations versus conventional conflict. Some suggest reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and forward air controllers. Others argue that large numbers of high-capability tactical aircraft are still necessary. Some argue for reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and forward air controllers. However, others believe that large numbers of advanced aircraft are still necessary due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Concerns have been raised about China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs, potentially challenging U.S. airpower in the future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio at the request of Representative Neil Abercrombie. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for recapitalizing and modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The military services plan to spend about $109.3 billion to acquire 570 new tactical aircraft and modernize operational aircraft. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar issues are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), with increased development costs and slipping schedules. The JSF is crucial for future modernization efforts, but faces challenges in funding and delivery schedules. The development costs of operational systems have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Legacy aircraft must be sustained until new systems are ready to replace them, but uncertainties in costs and deliveries make planning challenging. The services are investing an average of $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. The Department of Defense lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently to acquire resources, leading to capability gaps and cost overruns. Future aircraft acquisition plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels. The Department of Defense lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Future aircraft acquisition plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels due to unrealistic assumptions and competing priorities for funding. GAO recommends DOD to shorten cycle times for developing new aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Department of Defense is urged to take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing new tactical aircraft and to develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. A study by the Congressional Budget Office examined the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans and compared alternative approaches to modernize the fighter forces. The report highlights the need to maintain fighter inventories at levels called for by current service requirements. The report issued in May 2009 discusses the modernization goals for the fighter force, emphasizing increased capability with state-of-the-art aircraft. Despite potential decreases in fighter inventories, aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability of new fighters. The report from May 2009 emphasizes the need for modernization of the fighter force to increase capability with new state-of-the-art aircraft. Alternative approaches like purchasing upgraded legacy aircraft could offer short-term relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements compared to purchasing JSFs. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would provide improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Force structures that replace some fighters with smaller numbers of attack aircraft could provide comparable air-to-ground weapons capacities at costs similar to DoD's plans. This could impact employment levels and the structure of the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, currently dominated by Lockheed and Boeing. The potential reduction of prime contractors for tactical aircraft production, with Lockheed being the sole contractor, raises concerns about competition, innovation, pricing, and quality. Questions for Congress include the need for multiple contractors, the value of competition, and Boeing's ability to maintain skills for future competition against Lockheed. The curr_chunk discusses legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization, specifically focusing on a report requirement for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement. The report must detail the number of aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025. The report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 must include the number of aircraft needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs for single and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear contracts, feasibility of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization, and recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract. The Secretary's recommendations for authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including advanced capabilities like AESA radar and enhanced avionics. The term '4.5 generation fighter aircraft' refers to current fighters with advanced armaments deployment abilities. Section 1032 requires a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects detailed analyses on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, specifically regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Section 1047 would delay the retirement of fighter aircraft as per the combat air forces restructuring plan. The provision in section 1047 delays the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft as per the combat air forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted to Congress. It also prohibits personnel reassignments and requires continued funding for operations and maintenance. The Air Force is required to use at least $344,600,000 for the operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Additionally, $10,500,000 must be allocated for necessary modifications. A report must be submitted to Congress detailing plans to address force structure and capability gaps, assessment of threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, and ongoing environmental analyses. The Air Force must allocate funds for the operation and maintenance of fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. A report to Congress must detail force structure plans, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, and funding needs for the restructuring plan. In 2010, Congress expressed the need for the Navy to maintain at least 10 carrier air wings, each with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation assets, most aircraft in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2647 expresses concerns about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could lead to serious gaps in force structure and capability. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2647 raises concerns about the Air Force's decision to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. The committee identified unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget, recommending reallocating $344.6 million for the continued operation and maintenance of the legacy fighters until replacement aircraft are available. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2647 raises concerns about the Air Force's decision to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. The committee recommends $10.5 million for aircraft procurement modifications to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024, impacting future operational requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report to Congress by March 1, 2010. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2647 raises concerns about the Air Force's decision to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. The committee recommends $10.5 million for aircraft procurement modifications to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024, impacting future operational requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of the Air National Guard, and Chief of the Air Force Reserve to provide a report to Congress by March 1, 2010. The report should address the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions including accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. The report must include a detailed analysis of the impact on the Air National Guard and air sovereignty alert mission. The report also addresses concerns about the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The committee is concerned about the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with predicted inventory shortfalls in fiscal years 2009, 2010, and potentially reaching 312 aircraft by 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include reductions in F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. The committee finds these shortfalls unacceptable and emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and believes that a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than other options. The provision in the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into such a contract for the purchase of additional aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports the purchase of additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address the Navy's strike-fighter inventory shortfall. The committee also recommends maintaining no less than ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. Additionally, a report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of older F/A-18A-D aircraft versus procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Navy is facing a significant aircraft inventory shortfall as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C is available. The committee is concerned about this gap and the Navy's failure to provide a mandated report on procurement costs. The projected shortfall in Navy tactical aviation could be as high as 250 aircraft, based on questionable assumptions. The Navy is facing a significant shortfall in its tactical air fleet, with a projected gap of up to 250 aircraft. The committee is concerned about the potential risks to national security due to this shortfall and criticizes the Navy for not taking effective action to address it. The delay in addressing the shortfall raises concerns about security risks, reliance on costly service life extension programs, and inadequate long-term procurement planning. The Navy is facing a shortfall in its tactical air fleet, with a projected gap of up to 250 aircraft. Concerns are raised about the Navy's reliance on costly service life extension programs for legacy F/A-18 aircraft, with uncertainties about achieving additional flight hours. The committee suggests considering long-term procurement plans for new F/A-18E/F aircraft instead of SLEP, which may be more cost-effective. The committee suggests that investing in new F/A-18E/F aircraft may be more cost-effective than pursuing a service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. The new models offer improved technological capabilities and lower cost per flight hour compared to the SLEP option. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040, with advanced features like array radar, modernized avionics, and added weapon hard points. The Department of Defense intends to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review, including cost differentials between single year and multiyear procurement strategies. The committee expects the Department to analyze the tradeoffs between a SLEP and new procurements of the F/A-18E/F for tactical aviation procurement decisions. The Department of Defense will use the Quadrennial Defense Review to inform tactical aviation procurement strategies, especially in addressing the strike-fighter shortfall. A provision in H.R. 2647 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft, including factors influencing force structure decisions for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Additionally, the Air Force is prohibited from retiring aircraft under Section 1075 of H.R. 2647. Section 131 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days. The report must include the number of aircraft needed for the Air Force to maintain 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs through annual and multiyear contracts for fiscal years 2011-2025. The report mandated by Section 131 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide details on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including estimated costs through annual and multiyear contracts for fiscal years 2011-2025. The report must also cover the savings potential of multiyear contracts, a cost-benefit analysis between annual and multiyear procurement, and the feasibility of procuring F-35 aircraft to re-capitalize the Air National Guard. The term \"4.5 generation fighter aircraft\" refers to current fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and the ability to deploy advanced armaments. Section 1052 requires a report on force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, including analyses supporting the findings and changes in minimum military requirements. Major military capabilities are defined broadly. Section 1075 addresses combat air forces restructuring. Section 1075 of the Quadrennial Defense Review prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft and reassignment of Air Force personnel until a detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps is submitted to the Committees on Armed Services. The detailed plan required for the retirement of fighter aircraft includes addressing force structure and capability gaps, assessing the current threat environment and capabilities, outlining follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015, cost avoidance estimates, and investment plans for modernization. The future-years defense plan includes investments to modernize the remaining fighter force and ensure its desired service life. Congress finds that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings, each composed of 44 strike-fighter aircraft, in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. The Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft each, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure this requirement is met until modifications to the carrier air wing force structure are justified. The Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller but more capable strike fighter force will be challenging, and additional 4.5 generation fighter procurement may be considered where necessary. The Air Force may consider procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract, specifically F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities, if conditions warrant. Congress expects analysis and proposal submission as required by law, without modifying existing requirements. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's proposed combat forces restructuring plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. They directed that reports be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees and raised concerns about the full implementation of the restructure. The Committee is concerned about the Air Force's proposed restructuring plan and the potential costs associated with removing F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. They have directed the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis within 180 days, including factors impacting training quantity and quality at Tyndall and Kingsley Field. The report should also address where certain training programs will be established, simulator access, instructor base quality, construction requirements, and special considerations. The Committee requests a cost benefit analysis on the Air Force's restructuring plan, including factors affecting training at Tyndall and Kingsley Field. They also ask for reports on simulator access, instructor quality, construction needs, and special considerations. Additionally, an independent review on the impact of the restructure on combat air forces is directed. No funds can be used for the restructure until all reports are submitted. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo, aging aircraft, and delays in the introduction of the F-35. The Navy is forecasting critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory, with the shortfall now estimated to be over 200 aircraft. No funds can be used for the restructure until all reports are submitted. The Navy is facing a strike fighter shortfall of over 200 aircraft due to aging planes and delays in the F-35 program. The prediction for this year's budget includes a reduction in the number of F-18 aircraft being purchased, which is causing confusion as it goes against expectations. The production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective planes, but the Navy is missing out on the opportunity for a multi-year procurement strategy. The Navy is facing a strike fighter shortfall due to aging planes and F-35 delays. The Committee recommends a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to save costs and mitigate the shortfall. Additionally, funds are allocated for the procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the issue. The Committee is concerned about the Navy's strike fighter shortfall due to aging planes and F-35 delays. To address this, an increase of $512,280,000 is provided to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010. The Senate approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Senate approved an amendment to limit the early retirement of tactical aircraft by the Air Force until a detailed plan is submitted to fill force structure and capability gaps. The Senate approved an amendment to limit the early retirement of tactical aircraft by the Air Force until a detailed plan is submitted. The plan includes follow-on missions for affected bases, criteria for base selection, personnel reassignment, cost avoidance estimates, and fund investment details. This appendix contains Air Force briefing slides on the combat air forces restructuring plan."
