The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the goal of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA and its Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation to countries worldwide. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in TC assistance from 1997 through 2007, with over $4,400,000 in assistance in 2008. Proliferation concerns persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment, technology, and expertise provided through the Technical Cooperation Program. The GAO report highlighted concerns about the dual-use nature of nuclear technology provided through the Technical Cooperation Program, particularly in relation to Iran's nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The report also noted challenges in identifying and addressing proliferation risks due to limited information and shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's provision of nuclear technology to countries like Iran, highlighting the dual-use nature of the technology. It also questioned the effectiveness of IAEA safeguards in preventing the program from contributing to weapons development in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and subsequent legislation prohibited funds for certain countries and projects, including Cuba, Iran, and Libya. The GAO report recommended withholding funding for IAEA projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities. The GAO report suggests withholding funding from the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries like Iran, in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions. The IAEA has reported Iran's continued work on heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. UN Security Council Resolution 1737 limits technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes. The IAEA restricts technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes only, prohibiting support for proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. Iran has 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, with a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Concerns persist about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about Iran's lack of cooperation in implementing the Additional Protocol and providing access to key nuclear-related locations, which hinders assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. This lack of transparency raises suspicions about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. Iran has consistently refused to comply with IAEA resolutions regarding its nuclear program, blocking inspections and denying access to key facilities. Recent reports indicate Iran denied access to its Natanz enrichment site and refused to allow additional surveillance cameras. In April 2008, US officials revealed Syria's secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour, built with North Korea's help. The reactor was capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons and was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated the reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour resembled an undeclared nuclear reactor. Syria has not provided requested documentation regarding the nature of the destroyed building. The IAEA Director General stated that Syria has not provided requested documentation or access to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. No US funds to IAEA can support Technical Cooperation for countries like North Korea that sponsor terrorism, breach agreements, or are under investigation. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions proportional to IAEA spending on assistance from 2007 to 2008. The Secretary of State must withhold US funds from the IAEA if assistance is not suspended to countries described in subsection (a) within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. Within six months of enactment, the President must report to Congress on this Act. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" defines a country that has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism."
