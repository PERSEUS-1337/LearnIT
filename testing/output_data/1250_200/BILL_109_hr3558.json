Congress finds that the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, a component of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, flooded the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, causing economic and cultural damage to the tribe. Compensation has been provided to affected Indian tribes, including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act created the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund to compensate tribe members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Act aims to provide compensation and capitalize the Trust Fund. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act established the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund to compensate tribe members for land lost to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to ensure fair compensation for land lost to the Oahe Dam and Reservation project. The Act emphasizes that the United States did not adequately compensate the Tribe and landowners for the acquired land, and calls for proper compensation to be provided. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to define terms like \"member landowner\" and \"power program\" related to land acquisition for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. Additionally, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund section is updated to address funding under the Act. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit 25 percent of the amount from the power program into the Fund annually, starting from October 1, 2004, until the total deposited amount equals $290,722,958 plus accrued interest. The Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit 25 percent of the power program amount into the Fund annually, starting from October 1, 2004, until the total deposited amount equals $290,722,958 plus accrued interest. The interest and earnings are determined by applying the Lehman Government Bond Index. Beginning on October 1, 2005, additional compensation may be provided to member landowners as part of the plan. The Act allows for additional compensation to member landowners for land acquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Secretary of the Interior must provide records to help the Tribe process claims of heirs of member landowners. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and member landowners are eligible for certain programs and services."
