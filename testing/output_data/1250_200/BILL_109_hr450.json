    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology for advancing human understanding and improving lives. Over half of the country's economic growth is attributed to research and development in these fields, with fundamental research exploring the universe and applied research addressing everyday problems. The United States needs to focus on education to promote economic growth by developing intellectual capital in the form of scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate voters and consumers. This is crucial for the country's competitiveness and innovation in a science-based, high-technology workplace. The United States must improve K-12 science and mathematics education to compete globally. New teaching methods, curricula, teacher training, and parental involvement are needed. Science education should focus on inquiry, experiments, and concepts. Science education should be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and concept-based, starting at an early age and continuing throughout school. Teachers play a crucial role in connecting students with the content they are learning, and high-quality, well-trained teachers are essential. Incentives for teachers to remain in the classroom and improve their practice, along with ongoing training, are necessary for superior results. Teachers need to be knowledgeable about their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research, and effective teaching techniques. Teachers need to be knowledgeable about their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research, and effective teaching techniques to connect information to their students in the classroom. SEC. 3.

The 'defense dependents' education system' is the program established under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978. The term 'STEM teacher externship expenses' refers to amounts paid for STEM teachers to participate in training programs in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. These programs are established by businesses to enhance teaching skills and knowledge in STEM areas.
