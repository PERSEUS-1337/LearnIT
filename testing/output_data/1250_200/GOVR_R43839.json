    "content": "In the mid-1990s, six states challenged the federal government's failure to control illegal immigration, resulting in losses for the states in court. The courts viewed arguments based on the U.S. Constitution's clauses and the Tenth Amendment, with states claiming disproportionate costs due to the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws. The Naturalization Clause grants Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, but it does not obligate the federal government to reimburse states for costs related to immigration. U.S. Courts of Appeals have found that the clause does not require compensation for states affected by unauthorized aliens or non-governmental third parties. The Supreme Court has upheld the federal government's plenary powers in immigration matters. The Supreme Court has upheld the federal government's plenary powers in immigration matters, rejecting claims that the government violated the Guarantee Clause by not compensating states for immigration-related expenditures. Multiple circuit courts have also rejected the argument that states were deprived of a republican form of government by being forced to spend money on unauthorized aliens. The Supreme Court has generally viewed alleged violations of the Guarantee Clause as nonjusticiable \"political questions,\" noting that the state's form of government remained unchanged and the electorate had the opportunity to hold officials accountable. Claims that the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws violated the Invasion Clause were rejected by multiple circuit courts, as they believed the legislative and executive branches were responsible for enforcement. The judicial branch lacked manageable standards for determining if unauthorized aliens constituted an \"invasion.\" Courts rejected states' claims that federal government violated Tenth Amendment by \"forcing\" them to provide benefits to unauthorized aliens. Courts found Medicaid spending as a permissible exercise of Congress's spending power. The courts found that the states' claims of federal government commandeering in providing benefits to unauthorized aliens were not successful. They determined that the costs of incarcerating unauthorized aliens were not a result of federal government commands, and that providing education to unauthorized alien children was an obligation of the states due to constitutional interpretation. The states' statutory claims were also unsuccessful in proving violations of specific provisions of the INA. The court cited various provisions supporting claims related to controlling borders, detaining aggravated felons, deporting convicted aliens, criminal penalties for illegal reentry, and state reimbursement for imprisonment costs. The court rejected states' claims involving immigration matters as committed to agency discretion and not reviewable by courts, despite statutes using the word \"shall.\" Appellate courts did not address whether \"shall\" indicated mandatory agency action, even when discretion was not evident in the law. In three cases, courts rejected the idea of federal officials abdicating their responsibilities in enforcing immigration laws. The Supreme Court's 1985 decision in Heckler v. Chaney recognized an exception to agency discretion in enforcing immigration laws. The federal courts of appeals found that the federal government's immigration enforcement policies in the mid-1990s did not constitute an abdication of responsibilities. Arizona asserted counterclaims in 2011. In 2011, Arizona challenged the federal government's alleged failure to enforce immigration laws in litigation over S.B. 1070, which required state and local police to check immigration status. Arizona claimed federal policies violated the Constitution and federal statute. Arizona alleged that federal officials violated federal statutes by failing to protect the state from illegal immigration and refusing to reimburse for associated costs. The federal government challenged Arizona's standing, but the court presumed standing based on Arizona's allegations. Arizona alleged that federal officials violated federal statutes by failing to protect the state from illegal immigration and refusing to reimburse for associated costs. The reviewing federal district court found that Arizona had standing based on its allegations. However, Arizona did not succeed on the merits of its arguments, as the court ruled that its claims were precluded or settled in favor of the federal government by Ninth Circuit precedent. The court also determined that Arizona's remaining constitutional claim regarding the Domestic Violence Clause was not justiciable. The federal district court found that Arizona's statutory claims were not subject to review as they involved actions committed to agency discretion by law, citing provisions of immigration law. The court concluded that each provision lacked a standard for review. The court concluded that provisions involving actions committed to agency discretion lacked a standard for review. Federal officials were granted substantial discretion in determining actions like building fencing and developing a comprehensive program to prevent illegal immigration. The court did not discuss the use of \"shall\" in the statutes challenged by Arizona. In 2012, Mississippi joined a challenge to the Obama Administration's DACA initiative, claiming federal officials failed to enforce immigration laws. This challenge arose from granting deferred action to unauthorized aliens brought to the US as children. The ICE agents and Mississippi challenged the Obama Administration's DACA initiative, claiming it violated the Take Care Clause and impinged on Congress's legislative powers. They argued that DACA did not follow the Administrative Procedure Act and contradicted certain provisions in the INA. ICE agents were initially successful in their claim that DACA violated specific provisions in the INA regarding the admission of aliens. The court found that the \"interlocking\" provisions in Section 235 of the INA require mandatory agency action for aliens seeking admission. However, the court lacked jurisdiction over ICE agents' claims, which was affirmed on appeal. Mississippi was found not to have standing due to its alleged injury being deemed too speculative to satisfy constitutional requirements. The court found that Mississippi did not have standing due to its alleged injury being deemed too speculative to satisfy constitutional requirements. This injury consisted of fiscal costs associated with unauthorized aliens enabled to remain in the state due to DACA and Obama Administration guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement. The federal government argued that Mississippi relied on outdated evidence and offered only conclusory allegations. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that Mississippi lacked standing in a case related to DACA. Mississippi's alleged injury was considered speculative as there was no evidence showing increased costs due to DACA. Multiple states challenged the expansion of DACA and the creation of a DAPA program in 2014, claiming violations of the Take Care clause. The states challenged the DAPA program and DACA expansion, alleging violations of the Take Care Clause and separation of powers principles. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas found that the states have standing to challenge the programs and imposed a preliminary nationwide ban on their implementation. The federal government argued that the programs are immune from judicial review and filed an emergency motion to stay the decision. The federal government appealed the district court's decision regarding standing, reviewability, and procedural requirements of the APA to the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit rejected the government's request for a stay, citing failure to show likelihood of success on the merits of their arguments. The Fifth Circuit later denied the government's appeal, agreeing with the district court in part. The Fifth Circuit denied the government's appeal, agreeing with the district court that the states have standing to challenge DAPA and the DACA expansion. The court also found that the programs should have been subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking and are impermissible under the INA. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision without explanation. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, stating that Texas has standing to challenge the programs. The court also found that the programs should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking and are not allowed under the INA. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, stating that Texas has standing to challenge the programs due to potential significant costs of issuing state-subsidized driver's licenses. The majority ruled that Texas's interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens\" falls within the \"zone of interests\" regulated by the INA. The dissent raised concerns about separation of powers and increased federal-state disputes. The court concluded it can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, stating that Texas has standing to challenge the programs due to potential costs of issuing state-subsidized driver's licenses. The majority ruled that Texas's interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens\" falls within the \"zone of interests\" regulated by the INA. The court can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers by granting \"lawful presence\" to aliens and allowing them to work in the US. The dissent disagreed on the basis for review, arguing that work authorization is not a function of DAPA but of existing regulations. The majority also affirmed that DAPA and DACA expansion should have been implemented through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, stating that Texas has standing to challenge the programs due to potential costs of issuing state-subsidized driver's licenses. The majority ruled that Texas's interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens\" falls within the \"zone of interests\" regulated by the INA. The court can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers by granting \"lawful presence\" to aliens and allowing them to work in the US. The dissent disagreed on the basis for review, arguing that work authorization is not a function of DAPA but of existing regulations. The majority also affirmed that DAPA and DACA expansion should have been implemented through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The court found that DAPA and the DACA expansion violate the APA substantively and procedurally, as they are \"not in accordance with the law\" and \"in excess of statutory ... authority.\" The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, citing Texas's standing to challenge the programs due to potential costs of issuing state-subsidized driver's licenses. The majority found that Congress has directly addressed the issues at hand, precluding DAPA and DACA expansion. Specifically, it pointed to the INA's provisions on lawful entry, discretionary relief from removal, and work authorization, highlighting discrepancies with DAPA's treatment of certain aliens. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, citing Texas's standing to challenge the programs due to potential costs of issuing state-subsidized driver's licenses. The majority found that Congress has directly addressed the issues at hand, precluding DAPA and DACA expansion. Specifically, it pointed to the INA's provisions on lawful entry, discretionary relief from removal, and work authorization, highlighting discrepancies with DAPA's treatment of certain aliens. The majority further noted the \"major policy\" exception to Chevron deference in finding DAPA and the DACA expansion impermissible. The Supreme Court's 4-4 split in United States v. Texas leaves in place a Fifth Circuit decision upholding a ban on DAPA and DACA expansion. This could complicate future executive actions on immigration. States' ability to challenge federal immigration enforcement may be limited. Texas litigation marked the first time a state directed the federal government to delay DAPA and DACA expansion. The Supreme Court's split decision in United States v. Texas upholds a ban on DAPA and DACA expansion, potentially limiting future executive actions on immigration. Texas's ability to challenge federal enforcement was based on specific facts like the costs of issuing driver's licenses to DAPA beneficiaries. This decision may not have broad implications for future state challenges to federal immigration enforcement. In the 2015 Texas decision, the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws was challenged based on the costs of issuing driver's licenses to DAPA beneficiaries. The court found that certain claims failed because states incurred costs due to state laws or grant conditions, not federal government actions. The Obama Administration's proposal to grant deferred action to unauthorized aliens could make them eligible for benefits like work authorization and Social Security numbers. The federal government's proposal to grant deferred action to unauthorized aliens could make them eligible for benefits like work authorization and Social Security numbers, subject to judicial review. The courts view this as an affirmative action by the Executive, not just a matter of enforcement priorities. The district court suggested that immigration officials could designate potential DAPA beneficiaries as low priorities for removal by providing written documentation, without granting deferred action."
