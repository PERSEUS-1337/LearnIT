    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges the serious decline of crane populations globally, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Several species of Asian and African cranes are listed as endangered, including the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, and wattled crane. The Crane Action Plan identifies these species as seriously threatened. The wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane are seriously threatened. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered species with limited populations, making them vulnerable to extinction. Conservation efforts have been insufficient to address the decline in crane populations due to hunting and habitat loss. Cranes are considered flagship species for conservation efforts. Cranes face threats such as egg collection, poisoning, power line collisions, warfare disturbance, and live bird trapping. International cooperation is needed to address these threats and promote conservation efforts for cranes, which serve as ambassadors for goodwill. Efforts from countries in Africa, Asia, North America, and the private sector are required for crane conservation. Cranes are effective ambassadors for promoting goodwill globally due to their migration patterns. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region can be applied to other regions where cranes face similar threats. The United States can learn from and teach conservationists in other countries where government and private agencies collaborate to protect endangered cranes. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The Act defines conservation as methods to ensure crane populations in the wild are sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, management plans, enforcement, and community involvement. The Act focuses on conservation efforts such as enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement, habitat protection through community participation, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The terms \"Convention,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined within the Act. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Applicants from wildlife management authorities in certain regions can submit project proposals for consideration. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Applicants from wildlife management authorities in certain regions can submit project proposals for consideration. Project proposals must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of individuals responsible, methods for implementation and assessment, and staff and community management details. The Secretary will assess project outcomes, staff and community management, logistics, funding estimates, government support, matching funds, and any other necessary information for project eligibility under this Act. The Secretary will review project proposals within 30 days of receipt and consult with relevant Federal officials. Within 180 days of receiving a proposal, the Secretary will consult with the government of each country involved, consider feedback, and approve or disapprove the proposal, notifying all parties accordingly. The Secretary will review project proposals within 30 days, consult with Federal officials, and notify the applicant, Federal officials, and relevant countries of approval or disapproval. Approval criteria include enhancing conservation programs, addressing human-crane conflicts, ensuring compliance with laws, and developing scientific monitoring methods. The curr_chunk outlines the regulations and actions needed for the management and conservation of crane habitat and population. This includes developing scientific monitoring methods, promoting cooperative projects, conducting necessary research, reintroducing cranes into the wild, and providing training and support for effective conservation efforts. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of exchanges among staff managing crane habitats to enhance conservation capacity. It also highlights the criteria for project sustainability and reporting requirements for projects receiving assistance under this section. The curr_chunk discusses the need for project reporting to ensure positive results, assess problems, and foster improvements. It also emphasizes making project reports and related documents available to the public. Additionally, it mentions the convening of a panel of experts to identify conservation needs for cranes. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Crane Conservation Fund. Establishment of the Crane Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, with provisions for funding and expenditures for conservation assistance. The Crane Conservation Fund, part of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, allows for funding conservation projects. The Secretary can use up to 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses. No more than 50% of the Fund can be used for North American crane species projects. The Treasury Secretary can invest Fund amounts in US interest-bearing obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury can acquire obligations for the Crane Conservation Fund either at the issue price or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the Fund. Transfers of required amounts to the Fund are done monthly based on Treasury estimates, with adjustments made for any discrepancies. The Secretary is also allowed to accept and use donations for providing assistance under section 5.

The group must hold open meetings with opportunities for public input, provide timely notice of meetings, and keep minutes available to the public.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$3,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Fund annually from 2004 to 2007, to be available until expended."
