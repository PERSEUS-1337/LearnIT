Some Taliban and Al Qaeda members were radicalized in Pakistani madrasas allegedly funded by Gulf donors. While some accuse madrasas of breeding terrorism, others argue they are vital in impoverished Muslim communities with failing state education systems. The term madrasa can mean \"school\" or an institution teaching Islamic subjects like the Quran and hadith. Madrasas are educational institutions offering instruction in Islamic subjects. They have been under scrutiny for their potential role in promoting extremism since 9/11. The term madrasa can refer to any school promoting an Islamic-based curriculum, but in Pakistan and Bangladesh, it commonly refers to Islamic religious schools at the primary and secondary levels. Madrasas are centuries-old Islamic religious schools that prepare future Islamic scholars through a religious curriculum. They spread rapidly throughout the Muslim world, offering free education and lodging. While secular institutions became more prominent during Western colonial rule, madrasas experienced a revival in the 1970s due to increased interest in religious studies and Islamist politics. Financial support from various countries further boosted madrasas in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the Taliban movement was formed by Afghan Islamic clerics and students who had studied in madrasas and advocated a strict form of Islam. Madrasas have become more popular in impoverished nations due to rising costs and shortages of public educational institutions. Educational institutions have encouraged parents to send their children to madrasas, which offer a religious-based curriculum focusing on the Quran and Islamic texts. Some argue for reforms within Islamic madrasas to ensure a well-rounded curriculum, while others advocate for improving existing schools as an alternative. Radicalized madrasas near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border have been linked to promoting militant Islam and teaching violence, according to a 2003 USAID strategy paper. Some madrasas are criticized for focusing on teaching violence rather than religious scholarship. Concerns also exist about quietist schools promoting rejection of Western culture and outdated teaching methods. Critics suggest introducing science and math content while preserving the religious aspect of madrasa education. Countries are considering proposals to introduce improved science and math content into madrasas' curricula while maintaining their religious character. Madrasas provide free education, room, and board, appealing to impoverished families. Supported by private donations through zakat, these religious schools primarily educate boys, with a few for girls. Concerns have been raised about the spread of radical Islam through donations and curricular material from Persian Gulf governments. The spread of radical Islam through donations and curricular material from Persian Gulf governments is a concern. Critics argue that funding for madrasas should differentiate between charitable projects and support for extremist teachings. Gulf states have faced allegations of permitting fundraising by groups linked to Al Qaeda. Islamic charities in Gulf states continue to provide assistance. Several Islamic charitable organizations in Gulf states support educational projects worldwide, including madrasa building and administration. Pakistan's extensive madrasa system is a concern due to its links to the Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda. Some Pakistanis turn to madrasas for free education due to the country's struggling public education system. Reforming Pakistan's madrasa system is seen as crucial for counterterrorism efforts and stabilizing the Afghan government. Increased U.S. attention to this issue is recommended. Reforming Pakistan's madrasa system is crucial for counterterrorism efforts and stabilizing the Afghan government. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the poor education in Pakistan as a concern, with some madrasas being used as breeding grounds for extremism. Afghan president Karzai urged Pakistan to prevent extremists from using madrasas. In response to reports linking a suicide bomber to a Pakistani madrasa, authorities planned to require registration and financial transparency from all madrasas. Leaders agreed to these requirements in September 2005. In September 2005, madrasa leaders in Pakistan agreed to registration and financial transparency requirements. By January 2007, over 12,000 out of 13,000 madrasas had registered. The government also demanded the expulsion of foreign students by December 31, 2005, with 1,000 leaving by January 1, 2006. Authorities announced plans to deport remaining foreign students in August 2006 if they did not obtain permission to stay. Some groups resisted enforcement efforts, but authorities stated they would not use force to shut down noncompliant madrasas. An airstrike in Bajaur tribal region killed 80 militants in a madrasa near the Afghan border. An air-strike on a madrasa near the Afghanistan border in the Bajaur tribal region killed 80 militants on October 30, 2006, leading to protests in Pakistan. Pakistani security forces raided a girls madrasa linked to the Red Mosque in July 2007, resulting in over 100 deaths in clashes. The U.S. Department of State reported in September 2007 that many Pakistani madrasas were teaching extremist doctrines supporting terrorism, particularly in unregistered and Deobandi-controlled madrasas in FATA and northern Balochistan. Madrasas' popularity is increasing in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia having a significant number of primary and secondary school children attending pesantren. The popularity of madrasas is rising in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia where 20%-25% of primary and secondary school children attend Islamic religious schools known as pesantrens. Concerns have been raised in Bangladesh about madrasas being used by Islamist activists involved in bombing attacks. There is increasing interest in improving U.S. outreach and addressing educational challenges in the Muslim world post-9/11. The 9/11 Commission's Final Report highlighted the importance of addressing education issues in the Islamic world to prevent the growth of Islamist terrorism. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act addresses concerns from the 9/11 Commission's report by establishing an International Youth Opportunity Fund to improve education in the Middle East. USAID committed $100 million for education reform in Pakistan, and funding was requested for ongoing education assistance programs in various Middle Eastern and South/Central Asian countries. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of the 110th Congress also supports these efforts. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 amends and re-authorizes appropriations for an International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund in South and Central Asia. The law requires reports on efforts to increase modern basic education and combat religious extremism and terrorism in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. Additionally, a separate report is needed on U.S. education assistance and the status of the authorized Fund."
