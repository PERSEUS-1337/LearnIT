    "content": "Inland waterways, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, cover 38 states and handle half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees. Maintenance on the Inland Waterway System is fully funded by the Corps, while new construction costs are shared equally. The current financing system for inland waterway system investments is facing challenges due to insufficient revenue from fuel taxes, leading to federal taxpayers covering a significant portion of costs. This shortfall is limiting new construction projects, prompting proposals for changes in the financing system, including potential shifts from fuel taxes to lock usage fees. The user industry proposed a plan for inland waterway costs, including an increase in fuel tax and federal share. Inland waterways have been used for transport since before the nation's founding. Federal funding for waterways began in the early 1800s. Despite decreased reliance due to other transportation modes, inland waterways still play a significant role in freight transport, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Inland waterways account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. They are important for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual traffic on inland waterways has remained relatively flat over the last 20 years. Overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has been increasing at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007. The Department of Transportation predicts that overall freight tonnage will double in the future. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double over the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a rate significantly less than that projected for rail and highway shipping. Almost all of the tonnage transported on inland waterways comes through the Mississippi and Ohio River System, primarily through bulk shipping on barges. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with significant funding provided for investigations, operations, maintenance, and construction costs through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s created user cost-sharing requirements for a subset of these investments. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 transformed inland waterway financing by establishing fuel taxes on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for projects, and a trust fund for construction investments. These laws shifted financial responsibility to commercial operators and reduced federal funding for inland waterway projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, creating the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). The act also set cost-sharing requirements for construction projects, with 50% funded by IWTF and 50% by the Treasury's General Revenue fund. WRDA 1986 further increased the fuel tax to $0.20 per gallon by 1994 and outlined funding for operations and maintenance costs. Under WRDA 1986, the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) is funded by a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, with 50% from IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Construction project expenditures from IWTF require authorization from Congress and annual appropriations. WRDA 1986 authorized initial projects, with subsequent acts authorizing more. Federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance, is 100%. Operations and maintenance costs are federally funded, exceeding construction and major rehabilitation expenses. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established under WRDA 1986 to represent shipping interests and inform federal decision-making on IWTF projects. The board meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress. The IWTF balance has varied significantly between 1986 and 2011, with balances reaching $413 million in 2002. The executive branch has proposed increasing fees on multiple occasions. The IWTF balance reached its highest level of $413 million in 2002. The executive branch proposed increasing fees in 1996 and 2004, but Congress did not enact these proposals. From FY2005, appropriations for IWTF-funded projects increased significantly, exceeding fuel tax collections and interest on the balance. Some projects went over their cost estimates, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress took \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the balance from falling to unsustainable levels, such as exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements in FY2009. In previous years, Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to limit costs to the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) for ongoing projects. These measures included exempting projects from cost-sharing requirements, providing construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and prohibiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding. As a result, the trust fund balance stabilized, but without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects is expected to be limited in the future. Funding for new projects is expected to be limited in the future due to IWTF financing, with most funding going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms have been implemented to address these concerns, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for projects with a high risk of cost overruns. The IWUB implemented reforms to project delivery, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. Advocates call for additional structural reforms, citing cost overruns at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The project's estimated cost increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in 2013. The project is 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with lock components finished and dam components expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024. The project's dam and demolition components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and equity of the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways have led to various proposals by past administrations, including the Bush and Obama Administrations. The user industry has also proposed an increase in fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway investments. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to address potential IWTF shortfall, replacing fuel tax. The fee would charge commercial barges $50-$80 per lockage for chambers over 600 feet and $30-$48 for chambers under 600 feet. It aimed to tie IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. However, Congress rejected this approach, citing it as burdensome for lock users. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress, aiming to increase efficiency and revenues. Congress has generally rejected these proposals, opting for stopgap measures instead. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways to increase revenues, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers. This proposal aimed to maintain the existing fuel tax and implement additional fees based on vessel usage of locks. However, Congress has not enacted any of these proposals yet. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways, including an annual fee for shippers using locks. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but aimed to generate $1 billion in additional revenues over 10 years. The proposal also included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but it was opposed by the industry and not enacted. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed a new financing system and other changes for inland waterways, including increasing user fees. The IWUB report, not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration, has been introduced as legislation in Congress but faced opposition from the Obama Administration. The IWUB proposed a new financing system for inland waterways, including increasing user fees. The primary recommendations include raising the IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon and increasing the Federal Share of Inland Waterway Costs. Other recommendations involve increasing overall spending on inland waterways and enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning. The IWUB proposed increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on fuel tax collections. This would generate approximately $112 million annually, with most revenue saved for future use. The proposal also shifts more project costs to the federal government and reduces cost-sharing for inland waterway projects. The IWUB report recommends exempting dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects under $100 million from cost-sharing requirements. It also proposes a cap on IWTF funds to prevent construction cost overruns, leading to an increase in federal share for new projects to around 70%. The report suggests increasing funding for inland waterways from both IWTF and General Revenue fund. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with annual expenditures averaging $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. Most of the increase needed would be derived from the General Revenue fund initially, with federal funding totaling $1.33 billion over the first five years. The IWUB report proposes an increase in funding for inland waterways projects, with the majority of the required funds coming from the General Revenue fund initially. The report suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness, including increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery and oversight of IWTF investments. The IWUB report recommends increased funding for inland waterways projects, with proposed changes to the IWTF financing system. Projects are prioritized based on asset condition and system performance improvement potential, with final funding decisions to be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal suggests criteria for selecting inland waterway projects to increase likelihood of selection. Advocates have proposed shifting costs from the federal government to users to address inequalities in spending and improve economic efficiency. The CBO concluded that a user fee structure recovering true costs for inland waterway operations would increase economic efficiency. This would result in increased costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios, as federal costs for maintaining these waterways exceed fuel tax receipts. Various entities have proposed significant fee increases to achieve savings for the federal government, with estimated savings ranging from $500 million to $1 billion over the next five years. The CBO proposed increasing user fees on inland waterways to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs, estimating $500 million in savings over five years. Different proposals suggest various forms of user fees, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees, to generate new revenues and address ongoing issues with the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Different proposals aim to address issues with the Inland Waterways Trust Fund by proposing new investment levels and revenue sources. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including project delivery recommendations and cost-sharing requirements. Congress faces questions about the level of investment needed, potential changes to fuel taxes, and cost-share arrangements for projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project from 50% to 15% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). This allowed for more funding from the General Revenue fund and potential for other projects. Additionally, efforts were authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, use of bonds and fees for IWTF financing, and convening a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate inland waterways policy options. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 reduced the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project from 50% to 15% from the IWTF, allowing for more funding for other inland waterways projects. However, it is believed that these changes may not be enough to finance all necessary waterway upgrades in the long-term. Proposed legislation such as H.R. 1149 and S. 407 aim to address the long-term solvency of the IWTF by implementing user proposals, including fuel tax increases and alterations to cost-sharing responsibilities. The RIVER Act (S. 407) proposes the federal government cover 100% of dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million, with a fuel tax increase of $0.09 per gallon. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased investment due to aging infrastructure and environmental benefits, while other groups argue against it. The debate over federal funding for inland waterways continues, with some groups advocating for increased investment while others argue against it. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system is inadequate. The Corps may face delays in projects without new revenue sources or federal appropriations. The condition of inland waterway facilities drives the call for increased investment. The aging infrastructure of Corps inland waterway facilities has led to a decline in efficiency, with most locks in the United States exceeding their intended design age of 50 years. Some advocate for new lock construction and expanded capacity, while others argue for maintenance to extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. The debate over federal funding for inland waterways continues, highlighting the need for increased investment in the face of inadequate financing. Some argue for new lock construction to address aging infrastructure, while others advocate for maintenance to extend lock life at a lesser cost. The Corps notes that new navigation alternatives depend on uncertain traffic forecasts, with total domestic freight traffic expected to increase by 70% by 2020. Shipping interests highlight the projected 2% annual increase in waterway traffic between 2010 and 2035. Increase in freight traffic will be on freight rail and highway traffic, with annual waterway traffic projected to increase 2% per year between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests argue for increased investment in inland waterways to maintain viability compared to other forms of freight shipping. Future lock upgrades or new construction could increase demand for inland waterways, but the effect on demand would depend on external factors. Some groups question the need for new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at some locks. Critics have noted overly optimistic traffic projections by the Corps, which has not used projected traffic increases to change investments on inland waterways. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their efficiency and environmental benefits compared to other modes of shipping. Industry studies show that barge shipping is more fuel-efficient and emits fewer greenhouse gases than railroads. Additionally, inland waterways contribute to reduced highway congestion and noise pollution. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the validity of these studies, citing concerns about technical factors not being taken into account. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species. Structural changes like locks, dams, and levees can alter natural flows, increase turbidity, and cause bank erosion. They argue for a more accurate comparison of fuel efficiency between barge and rail shipping, noting that industry studies may not consider technical factors like circuity. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways could have adverse environmental effects. Congress may need to consider changes in addition to deciding on further investment. The construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances these investments, including proposals for additional revenue such as an increase to the fuel tax or new annual fees. The IWUB argues that increasing the fuel tax would rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups find the associated increases in federal cost share responsibilities unacceptable. The user industry's stance on accepting fuel tax increases without changes to cost-sharing is unclear. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The fees would include fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even more. The Administration also suggested adding new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list. Commercial shippers are seen as the primary beneficiaries of waterway investments and should continue to pay for new capital investments, with lock users paying the most. Previous proposals for lock usage fees have been rejected by the IWUB and Congress as unfair burdens on waterway users. The IWUB and Congress have opposed the new Administration proposal for user fees on the inland waterway system, arguing that it unfairly burdens waterway users. They believe that targeting individual segments goes against the interconnected nature of the waterways. The user industry is concerned about the significant impact of fee increases on shippers. Additionally, they are against the proposal delegating fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Previous revenue-raising options, such as lock usage fees and other fees, have been considered by Congress. Annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges are potential revenue-raising options for inland waterways. The concept of \"capital recovery\" involves user fees adjusting to recover government capital investments, potentially reducing future trust fund shortfalls. The Obama Administration proposal suggests tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Critics argue that capital recovery makes it difficult to plan for constantly changing taxes. The proposal suggests tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Users have concerns about capital recovery, as it could lead to cost increases and a shrinking user base. Congress may need to find additional ways to increase revenue for inland waterways, such as an automatic inflation adjustment in fuel taxes or lockage fees. Failure to address the revenue shortfall could force Congress to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency in the future. To ensure the solvency of the trust fund, Congress is considering options such as capping IWTF withdrawals at current year fuel tax revenues or exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements. There is a debate on whether the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is balanced, as established by WRDA 1986 and later modified by WRDA 1992. The IWUB proposal aims to redefine cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. It suggests a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation, increasing the number of federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposal suggests shifting the cost-sharing arrangement for inland waterway projects towards the federal government, with a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation. Critics argue that making cost overruns a 100% federal responsibility would add hidden costs to the government. The proposed changes would increase federal funding for IWTF construction projects from 50/50 to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal, leading to a shift in the cost burden. Groups note that the IWTF already receives significant federal support, with federal funding covering 100% of investigations and operations and maintenance. This support amounts to $500 million-$650 million annually, with federal costs for inland waterways potentially rising to over 90% under the proposal. The Obama Administration's proposals have suggested changes to user fees but maintain a 50/50 cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures. Some argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government. The IWTF system currently has a 50/50 cost-share structure funded by the General Revenue fund. Some groups advocate for waterway users to take on more financial responsibility, including covering construction, major rehabilitation, and operations and maintenance costs. These proposals, previously rejected by Congress, may be reconsidered amidst government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has requested Congress to implement reforms to improve project prioritization and reduce cost overruns. Industry users argue that reforms are needed to decrease cost overruns in IWTF projects. A study by the Corps identified factors contributing to overruns, including inaccurate schedules and costs. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise with non-federal entity involvement in decision-making. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system for inland waterway projects to improve decision-making processes. The IWUB report recommends a priority ranking system for inland waterway projects, potentially changing Congress's role in project selection and funding. If implemented as a regulation, the Corps would use these criteria for project selection, limiting Congress to providing authorizations and funding levels. This shift aligns with federal practices in allocating project funds for other agency programs."
