The Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD) algorithm encourages agents to develop unique policies while solving tasks, leading to improved performance and diverse behaviors. Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves learning through interaction with the environment to maximize rewards, inspired by animal studies and cognition. Biodiversity and skill development are essential for evolution and continuation. In reinforcement learning, promoting behavioral diversity is crucial for the evolution of species. Two approaches include designing rich environments for agents to learn various skills and motivating agents to explore beyond just maximizing rewards. Previous works have focused on increasing policy differentiation to enhance the diversity of RL agents while maintaining their performance. In this work, the focus is on policy differentiation in reinforcement learning to enhance agent diversity while maintaining task-solving abilities. Inspired by social influence in animal societies, the concept is applied to RL. The learning scheme involves agents differentiating actions to be unique from others, implemented as social uniqueness motivation. A policy distance metric is defined to compare agent similarity, and an optimization constraint is developed for immediate feedback in the learning process. The proposed method, Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), introduces a constraint to motivate agents to perform well in tasks while taking different actions from other agents. This approach aims to enhance agent diversity in reinforcement learning. Additionally, the Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME) method is utilized to address sparse reward problems by adding an intrinsic reward term to encourage exploration. In VIME, intrinsic rewards based on information gains are added to RL algorithms to promote exploration. Various methods like Random Network Distillation and Competitive Experience Replay define intrinsic rewards differently to encourage learning from prediction errors and state coincidence. These approaches combine external rewards from environments with intrinsic rewards from heuristics to tackle sparse reward problems in reinforcement learning. The Task-Novelty Bisector (TNB) learning method aims to optimize both external and intrinsic rewards by updating the policy in the direction of the angular bisector of the two gradients. However, this joint optimization approach requires additional computation expenses. On the other hand, Heess et al. introduce the Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO) method to enable agents to learn complex skills in diverse environments using straightforward learning rewards. The research explores how agents with simulated bodies can learn complex locomotion skills in challenging environments. Different RL algorithms may converge to different policies for the same task, with policy gradient algorithms tending to converge to the same local optimum while off-policy and value-based algorithms learn sophisticated strategies. The focus is on learning different policies through a single algorithm and avoiding local optima. Kurutach et al. maintain model uncertainty using deep neural networks to encourage behavioral diversity in RL. The research focuses on maintaining model uncertainty in reinforcement learning to encourage behavioral diversity. A metric is defined to measure the difference between policies, using the Total Variance Divergence to calculate the distance between policies in a metric space. This approach aims to avoid local optima and promote the emergence of diverse behaviors in RL. The Total Variance Divergence metric is used to measure policy differences in reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize the uniqueness of new policies. Monte Carlo estimation is used for calculating the metric, with challenges in obtaining sufficient samples in continuous state spaces. To improve sample efficiency, an approximation method is proposed. The Total Variance Divergence metric is utilized to measure policy discrepancies in reinforcement learning, with a focus on enhancing the uniqueness of new policies. An approximation method is suggested to improve sample efficiency by dividing the domain of possible states and ensuring similarity between different policies. By adding noise on \u03b8 and enabling sufficient exploration in training, the last term related to the domain S \u03b8 can be eliminated. The learning algorithm in reinforcement learning aims to maximize the expectation of cumulative rewards by considering both the reward from the primal task and policy uniqueness. Previous approaches have combined these rewards in a weighted sum to enhance behavioral diversity among agents. The learning algorithm in reinforcement learning aims to maximize cumulative rewards by considering both the reward from the primal task and intrinsic reward. The selection of weight parameter \u03b1 and formulation of intrinsic reward r int are crucial. To address this, the objective is transformed into a constrained optimization problem, with social uniqueness acting as a constraint rather than an additional target. This approach helps balance the contribution of intrinsic reward without undermining the primal task. The text discusses the use of penalty methods and Interior Point Methods in solving constrained optimization problems in reinforcement learning. The selection of parameters like \u03b1 and intrinsic reward r int is crucial for optimization. The approach aims to balance intrinsic reward contribution without compromising the primary task. In the proposed RL paradigm, the learning process is influenced by peers, allowing for a more natural way to handle computationally challenging and numerically unstable situations. By bounding collected transitions within a feasible region using previously trained policies, new agents are terminated if they step outside it. This ensures that all valid samples collected during training are unique, eliminating the need to deliberate between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The proposed Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD) method aims to address the trade-off between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning. By formulating a constrained optimization problem inspired by IPMs, the method ensures a more robust learning process without objective inconsistency. Demonstrated on the MuJoCo environment, the method generates unique policies in locomotion environments like Hopper-v3, Walker2d-v3, and HalfCheetah-v3. Experiments show that behavior diversity can be improved by leveraging the stochasticity in training processes.

Demonstrated on the MuJoCo environment, the method generates unique policies in locomotion environments. Behavior diversity can be improved by leveraging the stochasticity in training processes. The method is compared with TNB and weighted sum reward approaches in terms of combining task goals and uniqueness motivation. More implementation details are provided in Appendix D. The proposed Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD) method ensures a robust learning process by generating unique policies in locomotion environments. The method outperforms other approaches in terms of uniqueness and performance in Hopper and HalfCheetah environments. In Walker2d, both WSR and IPD improve policy uniqueness, but none of the methods excel in performance. Our proposed Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD) method outperforms other approaches in terms of uniqueness and performance in locomotion environments. In Walker2d, both WSR and IPD improve policy uniqueness, but none of the methods excel in performance compared to PPO. Detailed comparisons on task-related rewards and success rates are provided in Table 1, Fig.5, Fig.6, and Fig.7 in Appendix C. Success rate is used to evaluate if a policy learns unique behavior without sacrificing performance. Our proposed Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD) method shows superior performance in locomotion environments compared to other methods. The success rate of our method consistently surpasses the average baseline during training, leading to noticeable performance improvements in the Hopper and HalfCheetah environments. Our method prevents policies from getting stuck in the same local minimum, encouraging exploration of different action patterns and ultimately enhancing performance in a traditional RL scheme. The HalfCheetah environment lacks explicit termination signals, leading to initial random actions and high control costs. Our learning scheme incorporates peer interactions to provide termination signals, guiding the agent to imitate previous policies and then explore for higher rewards. This implicit curriculum enhances performance by encouraging efficient behavior and exploration. Our approach introduces social influence to guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents in learning diverse strategies. By defining policy uniqueness and using Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), we enable RL to explore different policies efficiently. The performance decrease under social influence is more pronounced in the Hopper environment due to its limited action space. Our method draws insights from Interior Point Methods to address this challenge. Our proposed method, Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), leverages Interior Point Methods to address constrained optimization problems in reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that IPD can help agents learn diverse policies, avoid local minima, and facilitate implicit curriculum learning. Comparison with other methods like TNB and WSR reveals trade-offs between uniqueness and task-related performance, requiring careful hyper-parameter tuning and reward shaping. The calculation of Total Variation Distance (D_TV) involves removing Gaussian noise from policies and utilizing deterministic parts for optimization. In the implementation details, deterministic policies are used for calculating D_TV, with MLP actor models having 2 hidden layers. Different unit numbers are tested for the second layer, with 10, 64, and 256 units chosen based on success rate, performance, and computation expense. Training timesteps are fixed for each task, and the threshold selection in the proposed method allows for control over policy uniqueness. Choosing different thresholds will lead to different policy behaviors. A larger threshold may drive the agent to perform more differently while a smaller threshold imposes a lighter constraint. We use cumulative uniqueness as constraints instead of forcing every single action to be different. The constraints can be applied after the first timesteps. Performance of agents under different thresholds is shown in Fig. 9 and detailed analysis in Table 2. The constraints of cumulative uniqueness can be applied after the first timesteps. Different methods like WSR, TNB, and IPD correspond to approaches in constrained optimization. The Penalty Method solves the unconstrained problem iteratively by incorporating constraints into a penalty term. The selection of a fixed weight term \u03b1 in WSR heavily influences the final solution. The Taylor series approximation of g(\u03b8) is used in the optimization process. The final solution heavily relies on the selection of \u03b1 in the optimization process. The TNB method selects a direction based on the bisector of gradients. The barrier term of \u2212\u03b1 log g(\u03b8) can also be used, where \u03b1 is a small positive number. As \u03b1 decreases, the solution with the barrier term gets closer to the primal objective. The TNB method selects a direction based on the bisector of gradients, with the barrier term of \u2212\u03b1 log g(\u03b8) where \u03b1 is a small positive number. As \u03b1 decreases, the solution with the barrier term gets closer to the primal objective. To address computational challenges, a more natural approach is used by bounding collected transitions within the feasible region using previously trained policies. This ensures that all valid samples collected during training are inside the feasible region, leading to a new policy with sufficient uniqueness without the need to consider trade-offs between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. At the end of training, a new policy is obtained with sufficient uniqueness, eliminating the need to deliberate on trade-offs between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The learning process becomes more robust and no longer suffers from objective inconsistency. The pseudo code of IPD based on PPO is shown in Algorithm.1, with additions highlighted in blue."
