    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the Supreme Court's order to reduce California's prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by 2013. Despite efforts like the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, the prison population remained at 140% of capacity in 2014, exceeding the final cap by 2,104 inmates. This realignment shifted responsibility for lower-level offenders to counties, diverting over 100,000 offenders from state prisons to county supervision by mid-2013. On November 4, 2014, California voters passed Proposition 47, requiring misdemeanor sentencing for certain crimes and allowing inmates to petition for resentencing. By December 4, 2014, 132 inmates had been released due to resentencing. It is estimated that the prison population will decrease by 1,900 inmates in 2015-16 due to resentencing and reduced new admissions. Investing in workforce training and support for formerly incarcerated individuals is crucial for their successful reentry into society. Research shows that access to quality jobs and education reduces repeat offenses and lowers the number of people incarcerated. California's Strategic Workforce Development Plan prioritizes providing employment services for this population. The State Workforce Investment Board will administer the grant program according to Penal Code Section 1234.2. The State Workforce Investment Board will administer the grant program by developing criteria for selection, providing outreach and technical assistance to small and rural counties, awarding grants competitively, and addressing the education and training needs of individuals with postsecondary education. Individuals with postsecondary education can benefit from programs leading to certifications and career advancement. The grant program under Section 1234.3 of the Penal Code will be competitively awarded to counties, with partnerships required between counties and local workforce boards. The grant program under Section 1234.3 of the Penal Code requires education and training assessments for supervised individuals. Grant funds can be used for vocational training, stipends, and apprenticeships. Preference is given to applications with matching funds from local workforce boards, governments, and private foundations. An application for grant funds must have matching funds from local workforce boards, governments, or private foundations. It should also involve nonprofit organizations serving the supervised population and define the purpose, target population, and industry sectors for training. Grant recipients must provide detailed information to the State Workforce Investment Board for reporting purposes. They are required to report annually and at the end of the grant period on fund usage and program outcomes. The State WIB will then submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018, evaluating the success and effectiveness of the grant program and making recommendations for future workforce training collaborations. The report will evaluate the success of grant programs for workforce training collaborations and make recommendations on the long-term viability of county programs. It will discuss the education and workforce readiness of participants, alignment with high-demand sectors, job market availability, and the increase in certifications obtained. The report evaluates the success of grant programs for workforce training collaborations, focusing on increasing certifications, job readiness, employment in livable wage occupations, and alignment of metrics with program objectives. The requirement for submitting a report is inoperative after January 1, 2021. The report evaluating grant programs for workforce training collaborations must be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code. This act is an urgency statute for immediate cost savings to the state by improving the grant program efficiency."
