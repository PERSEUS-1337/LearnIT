    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Recreational fishing is popular with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting 1.2 million jobs. Anglers also contribute over $500 million to conservation programs. Recreational anglers contribute over $500 million annually to State fisheries conservation programs. Federal policy supports public access to public lands for recreational purposes while maintaining conservation principles. Recreational fishery resources can be managed without restricting public access through various measures. A clear policy is needed to show anglers that recreational fishing can be managed effectively. A clear policy is required for the implementation and monitoring of marine protected areas to balance recreational fishing and sustain fishery resources effectively. The United States policy aims to conserve fishery resources by ensuring access for recreational anglers and involving them in regulatory procedures. Limitations on access are only imposed if scientifically necessary for conservation. Amendments are made to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Act limit closures for recreational fishing to specific conservation problems, requiring measurable criteria and periodic reviews based on scientific information. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Act require periodic reviews based on scientific information to support the need for closing areas to recreational fishing. Technical amendments include adjustments to paragraphs (13) and (14) for clarity. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act is being amended. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act is being amended to update fishing regulations within the exclusive economic zone, allowing Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft and revise regulations as needed. These regulations must align with the Magnuson Act standards and may extend to fisheries within a state with approval from the Governor or determination by the Secretary. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a state if the Governor approves or if the Secretary determines that the state's actions will negatively impact the goals of the Act. The state and Council must be notified, and a hearing can be requested by the state. If the Secretary assumes regulation of a fishery within a state, the state can request a hearing and may later apply for reinstatement of authority if the reasons for regulation no longer exist. The Secretary may terminate a regulation if the reasons for assuming it no longer exist."
