Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and in some cases, have law enforcement authority. This report lists the statutes and regulations that grant OIGs law enforcement authority and provides resources to support their need for such authority. Federal inspectors general (IGs) have substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. Offices of inspector general (OIGs) are vested with law enforcement authority, which is unique to each federal agency based on its mission. OIGs may release public statements detailing their need for law enforcement authority, as seen in the example of the Social Security Administration's OIG explaining an ammunition purchase for agent safety during training sessions. The USDA's OIG procured new semi-automatic firearms to replace automatic firearms for agent safety. OIG investigations have resulted in over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and $460 million in monetary results from fiscal year 2012 to March 2014. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms for criminal investigations. The USDA's OIG Investigations division conducts criminal investigations involving OIG agents, USDA employees, and the public facing life-threatening situations. OIG special agents conduct undercover operations and surveillance for various criminal activities. OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority through explicit provisions in the IG Act. The OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority through explicit provisions in the IG Act of 1978, as authorized by the Attorney General. This authority can also be delegated to OIGs in certain federal entities to ensure proper exercise of such powers. The IG Act of 1978 authorizes certain federal entities to vest their OIGs with law enforcement authority. Guidelines issued by the Attorney General, such as those promulgated by John Ashcroft in 2003, outline the scope and limitations of this authority. OIG employees with law enforcement powers must undergo specific training, including firearms training, and adhere to the Department of Justice's deadly force policy. OIGs with law enforcement authority must follow DOJ policies, receive training in various legal processes, and consult with DOJ before using surveillance or starting undercover investigations. Five OIGs have law enforcement authority outside the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms in 2008, with no reported assaults or injuries."
