    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicaid Foster Care Coverage Act of 2007\" establishes independent foster care adolescents as a mandatory category for Medicaid coverage. The Medicaid Foster Care Coverage Act of 2007 establishes independent foster care adolescents as a mandatory category for Medicaid coverage, with specific amendments made to the Social Security Act to include them. The Social Security Act is amended to change specific subsections related to Medicaid coverage for independent foster care adolescents. The Social Security Act is amended to update various subsections related to Medicaid coverage, specifically changing references from \"1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX)\" to \"1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII)\" and \"1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVII)\" in different sections. The Social Security Act is amended to update references from \"1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII)\" to \"1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVII)\" in various sections, with amendments effective from October 1, 2007. State plans requiring legislation to meet the new requirements are exempt from non-compliance solely based on this reason. The State plan is not considered failing to comply with the requirements of the Social Security Act solely because it does not meet the additional requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's regular session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is treated as a separate regular session."
