    "content": "The Act titled \"No Funds for Cyber Coordination with Russia Act of 2017\" includes sections on short title, definitions, purpose, findings, funding prohibition, sense of Congress, and termination. The Act defines key terms in Section 2. The Act defines key terms such as \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"cybersecurity,\" and \"cybersecurity unit.\" The Act defines terms like \"cybersecurity unit\" as an organization for cybersecurity, \"cyberspace\" as the global information network, and \"significant activities undermining cybersecurity\" as efforts to disrupt or steal information without authorization. The Act prohibits unauthorized access to systems for conducting influence operations, causing misappropriation of funds or information for gain, destructive malware attacks, and denial of service activities. The Act aims to protect US cybersecurity and critical infrastructure by preventing the President from establishing a cybersecurity unit with the Russian Federation, a known foreign adversary. Congress finds that the Russian government, under President Putin's orders, conducted an influence campaign in the 2016 US presidential election to undermine public faith in the democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and support President-elect Trump. President Obama issued Executive Order 13757 on December 29, 2016, expanding sanctions authority against individuals and entities involved in malicious cyber activities. This order amended Executive Order 13694 to address significant cyber threats to national security and economic stability. The Government of the Russian Federation has been involved in cyber-attacks against United States agencies, including the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the White House. Russian Federal Security Service officers were charged for hacking Yahoo and email accounts of US citizens. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted Russia's influence activities in the 2016 election as a significant disruption. The Russian Federation has been actively involved in cyber-attacks against US agencies since the 1960s, with former FBI Director James Comey testifying about their efforts to shape American thinking and undermine credibility. This poses a significant threat to the democratic political system. President Donald Trump strongly confronted President Putin about Russian meddling in the US election, but later proposed working with Russia on cybersecurity. This comes in the context of ongoing Russian cyber-attacks against US agencies, posing a threat to the democratic political system. The bill prohibits the use of federal funds to establish a cybersecurity unit with Russia. Congress believes the President should acknowledge Russian interference in the 2016 election and not engage in cyber coordination with Russia. It suggests creating an independent commission to investigate Russian cyber operations. SEC. 7. TERMINATION. The prohibitions under this Act will end when the President certifies that Russia has stopped undermining democracies worldwide and acknowledges interference in the 2016 US election."
