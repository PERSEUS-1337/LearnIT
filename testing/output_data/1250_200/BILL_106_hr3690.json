    "content": "The Act titled \"HMO Solvency Act of 2000\" aims to ensure the financial stability of Medicaid managed care organizations. The HMO Solvency Act of 2000 amends the Medicaid Program to require medicaid managed care organizations to submit financial reports regularly to the State for monitoring solvency and risk of insolvency. The State must review the reports and take appropriate action. The Medicaid managed care organization must undergo an on-site audit by an independent entity to evaluate its internal structure and financial projections. The audit will focus on claims processing, utilization management, accounting functions, and key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, pricing, reserves, and information system integrity. Each Medicaid managed care organization must maintain a minimum net worth in cash or cash equivalents as specified by the State, approved by the Secretary, and undergo periodic audits as required by the State audit plan. The State may allow the minimum net worth requirement for Medicaid managed care organizations to be met through a written guarantee by a guarantor specified by the State. Organizations must notify the State at least 90 days before entering into a subcontract for healthcare services. The Medicaid managed care organization must provide an independent audit of proposed subcontractors before the subcontract takes effect. They also need to report significant changes in ownership or scope of operations to the State to ensure continuing solvency. The State must ensure the ongoing solvency of Medicaid managed care organizations by requiring compliance with federal solvency standards and applying certain requirements to controlling organizations. The effective date for these changes is within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may delay the effective date of Medicaid managed care organizations to meet additional requirements imposed by the amendment. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. The solvency of Medicare+Choice organizations is ensured through the application of specific requirements, similar to those for medicaid managed care organizations. State enforcement is recognized, and organizations meeting the requirements are deemed compliant. The Secretary will waive requirements for organizations if they are deemed comparable and not duplicative. The amendment applies to organizations providing Medicare benefits on a capitated basis. Effective implementation will be similar to existing procedures. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be implemented in a similar manner to section 2(a), with subsection (b) also being implemented accordingly. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must report to Congress within a year on steps taken by states to protect health care providers in case of insolvency of medicaid managed care organizations or Medicare+Choice organizations, and recommend additional measures for provider protection."
