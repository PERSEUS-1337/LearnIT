    "content": "Agricultural conservation became a significant policy focus in the Food Security Act of 1985 and has been a recurring issue in subsequent farm bills. The 2008 farm bill continued to address concerns about funding, policy objectives, program effectiveness, and federal assistance structure. Conservation programs are well represented by small and mid-size farming operations and enjoy wider public support, but face competition for resources in a budget-constrained environment. In the debate leading to the 2008 farm bill, groups and producers faced competition for resources to expand conservation programs. Key issues included funding priorities, payment structure, program complexity, and measurement of costs and effectiveness. Questions arose about payment limits, program participation patterns, savings allocation, and funding levels' impact on program backlog. Agricultural production concentration in specific U.S. regions also influenced conservation policy. The existing backlog of interest in program participation that cannot be met is influenced by the concentration of agricultural production in specific regions of the United States. Environmental impact from agricultural activities varies across different areas and natural resources. Questions arise about where federal conservation spending would be most effective, whether certain locations or producer groups should be targeted, and if some types of agricultural production or resource concerns should receive higher priority. Members of Congress, conservation groups, the Administration, and individual producers have raised concerns about the proliferation of conservation programs. In evaluating applications, concerns have been raised about the complexity and duplication of agricultural conservation programs. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of program delivery and whether existing programs could be combined to reduce complexity. Additionally, there is a discussion on whether USDA agencies need to enhance their conservation delivery capacity through partnerships or expanding the technical assistance provider system. Local planning and implementation of conservation programs through locally constituted councils is crucial for conservation management in the U.S. However, there is a debate on whether conservation efforts would be more effective at larger scales, such as regional or multistate planning. Concerns have been raised about declining participation in voluntary conservation programs if they are perceived as being too remote from local input. Using watersheds or river basin drainage areas as policy targets is suggested for more efficient program delivery and effectiveness. Participation in conservation programs may decrease if producers feel disconnected from local planning input. Utilizing larger scales like watersheds or river basins for policy targets could enhance efficiency by pooling resources. Evaluation of federal conservation programs is crucial for effective management, but developing practical indicators remains a challenge. Stakeholders generally agree on the effectiveness of conservation measures in reducing environmental impacts, but questions remain about costs, locations, and specific circumstances. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes and modifies conservation programs administered by USDA, including land retirement and easement programs and \"working lands\" programs. Land retirement programs take land out of crop production for longer-term conservation coverage, while working lands programs provide assistance to improve natural resource conservation. The 2008 farm bill introduces new conservation programs, including land retirement and easement programs like CRP, WRP, GRP, and FPP. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows producers to enter contracts for conservation practices on environmentally sensitive acreage. It aims to improve soil, water, and wildlife resources through vegetative cover. Administered by USDA, CRP is the largest conservation program in terms of funding. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a major conservation program administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) and funded through the Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). It aims to protect environmentally sensitive land, decrease erosion, restore wildlife habitat, and safeguard water resources. The 2008 farm bill caps CRP enrollment at 32 million acres and encourages producers to transition from land retirement to working lands conservation. The farm bill makes program changes for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), including addressing conservation initiatives at different levels, providing incentives for new farmers to purchase CRP land, allowing managed haying and grazing, and establishing cost-sharing rates for conservation structures. Additionally, the bill expands the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres in CRP, allowing each state to enroll up to 100,000 acres with a national maximum of one million acres. Eligible lands include cropped wetlands and areas for developing constructed wetlands. The farm bill allows managed harvesting and grazing on CRP acreage in response to drought and routine grazing for invasive species control. Wind turbine installation on enrolled land is now permitted. Any permitted use will result in a rental payment reduction. Cost-share payments are authorized for hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors. Funding of $100 million is authorized for tree thinning. The 2008 farm bill modifies criteria for evaluating CRP contract applications, including improving soil resources, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Preference in new CRP contracts is given to local landowners and operators. Incentives are provided for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers. $25 million is authorized for assistance in land transfers. Other modifications include redefining the Chesapeake. The 2008 farm bill authorizes $25 million for assistance in land transfers for retired or retiring farm owners. The bill also includes modifications to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), expanding funding priority to watersheds draining into the Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, the bill allows retired or disabled farmers to exclude CRP payments from self-employment taxes starting in January 2008. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) provides long-term assistance to landowners for wetland protection and wildlife practices. The bill increases the WRP maximum enrollment cap to over 3.014 million acres. The 2008 farm bill increases the WRP maximum enrollment cap to over 3.014 million acres, expands eligible lands to include private and tribal wetlands, croplands, and grasslands, and authorizes a new Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program. The bill also makes program changes, including a new acreage enrollment goal and modifications to the payment schedule for easements. Additionally, the bill establishes the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) to help landowners restore and protect grassland, rangeland, pastureland, and shrubland. The 2008 farm bill establishes the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) to protect various types of land and sets an acreage enrollment goal by 2012. The program offers funds for rental contracts and permanent easements, allowing for fire presuppression and grazing-related activities. Priority is given to certain expiring CRP lands and tribal lands are eligible for enrollment. The bill does not include a Grassland Reserve Enhancement provision as proposed in the House. The 2008 farm bill changes the conservation program's focus to protecting agricultural land, with USDA providing up to 50% of the fair market easement value. The federal share of easement costs is capped at 50%, with landowners contributing 25%. The program emphasizes longer-term cooperative agreements and makes technical changes to administrative requirements and appraisal methodology. Additional budget authority of $743 million is provided for the program. The 2008 farm bill provides additional budget authority of $743 million for major working lands programs, including EQIP, CSP, AMA, and WHIP. EQIP and CSP are the two largest programs, receiving $3.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, over five years. EQIP, administered by USDA's NRCS, offers technical and cost-share assistance to farmers for promoting agricultural production and environmental quality through various subprograms. The 2008 farm bill expands the Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program to cover various land and natural resources, providing assistance to beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, tribal members, and producers transitioning to organic production. It sets payment limits and prioritizes cost-effectiveness and comprehensive treatment of resource issues. The enacted 2008 farm bill retains the requirement that 60% of funds be made available for cost-sharing to livestock producers, with an emphasis on developing comprehensive nutrient management plans. It reserves $37.5 million of annual EQIP funds for the Conservation Innovation Grants program, covering air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions. The bill also introduces the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) to address water quality and quantity issues on agricultural land, prioritizing assistance to areas experiencing significant drought. Priority areas under the programs include the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer region, Puget Sound, the Ogallala Aquifer, the Sacramento River watershed, the Upper Mississippi River Basin, the Red River of the North Basin, and the Everglades. The 2008 farm bill introduces the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) to address water quality and quantity issues on agricultural land, prioritizing assistance to areas experiencing significant drought. Funding for EQIP is authorized at $1.2 billion (FY2008) to $1.75 billion (FY2012). The bill phases out the Conservation Security Program and replaces it with the new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) in 2009, which encourages conservation practices on working lands with 5-year contracts and other changes. The 2008 farm bill introduces the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) to replace the Conservation Security Program, with 5-year contracts and new payment system based on stewardship thresholds. The CSP reserves funds for beginning farmers, disadvantaged farmers, and emphasizes monitoring and evaluation of stewardship plans for environmental effectiveness. The new CSP under the 2008 farm bill expands eligible lands to include priority resource concerns, private agricultural and forested lands, and nonindustrial private forest lands. Producers can receive payments up to $200,000 in a 5-year period, with continuous enrollment and technical assistance for specialty crop and organic producers. Supplemental payments are available for resource-conserving crop rotations that improve soil fertility. Program payments cannot be used for animal waste facilities. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) provides cost-share assistance for establishing and improving fish and wildlife habitat on private land. The program focuses on developing wildlife habitat on private agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and tribal lands. WHIP agreements typically last 5 to 10 years and prioritize projects that align with state, regional, and national conservation initiatives. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes WHIP at current funding levels but limits program eligibility to specific areas, potentially excluding non-agricultural lands. The 2008 farm bill provides funding for various wildlife initiatives at state and local levels, including the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The bill also increases cost-share payments to 25% for long-term projects and limits payments to $50,000 per year per entity. Additionally, it authorizes a $15 million increase in funding for the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and $100 million for the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The farm bill provides funding for various programs such as the Agricultural Management Assistance Program (AMA) and the Resource Conservation and Development Program (RC&D) to address water management, erosion control, and community development. The bill also reauthorizes the Farm Viability Program and includes Hawaii as an eligible state. The Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control is a federal-state partnership providing demonstration and technical assistance projects throughout the Great Lakes region. The program is coordinated by the Great Lakes Commission in partnership with the NRCS, the EPA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The enacted 2008 farm bill modifies the program to implement the recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, providing site-specific technical assistance for producers and landowners in constructing conservation technologies. The bill includes provisions for conservation practice standards, certification for third-party providers, an Agriculture Conservation Experienced Services Program, state TA committees, and a Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative targeting conservation priorities on agricultural and private forest land. The 2008 farm bill directs USDA to prepare statistical and evaluation reports on conservation programs, including annual reports on program enrollments and payments, prioritizing projects that provide innovative conservation methods. The bill also requires reports on the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program and the long-term implications of conservation easements. The 2008 farm bill requires reports on various conservation programs, including the Water Enhancement Program, conservation easements, county cash rental rates, and soil and water conservation programs. It also introduces new USDA conservation activities, such as expanding conservation in the Chesapeake Bay region and promoting market-based approaches to conservation. The bill authorizes funding for the Chesapeake Bay conservation program, prioritizing certain rivers and tributaries. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for the \"Open Fields\" program, which provides funding for public access to wildlife-dependent recreation on private lands. It also introduces a conservation provision to encourage participation in environmental services markets. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for emerging environmental services markets, such as water and air quality, habitat protection, and carbon storage. It directs USDA to establish standards for quantifying environmental services from agriculture and forestry sectors. Funding is available for resource management activities targeting sources of salinity in the Colorado River and for desert terminal lakes, including land and water purchases in the Walker River Basin. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for environmental services markets like water and air quality, habitat protection, and carbon storage. Funding is allocated for land and water purchases in the Walker River Basin. The bill establishes a loan program to assist producers with conservation installations, prioritizing beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, those transitioning to organic systems, and producers needing conservation assistance for compliance. Agriculture and farmland conservation groups support the bill, but some wildlife groups are concerned about changes that may reduce benefits for wildlife protection and habitat. Some wildlife groups are concerned about changes in the conference negotiations that could reduce benefits for wildlife protection and habitat, including the reduction in CRP acreage enrollment cap, easing of requirements under the \"sodsaver\" provision, limitations on eligible lands under the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and the new permanent disaster fund potentially encouraging marginal land plantings."
