    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution, with exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. Congress can authorize the military to execute the law in three ways. Congress has authorized the military to execute the law in three ways: by giving armed forces civilian law enforcement authority, establishing general rules for assistance, and addressing individual cases with specific legislation. This includes granting the Coast Guard broad law enforcement responsibilities, passing statutes allowing the President to call out the armed forces during insurrection, and authorizing the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies. The military is authorized to provide assistance to civilian law enforcement agencies through sharing information and equipment, training police officers, and maintaining equipment. This authority is subject to certain limitations to ensure it does not undermine the military's capabilities. The military can provide assistance to civilian law enforcement agencies, but regulations must prevent the armed forces from being used solely for civilian law enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit the military from assisting civilian law enforcement as long as the primary purpose is military. The act only prohibits \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force. The Posse Comitatus Act limits the use of the Army or Air Force to \"willful\" violations, with courts likely requiring deliberate disregard of the law. Violations occur when military forces perform tasks typically handled by civilian government or solely for civilian government purposes, often arising when assisting civilian police. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement purposes. Courts use tests developed from the 1973 Wounded Knee incident to determine violations. The Act does not apply to Navy or Marine Corps, but they are subject to similar restrictions in DOD instructions. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement purposes, but does not apply to the Navy or Marine Corps. The Coast Guard, as part of the armed forces, is subject to different rules depending on its affiliation with the Department of Homeland Security or the Navy. While part of the Navy, the Coast Guard is authorized to perform law enforcement functions, exempting it from posse comitatus restrictions. The Posse Comitatus Act applies restrictions on the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement activities, with exceptions for certain enforcement activities. The Act is unclear on what constitutes \"part\" of the Army or Air Force, leading to questions about the coverage of entities like the National Guard and Civil Air Patrol. The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force when in federal service, and historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service.

The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force when in federal service, and historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. The Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" aims to prevent troops from executing the law as citizens rather than soldiers. The National Guard is subject to the Act only when in federal service, as confirmed by court rulings. The Posse Comitatus Act applies restrictions on the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement activities, with exceptions for certain enforcement activities. Recent debates have focused on whether the act applies to soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement while off duty. The Act's coverage includes civilian employees under the direct command of a military officer. There is uncertainty about the extraterritorial application of the Act. The Posse Comitatus Act, a criminal statute, applies restrictions on military involvement in civilian law enforcement within the United States and its territories. It has been invoked in various legal challenges and prosecutions, with limited success in enforcing its provisions. The Posse Comitatus Act is often invoked in legal challenges to exclude evidence or testimony related to military involvement in civilian law enforcement. While some defendants have successfully used the act to prevent convictions, courts have generally not dismissed prosecutions based on alleged violations of the act. The Posse Comitatus Act is often cited in legal challenges to military involvement in civilian law enforcement, but courts have not typically dismissed prosecutions on this basis. Violations of the act may lead to Fourth Amendment claims, but also provide a defense under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Plaintiffs face challenges in holding state or local law enforcement officers accountable for violations, often due to qualified immunity. Compliance by the armed forces is the most significant impact of the Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act has a significant impact on the armed forces, as they have a long-standing practice of avoiding involvement in civilian affairs to comply with the act. Military acceptance of civilian authority dates back to the founding of the Republic."
