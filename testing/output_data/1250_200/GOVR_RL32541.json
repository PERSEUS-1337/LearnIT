    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including lax screening, lack of in-flight security measures, and a failure of imagination among policymakers. The 9/11 Commission found that aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of suicide hijackings before September 11, 2001. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on passenger service rather than terrorism. After 9/11, Congress quickly passed the Aviation and Transportation Act. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address aviation security vulnerabilities. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all transportation modes, with measures such as federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 further enhanced security measures. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also authorized arming airline pilots for aircraft protection. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act included measures like an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and arming pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite these actions, vulnerabilities in aviation security remain, including air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. Recommendations were made for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security, but no specific recommendations were given for access controls and shoulder-fired missile threats. The 9/11 Commission recommended a multi-layered security system for aviation, focusing on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation. Six aviation-specific recommendations were identified, including enhancing passenger pre-screening and improving detection measures. The 9/11 Commission's final report identified six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, expediting baggage screening systems, intensifying efforts to screen dangerous cargo, and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. The CAPPS system, used by airlines for security screening, has evolved to identify possible hijackers based on passenger behaviors. CAPPS II, a controversial follow-up, aims to authenticate passenger identities and check them against terrorist watch lists. The CAPPS II system aims to authenticate passenger identities and check them against terrorist watch lists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improved pre-screening capabilities using federal government watchlists, but implementation has been limited due to concerns and reluctance from airlines to provide data for testing. The CAPPS II program has faced challenges with airlines reluctant to provide data for testing due to liability concerns. Recent reports suggest the program has been scrapped over privacy issues, but a new program may replace it. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program, with H.R. 10 proposing TSA takeover of prescreening within 180 days. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing the Bojinka plot and incidents involving IEDs like Richard Reid's shoe bomb attempt and Nathaniel Heatwole sneaking banned items aboard jets. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers and recommended improving screening technologies. New trace detection methods are being tested at various airport sites to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving screening technologies for detecting explosives on passengers at airports. Possible methods include body scan imaging, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches. Congress may debate funding for effective passenger screening initiatives. The TSA was advised to conduct a human factors study to enhance screener performance at checkpoints. The TSA has launched initiatives to address poor screener performance at screening checkpoints, including expanding the use of threat image projection (TIP) to test on-the-job performance. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. Research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities are limited compared to other agencies like the Department of Defense and FAA. Research on aviation security human factors and funding is lacking compared to other agencies like the Department of Defense and FAA. There is a need for a comprehensive strategic plan to address human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts are lacking. Consideration may be given to tasking the National Academy of Sciences to examine human factors needs in aviation security. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and examine next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for integrating baggage screening systems, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of the authorized $500 million annually. It may take several years to complete integration given the estimated cost of over $4 billion, with TSA using Letters of Intent (LOIs) to stretch limited federal funding for EDS integration at passenger airports. The TSA has implemented LOIs to reimburse airports for expenses incurred in integrating EDS systems, which could slow down progress. The aviation industry is expected to contribute to the costs of in-line EDS deployment, with airlines and passengers already paying the first $250 million annually. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share of costs to 25% at large and medium-sized airports and 10% at small airports, a move opposed by airports. The 9/11 Commission recommended a more equitable contribution from the aviation industry towards airport security costs. Legislation proposed increasing the TSA's flexibility for baggage screening requirements and doubling the amount collected in aviation security fees for the aviation security capital fund. Congress debated the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration, with a proposal to limit federal share for airport security projects. H.R. 5121 aims to enhance TSA's flexibility for baggage screening by allowing multi-year contracts with airports or vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. TSA's strategic plan for cargo security includes risk-based approaches like pre-screening, technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. TSA's strategic plan for cargo security includes pre-screening all shipments, inspecting elevated risk items, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing enhanced security measures. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches to air cargo security. Recent debate has focused on the level of physical screening needed to mitigate risks posed by cargo on passenger aircraft. The debate in Congress over air cargo security focuses on the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. While some propose 100% screening, Congress supports a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to enhance cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo, estimated to cost $125 million for sufficient containers. The debate in Congress over air cargo security focuses on the need for hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. The 9/11 Commission estimated it would cost $125 million for sufficient containers, with opponents arguing for improved cargo identification and tracking instead. Proponents believe hardened containers provide an additional layer of defense, but potential vulnerabilities still exist without comprehensive risk assessments. The TSA requires cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo airplanes. There are concerns about adapting systems to allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. Congress debates the effectiveness of hardened cargo containers in preventing bombings and the implications of allowing suspicious cargo on passenger planes. H.R. 10 includes a provision on air cargo security. The TSA requires cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo airplanes, while there are concerns about allowing suspicious cargo on passenger planes even if secured in hardened containers. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant containers for passenger airliners, while S. 2845 does not have a similar provision. The 9/11 Commission recommended a risk-based approach for protecting transportation assets, with TSA tasked to select practical and cost-effective defenses and develop a plan with roles for federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders. The 9/11 Commission recommends assigning roles and missions for aviation security to various authorities and stakeholders. TSA should focus on developing a unified strategic plan for aviation security, with a risk-based multi-layered approach likely forming the core of future policy. Congress may consider formally tasking TSA with this responsibility. In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress may consider assigning the TSA to develop a national strategy for aviation security. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions handle the physical security of airport sites, while the TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening. The TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening at airports, while local jurisdictions handle physical security. Aviation security involves federal, state, local, and industry participation, but lacks a unified plan for assigning roles and missions effectively. Congress and the TSA may need to develop a national strategy for aviation security based on careful consideration of logistics and costs. In response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation, Congress and the TSA are urged to improve strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop transportation security plans, including aviation, to prioritize risks, choose cost-effective protection methods, and assign roles to authorities and stakeholders. Congress has been focusing on implementing the recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report. Since the release of the 9/11 Commission report, Congress has given considerable attention to the recommendations regarding transportation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation containing provisions pertaining to aviation security, including the Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 established a redress process for licensed aviation professionals. Vision 100, enacted in 2003, established a redress process for aviation professionals facing certification issues. It also required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones and modified security training requirements for airline crews. Additionally, it mandated a study on the effectiveness of aviation security measures. Vision 100, enacted in 2003, mandated a study on the effectiveness of the aviation security system, recommendations for improvement, and the creation of the Aviation Security Capital Fund. It authorized up to $500 million per year for aviation security projects and grants for airports to enhance security measures. Vision 100 set federal cost shares for airport improvement projects, established guidelines for Aviation Security Capital Fund allocation, required security programs for air charter operators, mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system, authorized the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program for cargo airline crew members, and introduced the \"Secure Flight\" prescreening system as an alternative to CAPPS II. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crewmembers and required regulations for the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. It also modified background check requirements for foreign pilots seeking training in the United States, transferring the duties from the Department of Justice to the DHS. Flight schools are now required to provide notification and identification information for individuals seeking training in smaller aircraft, with background checks needed before training can begin. The legislation also authorizes fee collections to cover the costs of these background checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans. This includes a threat matrix for aviation security and guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) mandates the TSA to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric authentication for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It allocates $20 million for biometric technology research and development and $1 million for a biometric technologies center of excellence. The act also requires the TSA to start testing an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005, and assume passenger prescreening responsibilities within 180 days of completing testing. Additionally, it mandates redress procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system, oversight board establishment, and safeguards implementation. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to establish oversight and safeguards for biometric authentication in airport access control systems. It also requires prescreening of international flights and screening against terrorist watch lists for individuals seeking FAA certificates or access to secure airport areas. Additionally, the act mandates reporting on privacy impacts of selectee and no-fly lists. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates oversight for biometric authentication in airport access control systems, prescreening of international flights, and reporting on privacy impacts of selectee and no-fly lists. It also directs the development and deployment of advanced airport checkpoint screening technologies, including a pilot program to test screening systems at multiple airports. Additionally, the act requires a human factors study to improve the job performance of airport screening personnel. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates oversight for biometric authentication in airport access control systems, prescreening of international flights, and reporting on privacy impacts of selectee and no-fly lists. It also directs the development and deployment of advanced airport checkpoint screening technologies, including a pilot program to test screening systems at multiple airports. Additionally, the act requires a human factors study to improve the job performance of airport screening personnel. The Aviation Security Improvement Act requires various actions to enhance airport security, such as training law enforcement officers in counterterrorism procedures, encouraging international agreements for air marshal deployment, expediting baggage screening equipment installation, and studying cost-sharing options for baggage screening systems. The Aviation Security Improvement Act mandates increased funding for baggage screening systems and requires the TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew security alerts. It also mandates tamper-resistant pilot licenses and sets standards for screener staffing levels at airports. The Aviation Security Improvement Act authorizes $100 million for research on improved explosive detection systems, prohibits certain carry-on items, and directs the President to pursue international treaties to limit the proliferation of shoulder-fired missiles. It also requires annual briefings on diplomatic efforts to address non-proliferation of these weapons. The Aviation Security Improvement Act requires annual briefings on diplomatic efforts to address MANPADS non-proliferation, expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, assessment of aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, establishment of a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers, funding for air cargo and airport security improvements, and a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology development. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 focus on air cargo security. They establish grant programs for advanced technology, require final rules for cargo security, and direct research on inspecting and screening air cargo on passenger aircraft. The DHS is also tasked with reporting on threats from international cargo shipments and establishing secure facilities along aviation routes for security purposes. During the 108th Congress, policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo security procedures were not adequately addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns over general aviation operations but did not make formal recommendations. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with a provision in Vision 100 requiring the development of a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 108th Congress did not adequately address general aviation security and air cargo security concerns. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with a provision for a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. However, comprehensive legislation on air cargo security operations and oversight was lacking. Concerns were raised about the risk posed by general aviation corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters following a joint assessment by the FBI and DHS. The 108th Congress did not address air cargo security concerns adequately. The Senate's measures in S. 165 were removed from the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The TSA was directed to create final proposed rules instead. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules to ensure they meet objectives."
