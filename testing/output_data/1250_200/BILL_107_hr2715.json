    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act.\" It includes findings related to the study. The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands per population. This deficiency hinders access to nature, leading to health and social benefits being compromised. Without action, the situation will worsen due to ongoing growth in the region. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys provides important scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, and economic assets to Southern California. It contains significant examples of endangered habitats and indigenous ecotones. The Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California includes the San Gabriel Mountains escarpment within the Angeles National Forest, managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values. Privately owned lands in the corridor offer additional scenic, environmental, and recreational benefits and should be protected through voluntary incentives. California has a Master Plan for the Rim of the Valley to preserve its unique natural and recreational resources. The Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California has made progress in protecting its natural and recreational resources, but lacks financial resources, technical assistance, and expertise from the Federal Government. The Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California is being studied for potential inclusion as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential inclusion in the National Park System and involve consultation with relevant advisory committees. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on studying and recommending boundaries for a expanded recreation area. The boundaries should reflect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and include the lands, waters, and interests of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Committee, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, is tasked with submitting a recommendation with maps depicting proposed boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area within 365 days. Public participation in and comment on the recommendation is encouraged. The curr_chunk describes the composition of a committee consisting of 17 representatives from local governments in the vicinity of the recreation area, each nominated by different city councils and boards of supervisors. The committee consists of representatives nominated by various local governments in the area, including city councils and boards of supervisors, as well as officials from national parks and recreation departments. The Committee consists of representatives nominated by local governments and officials from national parks and recreation departments. It includes members from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Conejo Recreation and Park District, and Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. The Committee selects a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members, who serve without compensation but are reimbursed for necessary expenses. A quorum of 13 members is required for business transactions, and the Committee will terminate upon the submission of a special resources study to Congress by the Secretary of the Interior."
