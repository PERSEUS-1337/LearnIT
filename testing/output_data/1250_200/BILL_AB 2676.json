    "content": "Section 17052.6 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in California is amended to allow a credit against the \"net tax\" for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The percentage of the allowable federal credit varies based on adjusted gross income, with different percentages for different income brackets. The adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California. Different income brackets have varying percentages, with a maximum credit of 200% for those earning $100,000 or less before 2019. The adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California, with varying percentages based on income brackets. The credit is limited to expenses for household services and care provided in the state, and earned income subject to tax under this part. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is also considered. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces, other than pensions or retired pay, is considered earned income subject to tax in California. The definition of a qualifying individual for tax purposes is modified to include children as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, a child is considered a qualifying individual if they receive over half of their support from a parent with custody for the majority of the year. This applies to children of unmarried parents who lived apart for the last six months of the year and are in the custody of one or both parents for over half of the year. The amendments to tax laws regarding child custody apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act enacts a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
