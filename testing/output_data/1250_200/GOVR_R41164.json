    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, while RUS received $2.5 billion for rural broadband projects. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) under the RUS broadband grant and loan program focused on distributing ARRA broadband funding. Two rounds of funding were announced in 2009 and 2010, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. Projects included last-mile broadband infrastructure. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) offered grants and loans for various broadband projects. BTOP categories included last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. BIP projects could be last mile remote area, last mile nonremote area, or middle mile. The NTIA and RUS released data on applications for broadband funding, with over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding. A total of $4.8 billion was made available for the second round of funding, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. Streamlined application processes and significant changes were made based on feedback from the first round. In response to feedback from the first round, NTIA and RUS made significant changes for the second round of BTOP and BIP funding. Each agency had its own NOFA, with BTOP focusing on middle mile projects and BIP on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for anchor institutions. BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was removed, with BIP projects now required to cover at least 75% rural areas. In the second round of BTOP and BIP funding, projects were required to cover at least 75% rural areas and not have High Speed Access broadband service at 5 Mbps in 50% of its area. Eligible BTOP projects needed an eligible entity, completed application, and 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion, with requests for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure, Sustainable Broadband Adoption, and Public Computer Centers. RUS announced the applications breakdown on April 16, 2010. In the second round of funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. RUS received 30 middle mile applications totaling $845.88 million. By October 1, 2010, all BTOP and BIP award announcements were completed, with a total of 553 projects awarded $7.5 billion in federal funding, including $6.2 billion in grants and $1.3 billion in loans. A total of $7.5 billion was announced for 233 BTOP projects and 320 BIP projects, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. 51% of funding went to middle mile projects, while 49% went to last mile projects, with 93% of loan funding awarded to last mile projects. Deployment of broadband infrastructure includes various technologies like fiber. The majority of loan funding (93%) was awarded to last mile projects, with 56% of all infrastructure projects funded being fiber projects. Projects involving fiber account for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. State-by-state breakdown of BTOP and BIP funding is shown in Table A-1, while per capita funding by state is shown in Table A-2. Funding is associated with a state based on the service area covered by the project. Table A-3 lists both NTIA and RUS multistate awards. In FY2011, the Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations Act included a $20 million addition for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure BTOP grants' impact. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects. The award was obtained through the Department of Interior's National Business Center. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of funding could provide insights into the future of broadband grant and loan programs."
