    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a high mortality rate and low survival rate compared to other types of cancer. The incidence of lung cancer is projected to increase significantly, especially among minority communities. Lung cancer has a low survival rate compared to other cancers, with research funding being the least among major cancers. The National Cancer Institute highlighted the lack of funding for lung cancer research in 2001 and emphasized the need for a comprehensive research program. Smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer, but radon and other environmental contaminants are also significant contributors. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in the onset of lung cancer. Lung cancer is highly stigmatized and often blamed on patients, even those who never smoked. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers, with a majority being former smokers who quit years ago. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with a higher impact on women. It is the leading cause of cancer death across all ethnic groups, including military personnel exposed to carcinogens. Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk for lung cancer. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment. Studies suggest that early detection could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US, and a 4-percent annual decline in lung cancer mortality could significantly reduce the economic burden of the disease. The National Cancer Institute conducted a study comparing low-dose CT scans and standard chest x-rays for lung cancer screening. Results showed a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer deaths among participants screened with CT scans. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program involves strategic research grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute. The National Cancer Institute is providing research grants to reduce lung cancer mortality. Funds are allocated to expand research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and innovative diagnostic and treatment methods. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is also receiving funds to develop screening and imaging technologies to reduce lung cancer mortality. The Quantum Grant Program and Image-Guided Interventions programs of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering are receiving funds for research. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is implementing research programs on lung cancer incidence. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities is collaborating on research and outreach programs to address the impact of lung cancer on minority populations. The Food and Drug Administration is providing funds to establish quality standards for healthcare facilities. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program provides access to early detection services for high-risk populations. Funds are allocated for research on environmental contaminants related to lung cancer. The program also includes expedited revision of standards for imaging technology and an annual compliance review. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program aims to research environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer, reduce risk, and provide early detection. State plans must include measures to reduce lung cancer mortality. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reviews early detection methods and treatment protocols annually. Coordination across programs ensures all aspects of the program address disparities. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program requires coordination across all tobacco control and cessation programs within the Department of Health and Human Services to address disparities, with a focus on women and minority, rural, and underserved populations. This includes coordinating drug and other cessation treatments with early detection protocols. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, implement a demonstration project for military personnel and veterans at risk for lung cancer, and establish coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project within a year, in collaboration with various agencies and experts. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project aims to identify optimal risk populations, develop effective screening processes, ensure quality controls, and integrate health information technology. The project will involve selected National Cancer Institute Centers, Department of Defense Medical Treatment Centers, Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network sites, International Early Lung Cancer Action Program sites, and community health centers for minority populations. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. The demonstration project will run for 5 years, with a report on projected costs due to Congress within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the projected cost of the demonstration project and provide annual progress reports thereafter. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor programs under the Act, composed of various government officials and representatives from relevant fields. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
