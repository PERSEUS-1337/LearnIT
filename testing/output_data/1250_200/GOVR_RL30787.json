    "content": "House procedures are not solely based on the Rules adopted at the beginning of each new Congress. They also include constitutional mandates, parliamentary principles from Jefferson's Manual, laws that act as rules, precedents, and informal practices. Additionally, committee rules, jurisdiction agreements between committees, and party caucus/conference rules are part of House parliamentary procedure. These documents serve as official records of parliamentary authorities and are cited by members when raising points of order. The chief authorities governing House parliamentary procedure are outlined in the House Manual with annotations by the parliamentarian, including the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, House Rules, and relevant laws. The House Manual contains key reference documents such as the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, House Rules, and rule-making statutes. Another set of official documents includes House Practice, Deschler's Precedents, Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents, and parliamentary reference documents prepared by committees. These documents compile precedents, rules adopted by committees, jurisdiction agreements, and floor procedures in the U.S. House of Representatives. The curr_chunk discusses various parliamentary reference sources in the U.S. House of Representatives, including memorandums of understanding between committees, floor procedures, and rules of the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference. It reviews the format and content of these documents, with sample pages provided. Information on locating these authorities in different sources is also included. The curr_chunk provides information on how to locate parliamentary reference sources in the U.S. House of Representatives through various sources, including printed documents and the Internet. It also highlights the principles governing House procedure and the availability of official guidance from the Office of the House Parliamentarian and CRS staff. The House of Representatives is governed by multiple authorities, not just chamber rules. It has the power to make its own rules, which are not self-enforcing. Precedents are rarely disregarded, and many practices are followed without formal adoption. The Constitution grants the House the authority to determine its rules of procedure, impacting House procedure in various ways. The House of Representatives has the authority to determine its rules of procedure, which it exercises by adopting rules at the beginning of each Congress. This rule-making power includes the adoption of special rules and rule-making statutes that govern House procedures. Special rules define specific procedures for considering individual measures, while rule-making statutes prescribe rules for the consideration of a class of measures specified by the act itself. These special rules and rule-making statutes have the same standing and effect as the House rules. The House of Representatives adopts rules at the beginning of each Congress, including special rules and rule-making statutes that govern procedures. These rules have the same standing as House rules and can be used to set terms for considering measures. The House can also suspend its adopted rules by unanimous consent or a two-thirds vote. The House of Representatives can take parliamentary actions that violate its rules by unanimous consent or a two-thirds vote. Members can raise points of order if rules are being violated, and the chair rules on their validity. If sustained, the House cannot proceed with the action. The chair enforces House Rules and procedural authority by ruling on points of order raised by members. The chair may also make announcements regarding proper procedure and decorum. Points of order and rulings only apply to procedural questions, not constitutional violations. The chair enforces House Rules and procedural authority by ruling on points of order raised by members, but does not have authority over constitutional violations. The judgment on constitutional matters is settled by the vote of the body. Caucus or conference rules and informal practices are not enforceable on the House floor. Committee rules cannot be enforced on the House floor but can be enforced within the committee. The House rules are enforced by the chair through rulings on points of order, with precedents established through these rulings. Appeals to the House itself are rare and usually result in upholding the chair's ruling. Precedents can also be set through parliamentary inquiries or procedural decisions made by a majority vote. Precedents in the House are established through rulings on points of order by the chair, parliamentary inquiries, or procedural decisions made by a majority vote. They guide the application of current House rules by relating past decisions to the specific case at hand, similar to case law. Precedents carry varying weight, with those based on points of order or decisions by majority vote holding more significance. Members cite precedents to support their arguments, and the chair often cites predecessors' decisions to justify rulings. The House rarely disregards its precedents. The weight of precedents in the House is determined by the chair's rulings on points of order or decisions by majority vote. Recent precedents hold more weight than earlier ones, especially if they are part of an evolved pattern. Precedents must be evaluated in the historical context of the rules and practices at the time they were established. Members seeking precedents to support their arguments may consult the Parliamentarian of the House. Some House procedural actions are based on informal practices that have evolved over time and become accepted customs, although they are not formally adopted. These informal practices are rarely challenged on the House floor. The House operates based on precedents determined by the chair's rulings or majority vote. Informal practices, rarely challenged on the House floor, include Speaker's recognition for speeches and committee members' priority in offering amendments. The House Manual compiles parliamentary sources like the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, and House Rules with annotations summarizing relevant precedents and practices. The House Manual, also known as Jefferson's Manual, is an official document published by the Government Printing Office for each Congress. It includes parliamentary authorities and reference sources, with each edition designated by a House Document number from the preceding Congress. The House Manual, also known as Jefferson's Manual, contains parliamentary authorities and reference sources. It includes a comprehensive index, annotations by the Parliamentarian, and a preface summarizing changes to House Rules. The Manual is organized in numbered sections for easy citation and reference across editions. House Rules were recodified in the 106th Congress, reducing the number from 52 to 28. The House Manual, also known as Jefferson's Manual, underwent recodification in the 106th Congress, reducing the number of rules from 52 to 28. The extensive index in the Manual provides citations by section number, breaking down major topics into subheadings with descriptive specifications. Annotations by the Parliamentarian, known as \"Parliamentarian's notes,\" offer historical context for procedural authorities cited in the Manual. The \"Parliamentarian's notes\" provide historical context and useful information about procedural authorities cited in the House Manual. They explain current practices, describe important precedents, and include citations to official publications for further reference. The parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual provide valuable insights into precedents, clarifying the relationship between specific clauses and operational procedures. These annotations are regularly updated to include important precedents not found in earlier compilations, making them a time-saving research tool. The House Manual includes important precedents not found in earlier compilations, with citations in parentheses for easy reference. The parliamentarian's annotations explain how the House and courts interpret constitutional provisions, particularly Article I, section 5, which outlines procedural requirements for the House. The House Manual includes procedural requirements for the House, such as adopting its own rules, keeping an official journal, having a quorum, and conducting yea and nay votes. The parliamentarian's annotations provide practical applications of these provisions. House Rule XXVIII references Jefferson's Manual for parliamentary practice. Jefferson's Manual was written by Thomas Jefferson during his time as Vice President. Jefferson's Manual, written by Thomas Jefferson during his time as Vice President, is a statement of parliamentary law based on British House of Commons practices. While originally intended for the U.S. Senate, it is not considered an authority on Senate procedure today. The House Manual incorporates relevant sections of Jefferson's Manual, with annotations by the parliamentarian explaining its application to House parliamentary procedure. The House Manual incorporates important parliamentary procedures based on Jefferson's Manual, with annotations by the parliamentarian. It includes rules for debate, amendments, and resolving differences between houses. The House approves rules at the start of each Congress, with amendments recommended by the majority party. Non-germane amendments are prohibited, with detailed coverage in the parliamentarian's annotations. The House Manual for each Congress includes detailed annotations by the parliamentarian on parliamentary procedures and rules adopted by the House. The Clerk's Print, published early in each Congress, contains the text of House Rules as amended. A major recodification of the Rules of the House in the 106th Congress reduced the number of rules from 52 to 28. The recodification of the House Rules in the 106th Congress reduced the number of rules from 52 to 28. Explanations of the changes and how each rule is derived from previous provisions are provided in the Manual. The House has the authority to establish procedural regulations through simple resolutions or statutory measures. Additional information on the recodification can be found on the House Committee on Rules website. The House can establish procedural regulations through statutory measures, which require agreement between both chambers and the President. These procedures are created through each chamber's constitutional rule-making power and have the same standing as House and Senate rules. Statutory rule-making provisions often specify legislative procedures to be followed in the House. Statutory rule-making provisions in the House include expedited procedures for congressional action on executive branch proposals, regulations on the congressional budget process, and provisions from legislative reorganization acts. The House Manual contains these provisions with annotations by the parliamentarian. The House Manual contains statutory rule-making provisions with annotations by the parliamentarian, including procedures for congressional action on executive branch proposals and regulations, as well as provisions from legislative reorganization acts. The Manual also includes a section on \"Statutory Legislative Procedures\" for the 110th Congress, outlining special procedures for Congress to follow in disapproving or approving actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures typically establish expedited processes for enacting joint resolutions of disapproval or approval. The House Manual contains statutory rule-making provisions with annotations by the parliamentarian, including procedures for congressional action on executive branch proposals and regulations. These provisions create privileged procedures for approval or disapproval measures, with some drawn from statutes like the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Many of these statutes are infrequently used, and the Manual includes provisions affecting House procedure. The House Manual contains rule-making provisions from statutes like the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, governing congressional budget process. It includes sections from other acts such as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and the Trade Act of 1974, establishing procedures for considering budgetary legislation in the House and Senate. The Congressional Budget Act requires Congress to adopt a budget resolution each year to set spending, revenue, and deficit targets. Budget resolutions may also include procedural regulations for subsequent budget-related measures. The budget resolution is a concurrent resolution that governs subsequent action on spending bills or budget-related measures. Procedural provisions in budget resolutions operate with the same force as procedural rules of the respective houses and can be altered through internal procedures. Some provisions are temporary, while others are permanent procedures. Some procedural provisions in budget resolutions are established as permanent procedures, altered or abolished only by further action in subsequent budget resolutions. These provisions often concern Senate procedures and may have bicameral application. They can be identified by examining texts of adopted congressional budget resolutions. The FY2008 resolution, for example, established limitations against \"advance appropriations.\" The 110th Congress established limitations on \"advance appropriations\" in the House of Representatives for FY2008. House precedents are recorded in the Congressional Record and compiled in official publications such as House Practice and Deschler's Precedents. The House of Representatives relies on three collections of precedents, including Deschler's Precedents, Hinds' Precedents, and Cannon's Precedents, to establish principles and procedures. These documents serve as predecessors to House Practice, which provides the most current information on House rules and procedures. Members seeking precedents for parliamentary arguments are advised to consult the Office of the House Parliamentarian for official advice. The House Practice publication is the most current reference source for House rules and procedures. It was first prepared by William Holmes Brown and later updated by Charles W. Johnson III. Organized into chapters covering 59 subjects, it provides detailed information on House procedure.

Readers can use the index to locate specific procedural topics, and significant House precedents are detailed in Deschler's Precedents volumes. Deschler's Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, initiated by Lewis Deschler and continued by his successors, covers precedents established after 1936. Volumes extend coverage to later points over the years, with volume 1 concluding at the first session of the 93rd Congress and volume 16 covering precedents through the 105th Congress. Citations refer to rule numbers and sections of the Manual before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress.

The chapter structure of Procedure parallels that of Deschler's Precedents, making it useful for locating materials indirectly. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, also known as Deschler's Procedure, is organized into chapters with numbered sections and paragraphs. Each section contains principles established by precedents or general rules. The publication is commonly cited by its title, chapter, section or paragraph number, and page number. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, known as Deschler's Procedure, provides statements of principles represented by precedents. It does not include descriptions or quotations from procedural exchanges but references specific precedents by citing the Congressional Record.

The excerpt discusses the addition of new paragraphs to the main volume of Cannon's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes precedents selected by Clarence Cannon. It provides citations to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents and the Congressional Record for reference. Cannon's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives includes sample floor dialogues for parliamentary actions, but many are outdated. The suspension procedure discussed in the manual is now obsolete in several aspects. House procedure is governed by the Constitution, rules, precedents, and informal practices. The House procedure is governed by the Constitution, rules, precedents, and informal practices. These informal practices, although not formally adopted, supplement the rules and provide guidance on the actual courses of action in the House. Some practices are embodied in written statements, such as the Speaker's policies and memorandums of understanding between committees. These policies specify how certain Rules of the House will be carried out or how discretionary powers will be exercised. Speakers periodically announce policies reflecting their authority under the Rules of the House. These policies, developed in consultation with the minority party, are reiterated at the start of each new Congress. Some policies are renewed through unanimous consent requests, and details are published in the Congressional Record and House Calendar. The House Calendar contains policies for the 110th Congress, including privileges of the floor, introduction of measures, decorum in debate, electronic votes, handouts, and cell phone use. Standing committees create memorandums of understanding on jurisdiction over policy issues. Memorandums of understanding advise the Speaker on referring legislation to committees when jurisdictional mandates overlap. The Speaker and House Parliamentarian consider these memorandums in decision-making, making them an important reference source for jurisdiction over policy issues in Congress. Some memorandums are publicly available in the Congressional Record, while others are not disclosed. Memorandums of understanding play a crucial role in advising the Speaker on referring legislation to committees when jurisdictional mandates overlap in Congress. Some memorandums are publicly available in the Congressional Record, while others are not disclosed. The importance of memorandums of understanding increased due to rules changes in the 104th Congress, which eliminated joint referrals and specified primary jurisdiction for committees. This led to the development of memorandums specifying committee jurisdiction over particular issues. Memorandums of understanding between committees in Congress establish jurisdiction over issues. The internal structure of the House of Representatives includes committees and party conferences. Committees develop legislative proposals, while party conferences assign members to leadership roles. Each group has its own rules that impact House proceedings. The House Rules, particularly Rule XI, regulate proceedings and actions in House committees. Each committee must adopt its own rules of procedure, covering aspects like quorum and voting requirements. These rules must be consistent with House Rules and are enforced within the committee but not on the House floor. The House Rules, particularly Rule XI, regulate proceedings in House committees. Committees must adopt their own rules of procedure, consistent with House Rules, enforced within the committee but not on the House floor. The House Committee on Rules compiles rules of procedure adopted by all House standing committees in each Congress. The rules of the House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference are adopted by House Members during early organizational meetings after the November congressional election. These rules are printed and distributed to members of the respective conference, but are not official parliamentary reference sources of the House. They are not directly enforceable on the House floor. Conference rules are binding on party members and govern actions in House proceedings. They cover the selection of leaders, committee assignments, and meetings. Some rules also address floor procedures and can impact legislation consideration. For example, Rule 38 of Democratic Caucus rules for the 110th Congress directs party leadership on the consideration of measures. The House rules prohibit the consideration of measures by suspension of the rules if they have not been cleared by party leadership, will be amended other than by committee amendments, are \"major\" legislation, were opposed by more than one third of the reporting committee, or cost more than $100 million in any fiscal year.
