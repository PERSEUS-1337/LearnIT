    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress recognizes the risks law enforcement officers face daily, the lack of support from the Federal Government, their role in combating drugs and crime, the increase in violent crime and drug use, the need for a review of current issues, and the importance of studying law enforcement with Federal Government support. A comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, including the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers and responsibility for crime control, would help redefine relationships between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement officials.
