It oversees the transfer of radio frequencies to the commercial sector and focuses on supporting the innovation economy. Notable programs include promoting broadband infrastructure deployment. The NTIA plays a key role in promoting broadband infrastructure deployment and supporting the innovation economy in the United States. This includes advocating for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet policymaking and identifying spectrum for wireless technologies. The NTIA also administers grants programs like the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program to help achieve these goals. The NTIA is starting a $135 million grant program to assist states in planning for a new public safety broadband network. FirstNet, funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund, has access to $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury and expects $5 billion more from auction revenues. The President's budget request for NTIA in FY2014 was $52.1 million. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $45.1 million for salaries and expenses in FY2013, with no separate program funding. In FY2010, the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) made up half of the NTIA's budget. By FY2011, total budget appropriations for NTIA increased by 4% to $41.6 million, with PTFP funding shifted to administrative expenses. The increase in funding from FY2010 to FY2011 was mainly due to broadband deployment costs mandated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Requests for grant program funding in FY2012 totaled $32.3 million, primarily for broadband programs like BTOP. In FY2013, $25.8 million was designated for broadband grant programs, mainly BTOP. The FY2014 request for broadband grant program oversight was $24.7 million, around 40% of the total budget request. NTIA also receives funding from fees charged to federal agencies. The NTIA's FY2014 budget request includes $24.7 million for broadband grant program oversight, representing roughly 40% of the total budget request. Additional funding sources for NTIA include spectrum management fees from federal agencies. A new program for spectrum monitoring and assessing technologies for sharing radio frequency spectrum is proposed, with funding of $7.5 million and staff increases of eight FTEs. Congress and the Administration have mandated NTIA to identify and release more radio frequency spectrum for wireless broadband use, requiring $1.25 million and five FTEs for the Office of Spectrum Management for Wireless Broadband Access. The NTIA's FY2014 budget request includes $24.7 million for broadband grant program oversight, with additional funding from spectrum management fees. A new program for spectrum monitoring and assessing technologies is proposed, requiring $7.5 million and eight FTEs. The Office of Spectrum Management for Wireless Broadband Access requests $1.25 million and five FTEs. The NTIA collaborates with the FCC and Department of State on spectrum issues and participates in developing Internet policy. The NTIA collaborates with various federal agencies, including NIST, FCC, and DHS, to provide expertise and guidance for grant recipients using BTOP funds. The Office of Spectrum Management formulates plans to ensure efficient spectrum use nationally and internationally, addressing future federal government spectrum requirements. The Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) handles federal government satellite network coordination, frequency assignment, and spectrum certification. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) conducts research and prepares policy recommendations on telecommunications. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) promotes policies to enhance U.S. companies' global competitiveness in ICT sectors. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) provides technical support for advancing telecommunications infrastructure. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) supports NTIA in advancing telecommunications and information infrastructure, enhancing competition, improving trade opportunities, and promoting efficient use of the radio spectrum. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) administers grant programs for technology deployment. The Office of Public Safety Communications administers provisions of the Spectrum Act. Salaries and expenses are organized into sub-activities for Domestic and International Policies, Spectrum Management, Telecommunication Sciences Research, and Broadband Programs. In FY2010, the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) received $20 million in funding to support broadcast and non-broadcast projects. Grants were awarded to public radio and television stations for equipment replacement, expanding services to underserved communities, and converting to digital broadcasting. These grants helped maintain the Emergency Alert system and support Wireless Emergency Alerts. The Spectrum Act of 2012, also known as the Public Safety and Spectrum Act, allocated more spectrum for commercial services and established the NTIA's role in supporting FirstNet. The NTIA manages the Public Safety Trust Fund and oversees the State and Local Implementation Fund grant process through the Office of Public Safety Communications. FirstNet operates as an autonomous entity in planning and managing a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. The Office manages service-level agreements for FirstNet, an autonomous organization with broad powers. NTIA may have exceeded its role by setting its own requirements for FirstNet. Funding for operating costs on a short-term basis hinders long-term investments. The act re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office for next-generation systems. The act re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to plan for next-generation systems (NG 9-1-1) and administer a grant program for improvements in 911 emergency services. ICO will provide matching grants from a $115 million grant program, funded after $27.635 billion of auction revenue is allocated. NTIA will ensure auction revenues for the Public Safety Trust Fund are placed in the Network Construction Fund for FirstNet expenditures. The Trust Fund is placed in the Network Construction Fund for FirstNet expenditures. The fund is used for construction, maintenance, and related expenses for the nationwide network. The NTIA also provides grants to states for building their own radio access network links to FirstNet. The FY2014 budget estimates $1.908 billion in the Public Safety Trust Fund, with $257 million designated for the Network Construction Fund. A State and Local Implementation Fund is established for grants to support planning, consultation, and outreach activities. Expenditures from this fund were reported at $300,000 for FY2012. In FY2013, NTIA awarded over $116 million in grants to 54 states and territories, including seven projects for broadband communications for public safety under the BTOP program. Funding for these projects was partly suspended after the Spectrum Act to allow evaluation by the FirstNet board. FirstNet was granted the national license for public safety broadband, with separate lease agreements required for spectrum access. Negotiations on leasing agreements began in February 2013, with agreements reached with four BTOP grant recipients. The Spectrum Act updated procedures for reallocating spectrum from federal government to commercial use. The Spectrum Act updated procedures for reallocating spectrum from federal government to commercial use, requiring collaboration between NTIA and FCC to identify bands for release. It prioritizes exclusive, non-federal use through competitive bidding, with a Technical Panel overseeing federal agency transition plans. The Spectrum Act requires key government officials to appoint members to a technical panel for managing radio frequency spectrum. The Act aims to increase spectrum availability for mobile services like Internet access, particularly for smart phones and tablets. Policy proposals include clearing federal users from certain frequencies for commercial use, sharing federal frequencies with specific commercial users, improving federal spectrum efficiency, and utilizing emerging technologies for spectrum management. The NTIA supports increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz, with a 10-year plan identifying bands for commercial wireless broadband service. Recommendations include making 15 MHz available between 1695-1710 MHz, 100 MHz between 3550-3650 MHz, and studying two 20 MHz bands within 4200-4400 MHz for repurposing. The proposal will be considered at the World Radio Conference in 2015-2016. The World Radio Conference (WRC-2015) is the primary forum for negotiating international treaties on spectrum use. Decisions on federal spectrum use are made through the Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC), which includes representatives from the U.S. military and federal agencies. The Commerce Spectrum Advisory Committee (CSMAC) advises the NTIA on spectrum policy issues. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18 billion cost to clear federal users from the band. The NTIA estimated an $18 billion cost to clear federal users from the 1755-1850 MHz band. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies cleared for auction. The GAO highlighted undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies, suggesting options like spectrum usage fees, more unlicensed spectrum, and improved regulatory processes. The GAO found that further study by the NTIA and the FCC was needed regarding spectrum sharing policies. The Department of Defense offered to release frequencies between 1755-1780 MHz to control relocation costs. NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal for releasing frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz. Congressional hearing challenged NTIA's cost estimates for relocating federal agencies from the band. The NTIA was criticized during a congressional hearing for not separately evaluating the 1755-1780 MHz band for auction. The GAO presented preliminary findings on DOD estimates of reallocation costs for frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz, noting variable assumptions for costs and revenues. NTIA leads interagency efforts to develop Internet policy and collaborates with other governments and international organizations. The NTIA leads interagency efforts to develop Internet policy and collaborates with other governments and international organizations. It plays a role in the Internet Policy Task Force and supports a multi-stakeholder approach to the coordination of the Domain Name System (DNS) for the long-term viability of the Internet. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO, is the research and engineering arm of the NTIA, providing core telecommunications research and engineering services. The NTIA provides core telecommunications research and engineering services, promotes domestic competition and new technology deployment, evaluates options for repurposing federal spectrum, oversees FirstNet activities, leads internet policy formation, and monitors broadband grants. Its role as a liaison may lead to overlapping responsibilities and duplication of effort across agencies. Rapid advances in communications technology have changed the NTIA's mission in areas such as spectrum policy. The NTIA's mission has evolved due to rapid advances in communications technology, particularly in spectrum policy. The 113th Congress may need to consider transferring some shared obligations to partners to allow the NTIA to focus on key communications policies for future economic growth. Oversight may include evaluating the agency's compliance with the Spectrum Act, specifically regarding spectrum transfer and public safety provisions."
