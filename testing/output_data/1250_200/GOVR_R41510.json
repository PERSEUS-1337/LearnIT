    "content": "The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress prohibits legislation affecting direct spending and revenues that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over a 6-year or 11-year period. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, includes programs like Medicare and unemployment compensation, while revenues are funds collected through taxes. The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress governs legislation impacting direct spending and revenues to prevent deficit increases over specified time periods. It excludes discretionary spending controlled through annual appropriations and requires offsetting provisions for any projected deficit increases. The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress governs legislation impacting direct spending and revenues to prevent deficit increases. It specifies that savings from a previously passed measure can be included in determining a separate measure's PAYGO compliance under certain conditions. The rule requires baseline estimates by the Committee on the Budget relative to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections, consistent with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The House PAYGO rule exempts direct spending increases or revenue reductions under existing law and provisions designated as emergencies from being counted towards compliance. Legislation with an emergency designation requires a full House vote for consideration, regardless of its budgetary effects being exempt from the rule. The rule is enforced by a. The House PAYGO rule, enforced by a point of order, prevents consideration of legislation increasing the deficit. It can be waived by special rule, suspension of rules, or unanimous consent. Effective for the current Congress, it was first established in the 110th Congress. The House PAYGO rule was first established in the 110th Congress and has undergone modifications in subsequent Congresses. It was replaced with the CUTGO rule in the 112th Congress but reinstated in the 116th Congress with certain modifications. The rule covers both mandatory spending and revenues, with the intention to prevent legislation increasing the deficit. The House PAYGO rule was established in the 110th Congress and has been modified in subsequent Congresses. It aims to prevent legislation that would increase the deficit by prohibiting consideration of bills affecting direct spending and revenues that would worsen the deficit over a 6-year and 11-year period. The rule includes on-budget and off-budget entities in determining the effect on the deficit and directs the Budget Committee to use specific baseline estimates from the CBO. The original rule had no explicit exemptions, unlike the 116th Congress. In the 111th Congress, the House adopted its rules from the previous Congress, including the PAYGO rule with amendments. Changes included using CBO baseline estimates, allowing exceptions for combined measures, and exempting emergency provisions. Later in the second session, clause 10 of Rule XXI was further amended. In the 111th Congress, the House amended the PAYGO rule to align with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The changes focused on scoring issues, such as excluding off-budget effects and requiring consistency with the Statutory PAYGO Act in determining budgetary effects of legislation. The PAYGO rule in the 112th Congress was replaced by the CUTGO rule, which focused on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only, excluding any effects on revenues. This rule prohibited legislation that would increase mandatory spending over specific periods. The CUTGO rule replaced the PAYGO rule in the 112th Congress, focusing on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. It excluded any effects on revenues and prohibited legislation increasing mandatory spending over specific periods. The rule did not continue the \"adjustments for current policies\" from the Statutory PAYGO Act, and it generally retained procedures from the previous PAYGO rule. The CUTGO rule was renewed in each subsequent Congress until the 115th Congress. The PAYGO rule was reinstated by the new Democratic majority in the 116th Congress, replacing the previous CUTGO rule. The new PAYGO rule incorporates projected revenue effects, including off-budget effects like those affecting the Social Security trust funds. It retains procedures from the former rules, such as combining budgetary effects of measures and excluding emergency effects. The House PAYGO rule coexists with similar requirements in statute. The House PAYGO rule, along with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, aims to prevent legislative actions that would increase the on-budget deficit. While similar, they differ in enforcement, with the House rule applying during legislation consideration on the House floor. The Statutory PAYGO Act only pertains to on-budget effects, excluding off-budget impacts like those on the Social Security trust funds. The Statutory PAYGO Act applies the requirement to legislation after it has been enacted, ensuring that the net effect of all bills affecting direct spending and revenues does not increase the deficit over a 5 or 10-year period. This differs from the House PAYGO rule, which enforces compliance during legislation consideration on the House floor. The statutory PAYGO rule is enforced by sequestration to eliminate deficit increases from legislation, involving actions by the President and OMB. Budgetary resources are cut in certain programs to offset deficit increases, based on 5-year and 10-year scorecards. The PAYGO requirement applies to 5-year and 10-year scorecards, with sequestration triggered if a positive balance is shown, requiring the President to issue a sequestration order. The House PAYGO rule must be adopted at the start of each new Congress, while the Statutory PAYGO Act has no expiration date. It is not in order to consider any bill that increases the deficit for specific fiscal years. The evaluation under paragraph (a) of a bill, joint resolution, or amendment excludes provisions designated as emergencies for pay-as-you-go principles, as specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The evaluation of a bill, joint resolution, or amendment excludes provisions designated as emergencies for pay-as-you-go principles, as specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The terms \"budget year\" and \"current year\" are defined, and direct spending includes provisions in appropriations Acts. The term \"direct spending\" includes provisions in appropriations Acts that make outyear modifications to substantive law as described in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
