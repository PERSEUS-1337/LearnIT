    "content": "Coal-fired power plants are responsible for a significant portion of CO2 emissions in the U.S., making it a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Options include capturing and sequestering CO2, replacing coal with low-carbon sources like wind or nuclear power, or increasing the use of natural gas which emits less CO2 than coal. The abundance of natural gas reserves has sparked interest in using it as a relatively low carbon energy option. One proposal suggests achieving near-term carbon emission reductions by utilizing existing natural gas plants. Natural gas can play a key role in reducing CO2 emissions in the power sector, providing immediate and verifiable results. Existing gas-fired power plants can be used to significantly reduce emissions without the need for large spending programs. This solution is reliable and can be further expanded with the right incentives to further reduce emissions in the longer term. The report discusses displacing coal-fired generation with electricity from existing natural gas plants to reduce CO2 emissions. It highlights key issues for Congress to consider and includes background on gas-fired generation, feasibility issues, and policy considerations. Two appendices provide additional information on the electric power system. The report includes two appendices providing background information on the electric power system and gas-burning combined cycle generating technology. It discusses policy considerations and feasibility issues related to displacing coal with natural gas for electricity generation. The report focuses on displacing coal generation with underutilized combined cycle natural gas plants, the most efficient type. Peaking plants and old steam-electric natural gas plants are not reviewed due to inefficiency. Addressing these issues would require further analysis. The argument for displacing coal with natural gas is based on the large base of underutilized gas-burning power plants in the US. The report discusses the potential of underutilized natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants to replace coal plants in the US. Gas-fired power plants have been the primary new generating capacity in the country since the 1990s. This shift has doubled the natural gas share of total generating capacity between 1989 and 2007, making natural gas the largest component of the national generating fleet. However, coal still remains the largest source of actual electricity generation, accounting for 49% of all electricity produced in 2008. While natural gas is the largest source of generating capacity in the US, it trails behind coal in actual electricity generation. Gas-fired plants became popular in the 1990s and early 2000s due to cost, environmental, and safety concerns surrounding nuclear and coal power. The new plants were built with advanced combustion turbine technology, making natural gas the preferred choice for new non-renewable power plants. The latest design of combustion turbines, used in natural gas combined cycle power plants, is efficient and cost-effective. These plants can be built quickly and cheaply, costing about $1,200 per kilowatt of capacity. Compared to coal plants, NGCC plants have shorter construction times and lower costs. Natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants are efficient and cost-effective, with shorter construction times and lower costs compared to coal plants. NGCC technology allows for small-scale and modular construction, making it attractive for independent power producers in the 1990s. The operation of NGCC plants produces fewer harmful environmental impacts than coal-fired plants. NGCC plants have lower environmental impacts than coal-fired plants due to the nature of the fuel and greater efficiency. Natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burned. Combined cycle plants emit only about 40% of the CO2 per MWh compared to existing coal plants. The restructuring of the electric power industry in the 1990s led to the separation of power generation and construction from other utility functions, with independent power producers buying and constructing most new generating capacity. In the 1990s, independent power producers built many NGCC plants to meet baseload demand, adding 168,000 MW of capacity. Additionally, 89,843 MW of peaking turbines and 56,939 MW of other technologies were constructed, resulting in a 43% growth in generating capacity by 2007. This led to excess and underutilized capacity in the mid-2000s. The combined cycle building boom in the 1990s led to a 43% growth in generating capacity by 2007. However, excessive plant construction and high gas prices resulted in underutilized capacity. Only 13% of combined cycle plants operated at a baseload level in 2007, with a third having a utilization rate of less than 30%. The study group of NGCC plants had an average capacity factor of 42% in 2007, while coal plants had an average capacity factor of 75%. The underutilization of NGCC plants presents an opportunity to displace coal power with gas generation. If the utilization of NGCC plants could be doubled to 85%, it could generate additional power equivalent to 32% of all coal-fired generation in 2007 and displace about 19% of CO2 emissions associated with coal-fired electricity generation. The report discusses the feasibility of displacing coal with gas from existing power plants, focusing on transmission system factors, system dispatch factors, natural gas supply and price, and natural gas transportation and storage. NGCC plants could potentially displace up to a third of current coal-fired generation, but challenges exist in transmitting power to the same loads as coal plants. The report explores the potential of replacing coal with gas from existing power plants, particularly focusing on transmission system constraints. It highlights that NGCC plants may face challenges in sending power to the same loads as coal plants due to transmission interchangeability issues. The location of coal and NGCC plants varies regionally, with some overlap in regions like east Texas but disparities in areas like California and the Ohio River valley. Three main transmission system constraints are discussed: Isolation of the Interconnections, Limited long-distance transmission capacity, and Transmission system congestion. The analysis considers the proximity of coal and existing NGCC plants as a proxy for transmission feasibility. The analysis focuses on potential coal displacement by gas using the proximity of coal and existing NGCC plants as a proxy for transmission interchangeability. The electric power grid is divided into three interconnections - Eastern, Western, and ERCOT covering Texas. These operate independently with limited links between them, hindering surplus capacity from one interconnection to meet load in another. This isolation prevents the displacement of coal by surplus NGCC capacity in different regions. The power grid operates like a single giant machine within each interconnection, linking power lines, generating plants, and electricity consumers. It was not built with a master plan and transmission lines were initially constructed by single utilities to supply nearby population centers. As technology advanced, distances between power plants and loads increased, leading to interconnections between local grids. The local grids began to interconnect as utilities built jointly owned power plants, realizing the economic and reliability benefits. However, long-distance inter-regional lines were not prioritized, limiting the capacity to move power over great distances. Transmission of electricity over hundreds of miles results in losses, making it uneconomic. The debate over increased use of renewable power involves building and paying for new transmission lines to transport wind and solar power from remote locations to population centers. The use of renewable power requires building new transmission lines to move wind and solar power from remote areas to cities, displacing fossil-fueled plants. Transmission congestion can limit power movement, affecting regions like PJM and states like Montana and Utah. Transmission congestion can restrict power flows between states, such as Montana and the Pacific Northwest, and within states like southwestern Connecticut and load pockets like New York City. This congestion can increase costs for consumers and limit the ability to efficiently transfer power. The key aspect of transmission system congestion is the restrictions it imposes on power flows, rather than just the cost impact. The solution to congestion may not always require massive transmission construction. The solution for transmission congestion may not always involve extensive construction. A small number of selective additions to transmission capacity could lead to significant economic benefits for consumers. Analyzing transmission system limitations on coal displacement can be done using computer models, with a focus on the proximity of NGCC plants to coal plants for potential transmission line connections. The NGCC plant could potentially replace the coal plant if it has comparable transmission access. A proximity analysis was conducted using 2007 data to determine if NGCC plants within a ten-mile radius of coal plants could displace coal generation. The analysis calculated a ten-mile radius to displace generation from coal plants. NGCC plants near coal plants within 25 miles were also considered. The proximity analysis showed that existing NGCC plants could potentially displace 15% to 28% of coal generation. Other factors like utility systems, transmission capacity, fuel cost, and reliability requirements would also impact coal displacement potential. Table 5 presents the results of the proximity analysis, indicating that existing NGCC plants near coal plants could potentially displace 15% to 28% of coal generation and CO2 emissions. However, this would only account for a small fraction of total U.S. coal generation and emissions. The analysis suggests that existing NGCC plants may only be able to displace around 30% or less of coal-fired generation and CO2 emissions, with greater displacement depending on more distant NGCC plants. The configuration and capacity of the transmission system will play a crucial role in determining the actual potential for displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants. The system dispatch plays a crucial role in displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants. Monthly utilization patterns show that when coal plants are operating at their highest, NGCC plants are also at their peak operation, resulting in lower surplus gas-fired generation. This national monthly picture of power plant dispatch highlights the moment-to-moment system operation. The detailed analysis of power plant dispatch at Plant Barry in Alabama in November 2007 shows the challenges in displacing coal with gas, even during low utilization months for NGCC units. The graphic illustrates periods of high NGCC unit output and limited operation of coal units, highlighting the complexities involved in maximizing gas displacement of coal. The detailed analysis of power plant dispatch at Plant Barry in Alabama in November 2007 highlights challenges in displacing coal with gas. Large scale displacement of coal-fired generation by existing NGCC plants could significantly increase U.S. gas demand. Illustrative estimates show that replacing all displaceable coal-fired generation with existing NGCC plants could increase gas demand by 5% to 20%. This increased demand could potentially be met with a combination of increased domestic production and pipeline imports. The increased demand for natural gas could be met with a combination of increased domestic production, pipeline imports, Alaskan supplies, and imports of liquefied natural gas. The recent increase in natural gas availability from shale formations has led to interest in displacing coal with gas. Gas prices have declined due to higher production and reduced demand during the 2008-2009 recession. Optimism surrounds the long-term gas supply and price outlook, with estimates showing abundance in gas resources. The increase in natural gas availability from shale formations has led to optimism about long-term gas supply and price outlook. Estimates show a significant increase in gas resources, leading to a drop in wellhead prices for 2020 and 2030. Despite the positive outlook, forecasting natural gas markets remains challenging. The forecasting of natural gas prices has been challenging, with significant discrepancies between projections and actual data. Despite increased supply from shale gas, historical patterns show that initial hopes for production increases have not always been met. Drilling activity has declined as prices fall, but demand and prices tend to rise after economic downturns. The decline in drilling activity due to falling prices is followed by a rise in natural gas demand and prices after economic downturns. Demand destruction, or job loss, occurs during the lag between pricing signals and increased production. The potential increase in gas demand from a coal displacement policy could significantly accelerate gas demand, surpassing current forecasts by 2035. The rapid change from coal to gas could lead to a significant acceleration of gas demand growth, surpassing current forecasts by 2035. The national pipeline network, with 293,000 miles of pipelines, has the capacity to meet peak demands and is unlikely to be a constraint on coal displacement by existing NGCC plants. The maximum potential coal displacement equates to about 15 BCF per day of natural gas, which is only 7% of existing pipeline capacity. Increased use of gas-fired plants for coal displacement could potentially stress specific pipelines and storage facilities. Estimates show a significant increase in gas demand, ranging from 16% to 66%, which may require additional capacity. The natural gas industry has been effective at adding capacity to the pipeline system, with significant additions in recent years. The natural gas industry has the ability to install large amounts of additional transportation capacity to meet increased demand. Factors affecting the displacement of coal consumption by gas-fired plants include excess NGCC generating capacity, operating patterns of coal and NGCC plants, transmission grid capabilities, natural gas supply, and environmental impacts. The potential for gas displacement of coal must consider future conditions, not just the current situation. The cost of a coal displacement by gas policy is uncertain and depends on factors like natural gas and coal prices, infrastructure needs, and carbon costs. Economic impacts could affect other sectors, with increased power sector demand potentially raising natural gas prices for residential, commercial, and industrial users. The potential for displacing coal with natural gas could impact various sectors, with increased power sector demand potentially driving up gas prices. Congress may consider conducting a study to assess the feasibility and costs of replacing coal generation with power from existing gas-fired plants. This study would need to consider factors such as infrastructure capacity, electric rates, and uncertainties in natural gas prices. Congress may also consider exploring the potential for using gas in existing coal-fired plants as a way to displace coal while still utilizing existing transmission lines. This could offer a significant advantage in transitioning away from coal generation. Generating plants produce electricity using combustible fuels like coal, natural gas, and biomass, or non-combustible sources like wind, solar, or nuclear energy. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to demand centers, with higher voltage lines carrying more power with fewer losses. Policy discussions focus on high voltage networks for long-distance power movement. Capacity is the potential output of a generating unit, while energy is the actual electricity generated or released by a storage device over time. Units are typically expressed in kilowatts and kilowatt-hours or megawatts and megawatt-hours. Capacity factor is a measure of how intensively a power plant is utilized, calculated as the ratio of actual electricity produced to the maximum possible output. Demand for electricity varies throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon and decreasing at night. The daily load curve dictates how electric power systems are operated, with baseload units meeting minimum demand, intermediate units handling fluctuations, and peaking units meeting the highest daily loads. Load-following plants can also serve as spinning reserve units for unanticipated increases in load or backup during breakdowns. Peaking units are used to meet the highest daily loads and serve as spinning reserve. They are expensive to operate but can quickly start up and shut down. Economic dispatch prioritizes units with the lowest variable cost, based on efficiency measured by heat rate. Lower heat rate means greater efficiency and lower costs. The economic dispatch prioritizes units with the lowest variable cost, based on efficiency measured by heat rate. Lower heat rate equates to greater efficiency and lower costs. Different types of power plants are utilized based on their cost-effectiveness and fuel type. Nuclear, coal, and geothermal baseload units are first online due to low fuel costs. Combined cycle units meet intermediate load, while peaking plants are used to meet the highest loads. Variable renewable power plants like wind and solar are used to meet demand as available, displacing generation from gas-fired plants with higher costs. However, their output is not guaranteed due to weather dependency. Linking them to electricity storage can make their generation firm, but current storage options are limited. Variable renewable generation can be made firm by linking wind and solar plants to electricity storage, but current technology limits storage options. Combined cycle technology achieves high efficiency by capturing waste heat in the generating process. In a combined cycle unit fueled by natural gas, the gas powers a generator through a combustion turbine, with the exhaust directed to a heat recovery steam generator to produce steam for a second generator. Different configurations exist based on capacity needs, such as the 1x1 design illustrated in Figure B-1. In combined cycle plants, different configurations like 1x1, 2x1, or 3x1 designs can be used based on capacity needs. Natural gas is the predominant fuel used, but fuel oil or gasified coal can also be utilized. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are being developed, with prototypes operating in the US and a commercial-scale unit under construction in Indiana."
