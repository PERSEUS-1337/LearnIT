    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and project-based assistance make up a majority of the funding. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. The FHA collects fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus funds have been used to support the HUD budget, including emergency supplemental funding for disaster recovery. Recent years have seen significant increases in HUD's budget, with regular funding up by 57% in the past nine years. The rate of growth has also increased, with year-over-year increases of 5% in recent years. In recent years, HUD's budget has seen significant growth, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year. Adjusting for inflation, the \"real\" funding has grown by about 17% over a nine-year period. HUD's funding is comprised of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets, with most funding coming from regular annual appropriations. The annual appropriations acts determine funding for HUD's programs. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters. Appropriators face limits on discretionary funding and offset costs through rescissions and receipts. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by new appropriations and offsets like rescissions and collections. This budget authority does not necessarily reflect the actual funding for HUD programs, as offsets can impact the numbers. Despite a 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010, this growth is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. The 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010 is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by 37%, while offsetting receipts and collections decreased by more than 70% and rescissions by 96%. The growth in regular appropriations is mainly attributed to HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which saw a 70% increase in funding during the same period. From FY2002 to FY2010, appropriations for Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010, with a decline in offsetting receipts largely from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request in the prior fiscal year. The appropriations process for HUD begins with the President's budget request in the spring of the prior fiscal year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees craft their versions of legislation, aiming to avoid a government funding lapse by September 30. In cases of delays, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted. The FY2011 appropriations process lasted over a year, ending with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. The FY2011 appropriations for HUD began with the President's budget request, which proposed a decrease in net new budget authority but an increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The budget included funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while decreasing funding for other programs. The President's budget requested decreased funding for housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital repairs, and the brownfields redevelopment program. The House-approved FY2011 HUD funding bill provided $1 billion more than requested, with a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The bill rejected the proposed cuts and initiatives by the President, but was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill (S. 3644) that would have provided $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program, while also funding the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill funded the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, but it was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. During the fiscal year 2010, the 111th Congress passed several continuing resolutions to fund federal accounts, including HUD, at FY2010 levels. The last CR approved before the end of the Congress extended funding until March 4, 2011. It also extended FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. A year-long continuing resolution, H.R. 1, was approved by the House on February 18, 2011, to fund the government through FY2011, with some cuts to HUD accounts. H.R. 1 bill proposed funding cuts for HUD programs in FY2011, reducing aggregate appropriations by $5 billion (11%) and net new budget authority by $7 billion (16%) compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment (S.Amdt. 149) which would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding FY2010 funding. The Senate Amendment would have reduced net budget authority by over $1 billion (3%) but increased aggregate appropriations by about $900 million (2%) compared to FY2010. In FY2011, there was a $1 billion increase in aggregate appropriations for HUD compared to FY2010, mainly due to higher offsetting receipts from FHA. A short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44) was passed by the 112th Congress to fund the government until March 18, 2011, maintaining most accounts at FY2010 levels but reducing funding for some accounts, including the Community Development Fund (CDF) by approximately $195 million. This reduction in funding was equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI) in FY2010. In FY2011, a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48, P.L. 112-6) continued funding for most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but reduced funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF). Another short-term CR (P.L. 112-8) extended funding through April 15, 2011, with reductions in public housing operating funds. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long appropriations for HUD at FY2010 levels. The FY2011 appropriations for HUD included funding at FY2010 levels for some programs, while reducing funding for others and increasing funding for Section 8 programs. There was an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. However, the overall appropriations for HUD programs only decreased by 4% due to increased offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more accessible and affordable. The FHA insurance programs, funded through the MMI/CMHI and GI/SRI accounts, make mortgage credit more widely available and affordable. The MMI Fund, the largest of the FHA insurance funds, covers single-family home loans and the HECM program. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier mortgages, multifamily housing, and special-purpose loans. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 determines the cost of federal loan insurance based on expected cash flows. The subsidy rate is calculated as the difference between cash inflows from insurance premiums and cash outflows for loan defaults. The subsidy rate is calculated based on cash inflows and outflows of insured loans. It is expressed as a negative number if cash inflows exceed outflows, and as a positive number if outflows exceed inflows. The subsidy rate is used to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must periodically revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government through fees. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, making money for the government through fees. The Purchase and Refinance risk category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. This increase is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, including $960 million without FHA's proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration's, CBO still anticipated this category of the MMI Fund to be profitable in FY2011, not requiring a positive credit subsidy. The differences between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are detailed in Table 3. FHA's estimates of FY2011 negative credit subsidy were revised upward after the appropriations law was enacted in April 2011. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) was enacted in April 2011, leading to an increase in FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy. This was mainly due to a rise in the annual premium charged by FHA starting in April 2011. The President's FY2012 budget request indicated a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for the remainder of FY2011. FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for this category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts for FY2011 by over $1 billion during the appropriations process. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83%. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011 to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies, including increasing annual insurance premiums and adjusting the loan size formula. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed different amounts of credit subsidies for HECMs. The final FY2012 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) continued language from FY2010 directing the Secretary of HUD to make adjustments to the HECM program to result in a zero credit subsidy. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009. Despite newer mortgages having better credit quality, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. The MMI Fund must maintain a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% as mandated by Congress. The ratio fell below 2% in FY2009, prompting FHA to propose changes to its mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual premium. FHA proposed changes to its mortgage insurance programs, including increasing annual and upfront insurance premiums as mandated by Congress. The annual premium amounts were set at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5% and 1.55% for those with downpayments of 5% or less. FHA raised the annual premiums to 0.9% for loan-to-value ratios of 95% or higher and 0.85% for ratios below 95% in October 2010. Subsequently, on April 18, 2011, FHA further increased the annual premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront premium charged was also raised to the statutory cap of 3%. FHA adjusted its mortgage insurance premiums in response to Congressional mandates. The upfront premium was raised to 2.25% in April 2010 but later lowered to 1% in October 2010. Changes were also proposed for downpayment and credit score requirements, with borrowers with scores between 500-579 needing a 10% downpayment. FHA sought feedback on these changes in July 2010. FHA proposed reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3% and increasing oversight of FHA-approved lenders. Congress may grant FHA authority for additional enforcement actions through the FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072). The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to indemnify FHA for non-conforming mortgages, fraud, and misrepresentation. It proposed broader authority to terminate lenders with high default rates, established a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management, and allowed FHA to contract with credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance. Additionally, HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance for housing units through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance for housing units through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. Property owners in Section 202 may offer supportive services to residents, while Section 811 requires supportive services. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing have been funded. The President's FY2011 proposal aimed to redesign the programs, resulting in reduced funding. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010, and Section 811 would have received $90 million, compared to $300 million in FY2010. The House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. Both bills maintained the same funding level for Section 202 at $825 million, while differing in funding for Section 811 with H.R. 5850 providing $300 million and S. 3644 providing $200 million. The difference in funding levels was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. According to HUD FY2011 budget documents, $114 million would be used to renew vouchers. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $100 million less for the Section 811 account. Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs, and $150 million for the Section 811 program. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. Approximately $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than in FY2010. Within the funds for Section 202, $89 million was for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, with approximately $89 million allocated for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program. The account funds annual renewal for 2.3 million vouchers used by families, as well as administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. Funding allocation for voucher renewals has been a primary debate in HUD appropriations since FY2004. The funding allocation for voucher renewals for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program has been a primary debate in HUD appropriations since FY2004. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated to PHAs based on their voucher costs and utilization from the prior fiscal year. The amount provided was sufficient to fund over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, although PHAs were not using all of their vouchers in FY2009. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicate that PHAs had about 94% of their vouchers under lease in FY2009, leading to adjustments in funding allocation for CY2010. In FY2009, PHAs had about 94% of their vouchers under lease. CY2010 funding was based on FY2009 utilization, resulting in insufficient funding to cover all vouchers. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund 95% of all vouchers. The funding allocation formula was to be similar to FY2010, with the Secretary given authority to adjust allocations based on PHAs' reserve funding levels. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding increases for PHAs with low reserves to potentially serve more families. The budget also proposed lifting the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional leasing. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than requested, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report stated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient for program renewal needs. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated lower funding than anticipated in the President's budget, but deemed it sufficient for program renewal needs. The bill maintained the prohibition on over-leasing and changed the funding formula to reflect prior calendar year spending. S. 3644 also funded renewals below the President's request, citing revised estimates of need. S. 3644, like H.R. 5850, funded renewals below the President's request, using a formula based on calendar year spending. The Senate bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about potential cost increases. The committee report also directed HUD to report on plans for better monitoring of PHAs' financial management. Both H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law did not change the funding allocation formula from FY2010, providing less than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. HUD requested $114 million for this purpose in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than the requested amount for Section 811 renewals, directing the funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for administering authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million. In recent years, Congress has allocated additional vouchers for specific special populations or purposes, such as families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. The President's budget requested funding for new vouchers for supportive housing for at-risk families and individuals. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress also included funding for vouchers for homeless veterans and families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress would have funded the President's homelessness demonstration, provided $75 million for VASH vouchers, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP). The final FY2011 appropriations law provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account administers and renews existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. The project-based rental assistance program, active since the early 1980s, requires new annual appropriations for contracts to be renewed. In FY2011, over $9 billion was requested for this program, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. Funding has been a mix of current year and advance appropriations since FY2009. In FY2011, funding for the project-based rental assistance program was requested, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. The President's budget proposed $350 million for a new initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. The final appropriations law provided less funding than the President's request. The funding will be used to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. The new assistance aims to transfer 300,000 units from public housing properties and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. The proposed funding of $300 million aims to transfer 300,000 HUD-assisted housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program. The funding will cover the difference in subsidy costs and support activities to promote tenant mobility and landlord outreach. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act. The draft legislation, known as the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act, was not included in H.R. 5850 or S. 3644. Committees expressed concerns about the proposal's lack of development and unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. Public housing program provides rental units for low-income families, with over 1.2 million units maintained by PHAs. HUD provides funding to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) through the operating fund to cover maintenance, utilities, and administration costs, as well as the capital fund for large projects. The HOPE VI grant program supports the redevelopment of distressed public housing. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund, citing the availability of capital funding from previous legislation. PHAs can transfer up to 20% of their capital funding for operating expenses. The FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided higher funding for the capital fund compared to H.R. 1, but less than FY2010. The operating fund received about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves to compensate for reduced appropriations. The budget also allocated $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal aimed at revitalizing distressed neighborhoods. This initiative expands on the HOPE VI program by offering grants to a wider range of entities for neighborhood revitalization efforts. Nonprofits, for-profit developers eligible for funding aimed at transforming, rehabilitating, replacing HUD public housing. In FY2010, $200 million provided for HOPE VI, with $65 million for Choice Neighborhoods. House and Senate in FY2011 had different positions on funding. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, S. 3644 proposed $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD circulated draft legislation for Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. H.R. 5814 included authorization for Choice Neighborhoods Initiative but not enacted in 111th Congress. The Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) included authorization for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, but it was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI, with a majority of funding potentially used for Choice Neighborhoods. The Housing Trust Fund, created in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), aims to provide a permanent funding source for affordable housing, with grants to states for rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were intended as funding sources but were suspended in November 2008. The Housing Trust Fund, created in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, had its funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties. Despite requests for funding in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets, no funding has been directed to the fund yet. The final FY2011 appropriations law also did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, has not received funding despite requests in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to provide funding, but none were enacted. President Obama's Transformation Initiative seeks to enhance HUD's research and technology capabilities, with funding allocated for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Congress approved a $20 million appropriation in FY2010 to address mortgage fraud. In FY2010 and FY2011, Congress approved a $20 million appropriation for combating mortgage fraud. The President requested a 1% transfer authority to a transformation fund, but the fund received only $239 million instead of the potential $435 million in FY2010. In FY2011, the transformation fund could have received almost $470 million under the requested authority. However, both House and Senate bills limited the total funding available from transfers to less than half of the President's request. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to core department needs, with oversight emphasized. The bills did not include the authority for transfers under the Transformation Initiative, instead allocating funds for IT modernization and technical assistance. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program. The law also permitted HUD the requested transfer authority under the transformation initiative, but from a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform or restructure programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and eliminate funding for certain programs. Additionally, new initiatives such as Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse were requested. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed funding reductions for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to support new initiatives like Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. Additionally, a new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants initiative was proposed for economic development projects in distressed areas. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed funding reductions for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to support new initiatives like Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. A new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants initiative was also proposed for economic development projects in distressed areas. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including funding for congressional earmarked projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with funding for congressional earmarked projects as well. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, which is 21.2% less than the previous year. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) funding was cut by 33%. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) program was not funded. The CDF account supports activities through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). The CDF account, funded at $3.501 billion for FY2011, was reduced by 21.2% from the previous year. CDBG formula grants were cut by 16.4%, and SCI funding decreased by 33%. The BEDI program was not funded. CDBG supports neighborhood revitalization, housing rehab, and economic development activities. For FY2011, the Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based component of the program at its FY2010 level of over $3.9 billion. The budget request included funding for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the CDBG formula grant program higher than the President's request. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below its FY2010 funding level. H.R. 1 passed by the House reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion and prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. It did not specify how funds were to be allocated among the components of the CDBG program. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer reduced the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion and moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new Catalytic Competition Grants Program aimed at supporting economic development projects in distressed areas. Unlike CDBG funds, the CCG program funds would have been awarded competitively. The CCG program funds would have been awarded competitively to local governments, nonprofit entities, or consortia for reclaiming vacant property, supporting economic activities, and covering administrative costs. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated funds for this proposal. The Administration requested $148.5 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative, the same amount approved for FY2010. In FY2011, $100 million was requested for Regional Integrated Planning Grants under the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to support metropolitan areas in developing sustainable community models. The grants are done in collaboration with various federal agencies and aim to improve housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. Additionally, Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded to communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) includes Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) to reform building codes and zoning ordinances. HUD proposed grant awards not exceeding $2 million. Funding was requested for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011. Capacity building is a new component of SCI with unspecified funding. The administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the SCI with unspecified funding. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed continued funding of the SCI at $148.5 million. They also recommended allocating $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist in addressing housing and poverty-related issues. The bills proposed allocating $5 million for rural Indian tribes for revolving loan funds and technical assistance. They also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative and prohibited the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities. However, $99.8 million was appropriated for SCI activities in FY2011, representing a 33% reduction from the previous year. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to pledge their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. The CDBG entitlement communities and states can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities, with a term of up to 20 years. The Administration proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects. A fee-based assessment was suggested to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy, but this proposal was rejected by Congress. The FY2010 budget proposal to redesign the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program was rejected by Congress. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended different loan commitment ceilings and credit subsidies. P.L. 112-10 continued the program at the FY2011 commitment level. The program provides technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for the capacity building program by $10 million, establishing it as a stand-alone account. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. The proposal aimed to provide technical and financial assistance to CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments for community development and affordable housing activities. Successful grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this new initiative, but recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities by specific organizations. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) is funded by the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account, which also supports capacity building through SHOP. HUD provides grants for self-help homeownership opportunities where homebuyers contribute labor towards construction. Additionally, the account funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The SHOP program provides technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations to address the housing needs of the rural poor. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account but requested $60 million for a new Capacity Building account. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included a total of $82 million for the SHOP account, including $27 million for SHOP itself and $50 million for capacity building. The SHOP program received $82 million in funding in FY2011, with $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for the Housing Assistance Council. The final appropriations law continued funding at FY2010 levels with a total of $81.8 million allocated for account activities. HUD also planned to transfer funds to the Transformation Initiative account. HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program provides grants to approved agencies offering various counseling services. Funding for the program has increased in recent years due to concerns about mortgage default rates. From FY2003 to FY2010, funding rose from $39 million to $87.5 million. The President's FY2011 budget requested $88 million for the program. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed different funding amounts for HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program. However, in the 112th Congress, H.R. 1 did not include funding for the program for FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) eliminated funding for the program, leading to criticism of HUD's distribution of housing counseling grants. Congress has been criticized for delays in distributing housing counseling grants. Separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling has been allocated to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD since FY2008, creating the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. NeighborWorks, an independent nonprofit, received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities in addition to its regular annual appropriation. NeighborWorks received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities, and additional funding was allocated in subsequent years. The final FY2011 appropriations law maintained funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program at the FY2010 level of $65 million. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) at $65 million, consistent with FY2010 levels. Housing counseling agencies support foreclosure prevention initiatives like the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants for counseling high debt-to-income ratio homeowners eligible for HAMP. The Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) provide formula-based grants to Indian tribes for housing assistance to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. In FY2010, Congress allocated $700 million for NAHBG, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for NAHBG, a decrease of $120 million from the previous year, without any set-asides for technical assistance. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided nearly $650 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, which was over $50 million below the FY2010 enacted level but nearly $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 budget request. The law also maintained set-asides at FY2010 levels. The House and Senate establish parameters for considering legislation on spending and revenue through the budget resolution. It sets enforceable levels for spending, revenue, and public debt, and provides spending allocations to committees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees divide their allocations among subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. The budget committees consider the FY2011 budget resolution, receiving input from various sources. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011, but no further action was taken. The House Budget Committee did not report an FY2011 resolution. In 2010, the Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 (S.Con.Res. 60), but no further action was taken. The House did not report an FY2011 budget resolution. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) on July 1, 2010, setting spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations but provided subcommittee spending guidance for FY2011 appropriations bills. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion for NSP grants. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Community Development Fund for a third round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) grants. The act also authorized HUD to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance for homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. Additionally, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided disaster funding. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided $100 million in emergency funding for CDBG disaster relief for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 through May 2010. This funding was considered emergency FY2010 funding. For more information on CDBG disaster recovery assistance, refer to CRS Report RL33330."
