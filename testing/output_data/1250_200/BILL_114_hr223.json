    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016\" and focuses on the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Section 118(c)(7) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to prioritize programs and projects addressing key areas such as remediation of toxic substances, invasive species control, nearshore health protection, nonpoint source pollution mitigation, and habitat restoration. The Administrator shall collaborate with Federal partners to select programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration based on strategic environmental goals and measurable outcomes. The program or project selected for Great Lakes protection and restoration must achieve strategic environmental outcomes, demonstrate feasibility in implementation and results, and improve coordination and collaboration among agencies and organizations. The Administrator will consult with Great Lakes States, Indian tribes, and non-Federal stakeholders to select programs for protection and restoration. A coordinator will be designated to oversee projects involving harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. Funds for the Great Lakes Initiative will be used strategically for Federal projects, projects with various partners, and Program Office activities including sediment contamination remediation. The Administrator or other Federal agencies may grant funds to non-Federal entities for projects related to the Great Lakes Initiative, such as planning, research, monitoring, outreach, or implementation. The Administrator or other Federal agencies may grant funds to non-Federal entities for projects related to the Great Lakes Initiative, such as planning, research, monitoring, outreach, or implementation. Projects under the Initiative can be carried out locally, Great Lakes-wide, or Great Lakes basin-wide. Qualified non-Federal entities may include governmental entities, nonprofit organizations, institutions, or individuals. The Great Lakes Initiative prohibits the use of funds for water infrastructure activities if financial assistance is received from specific sources like State water pollution control revolving funds or the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. The Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 requires federal agencies to maintain funding for Great Lakes activities and identify new projects to support environmental goals. The Initiative Action Plan is reviewed and revised every 5 years by the Administrator and the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force. The Administrator, in consultation with Great Lakes States and tribes, reviews and revises the Initiative Action Plan every 5 years. Monitoring and reporting on progress is done publicly, with project information available on a website. The Initiative Action Plan for the restoration of the Great Lakes is reviewed and revised every 5 years in consultation with Great Lakes States and tribes. Progress is publicly monitored and reported, with project details available on a website. Funding details are provided to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works annually. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 authorizes $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 for programs related to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. This funding does not expand the Administrator's authority to implement projects under the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 26, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
