    "content": "Congress has been grappling with the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, such as health professional recruitment, mental health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs. Negotiations for reauthorization have led to multiple bills in the 106th-109th Congresses, with proposed changes not always accepted by HHS and other agencies. Negotiations for the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) have been ongoing for several years, resulting in multiple bills introduced in the 106th-109th Congresses. The bills, including S. 1057 and H.R. 5312, address Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. Congress also faces financial claims related to Indian trust funds, with individual claimants suggesting they are owed as much as $176 billion by the federal government. The mismanagement of Indian trust funds and lands has resulted in financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes, totaling as much as $176 billion. This issue has led to the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) within the Department of the Interior (DOI). The BIA has historically managed funds, lands, and physical assets held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals, with trust lands totaling about 56 million acres. Investigations in the 1980s revealed problems with asset documentation and land ownership. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address the mismanagement of Indian trust funds and assets. This led to the creation of the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Legal actions, including the Cobell v. Norton case, were taken to demand an accounting of funds and correction of mismanagement. Congressional consideration of settlements for Indian Individual Money (IIM) and tribal claims arose from trust fund and lands mismanagement. In the Cobell case, the district court found that the DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management. They were ordered to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage will determine the amount owed to the IIM plaintiffs, with DOI estimating losses in the tens of millions and plaintiffs estimating losses of over $100 billion. The court has issued orders requiring DOI to perform a historical accounting. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, estimating compliance costs at $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the orders, and Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. The district court has ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, with estimated costs of $12-13 billion. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. Concerns exist about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation and funding sources for potential settlements. Two settlement bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, have been introduced in the 109th Congress to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund. The bills would also create a commission to review Indian trust asset management, allow increased payments for individual Indian trust interests, and require an annual independent audit of all Indian trust funds. Hearings have been held on these bills by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the House Resources Committee. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee and House Resources Committee held hearings on settlement bills S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 in 2005 and 2006. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. In 2003, DOI reorganized BIA trust management operations at regional and agency levels. The DOI reorganized BIA trust management operations at regional and agency levels, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties. Bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management have not advanced in Congress. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust assets. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, with exceptions allowing gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development intended by Congress. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to curb exceptions in gaming regulations that allow gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. The bills remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed. They also retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes with limitations. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception and adds a new exception for tribes landless at the time of enactment. Opponents argue that the bills impose unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to restrict gaming regulations on trust lands acquired after 1988. Opponents argue that the bills impose unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. Native Hawaiians are not considered Indians under federal law but have federal programs authorized for their benefit. Native Hawaiian political entity recognition requires congressional action, separate from DOI process for Indian tribes. Bills in 109th Congress aim to establish recognition process, leaving governance and land issues for later legislation. Arguments for recognition based on Congress's authority over indigenous peoples in the US. Congress's constitutional authority over commerce with indigenous native peoples in the United States extends to all Native Hawaiians. They argue for a special political and legal relationship with Native Hawaiians, similar to that with Indian tribes, citing established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. Proponents claim that Native Hawaiians have not given up their sovereignty but had it forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Opponents dispute these claims. Opponents dispute the recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing that Congress lacks constitutional authority and that it would set a precedent for race-based political recognition. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission also raised concerns about racial discrimination. On May 5, 2006, a briefing report opposed the passage of S. 147 due to racial discrimination concerns. Some opponents disputed claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating it ended before 1893. Bills similar to S. 147 were considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on May 16, 2005. The Senate failed to proceed with S. 147 and S. 3064 on June 8, 2006. H.R. 309 has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309 on July 19, 2005."
