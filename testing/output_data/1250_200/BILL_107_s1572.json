    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace should be invited to become full NATO members, as stated in previous Acts. Additionally, Congress called for the prompt admission of certain countries to NATO to promote economic stability and security in the region. The NATO enlargement process should not only include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia but also consider inviting Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria to become full NATO members. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO in the first round of enlargement at the Madrid Summit in July 1997. At the Washington Summit in April 1999, NATO pledged to continue welcoming new members who can uphold the Treaty's objectives and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. No European democratic country fulfilling the Treaty's goals will be excluded from consideration for membership. In late 2002, NATO will decide on additional emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to invite for the next round of NATO enlargement. In May 2000, several countries declared their cooperation in seeking NATO membership, stating that success for one would be success for all. President George W. Bush mentioned Europe's new developments in a speech in Warsaw, Poland in June 2001. President George W. Bush and former President William J. Clinton expressed support for NATO enlargement to include all of Europe's democracies seeking membership and willing to fulfill responsibilities. Bush emphasized the importance of security and freedom for all European nations, while Clinton emphasized NATO's openness to emerging democracies in Europe. NATO is open to all of Europe's emerging democracies willing to fulfill membership responsibilities, with no automatic exclusions or veto power for countries outside NATO. The goal is to prevent a gray zone of insecurity from reemerging in Europe. SEC. 3. Declarations of Policy: Congress reaffirms support for NATO enlargement as expressed in previous acts and declarations, endorsing further enlargement as articulated by past presidents. SEC. 4. Designation of Slovakia to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Slovakia is designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, in addition to other countries previously designated for assistance under similar acts. Slovakia is designated as eligible for assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, along with other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. SEC. 5. Authorization of security assistance for countries designated under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Authorization of Foreign Military Financing for several countries under the Arms Export Control Act for fiscal year 2002, with specific grant amounts allocated to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Security Assistance Act of 2000."
