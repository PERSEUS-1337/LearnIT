    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost 4 decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to sue in Federal court for discrimination and questioning the validity of regulations. It also challenges the expectations set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent federal funding of discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ensured that Federal funds would not support discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. Regulations were put in place to protect beneficiaries, including prohibiting discriminatory criteria or methods of administration. These regulations, drafted by the same officials who created the Act, have never been invalidated. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 included regulations that have never been invalidated, as Congress rejected a proposal to do so in 1966. The Act aimed to benefit those discriminated against and relied on private attorneys for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to take legal action for discrimination under Title VI. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows individuals to take legal action for discrimination under Title VI, even though Congress did not explicitly state this right. The Supreme Court has recognized an implied right of action under Title VI, including the right to attorney's fees in private actions. The Court's decision in Sandoval had no legal or legislative basis for denying a right of action under regulations related to Title VI. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions, emphasizing their importance by requiring approval from the President. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices are consistent with disparate treatment prohibitions, allowing for discrimination to be addressed even when intent is not proven. The interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact not justified by program goals. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 reinstated the disparate impact standard under Title VII, ensuring that discrimination claims are not solely left to Federal agencies. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 reinstated the disparate impact standard under Title VII to prevent discrimination claims from being solely reliant on Federal agencies. However, a private right of action is necessary under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure individuals have a remedy for being denied equal access to various programs and services due to discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of many claims challenging unjustified discriminatory effects, highlighting the need for Congress to specify a private right of action. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 reinstated the disparate impact standard under Title VII to prevent discrimination claims from being solely reliant on Federal agencies. However, a provision added under this Act to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will waive sovereign immunity in the same manner as under the remaining provisions of that title. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that it is necessary to achieve nondiscriminatory goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addresses discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must show that a covered entity's policy causes a disparate impact, and if a less discriminatory alternative exists, the entity must adopt it. The person must demonstrate that each challenged policy causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a specific policy does not cause a disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove its necessity for achieving nondiscriminatory goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on disparate impact. It states that a policy or practice causing disparate impact must be changed to a less discriminatory alternative if available. The burden of proof lies on the person challenging the policy to show its impact, and a defense of necessity for achieving nondiscriminatory goals is not valid. Additionally, individuals cannot be discriminated against for opposing prohibited policies or practices. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the Act to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include a new section allowing aggrieved persons to bring actions. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 602A, which outlines the actions that aggrieved persons can take against covered entities for intentional discrimination or discrimination based on disparate impact. The aggrieved person may recover various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
