It amends the Clayton Act to address restraint of trade in telecommunications.

It prohibits mergers or acquisitions of such companies unless they promote competition and meet specific requirements set by the Attorney General and the Federal Communications Commission. The Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998 defines a large local telephone company as serving over 5% of telephone access lines in the US. It requires mergers or acquisitions of such companies to promote competition and meet specific requirements from the Attorney General and the Federal Communications Commission. Large local telephone companies must file an application with both entities when proposing a merger or acquisition. The Attorney General must report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees within 10 days of making a finding on the impact of the merger on competition in the telecommunications industry. The Attorney General and the Federal Communications Commission must issue a decision on mergers or acquisitions within a specific time frame. District courts have jurisdiction to prevent mergers inconsistent with findings under the Act. The Attorney General can take legal action if a proposed merger does not meet the required conditions. The Federal Communications Commission can prevent a merger if parties involved do not meet specified requirements. SEC. 4. PRESERVATION OF EXISTING AUTHORITIES. This Act does not affect antitrust laws or FCC authority regarding mergers of large local exchange carriers. Antitrust laws are defined in the Clayton Act. SEC. 5. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to mergers of large local telephone companies occurring after its enactment."
