    "content": "The opioid epidemic in the United States involves the abuse of various opioids, including prescription pain medications like hydrocodone and illicit drugs like heroin. In 2017, an estimated 11.4 million people misused opioids, with 11.1 million misusing prescription pain relievers and 886,000 using heroin. In 2017, 11.1 million people misused prescription pain relievers and 886,000 used heroin. SAMHSA estimated that 3.2 million Americans were current prescription pain reliever misusers, and 494,000 were current heroin users. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future Survey found that 3.4% of 12th graders used narcotics other than heroin in 2018. Opioids can help legitimate pain patients but abusing them poses short- and long-term physical risks, including nonfatal overdoses linked to various health issues. The severe physical harm associated with opioid abuse includes brain injury, respiratory problems, kidney and liver failure, seizures, and death due to overdose. Drug overdose deaths have increased significantly, with synthetic opioids being the main driver. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is a major contributor to the recent rise in overdose deaths. Addiction is a primary harm associated with opioids, leading to various public health and social problems. Drug overdose death rates vary by state, with states east of the Mississippi River having higher rates. In 2017, drug overdose death rates varied by state, with states east of the Mississippi River showing higher rates. The DEA and CDC noted an increase in overdose deaths in states with large fentanyl seizures. There is a strong link between synthetic opioid deaths and fentanyl reports in the NFLIS. The NIDA suggests that fentanyl-related deaths are likely underestimated due to lack of testing and reporting. Heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids are significant threats in the US. In 2017, heroin was reported as the greatest drug threat by 44% of local law enforcement agencies in the United States. The availability of controlled prescription drugs has decreased, while the availability of heroin and illicit fentanyl has increased. The market for opioids shifted significantly in the 1990s, with a rise in the abuse of prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone. The rise in illegitimate prescription drug use led to various methods of obtaining prescription opioids, including doctor shopping, pill mills, and prescription fraud. The federal government implemented measures such as grants for monitoring programs and crackdowns on pill mills to reduce unlawful drug supply. This crackdown, however, may have contributed to the increase in heroin abuse as it became a cheaper alternative to prescription opioids. The SUPPORT Act imposed tighter oversight on opioid production and distribution, limited Medicare coverage of prescription opioids, and proposed a reduction in opioid manufacturing for 2019. The DEA noted a decline in prescriptions for schedule II opioids since 2014 and aims to combat the opioid crisis while meeting medical needs. The trajectory of heroin supply is different from prescription opioids, but their stories are connected. The heroin supply in the late 1990s and early 2000s varied by region, with white powder heroin from South America dominating the market east of the Mississippi River and black tar and brown powder heroin from Mexico dominating the market west of the Mississippi. Retail-level heroin prices fell dramatically throughout the 1990s, with South American heroin being around 46% pure, Mexican heroin around 27% pure, and Southeast Asian and Southwest Asian heroin around 24% to 30% pure. Retail prices continued to decline through 2017, while purity, especially of Mexican heroin, has increased. Retail-level heroin prices continued to decline through 2017, with Mexican-sourced heroin dominating the U.S. market due to its proximity and reliable supply. Mexican transnational criminal organizations have increased production of white powder heroin, especially in the eastern U.S., while diversifying the heroin sold in western states. Concerns arise from the rising number of heroin seizures containing fentanyl and/or fentanyl-related substances. The rise of illicit nonpharmaceutical fentanyl from China, often mixed with or sold as heroin, is a major concern. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, with reported prices ranging between $30,000 and $38,000 per kilogram. Law enforcement expects illicit fentanyl distributors to create new products to evade laws. Illicit opioids come from plant-based and synthetic sources, with opium poppy crops illicitly cultivated worldwide. The United Nations estimates a decrease in illicit opium poppy cultivation worldwide in 2018, with Afghanistan being the largest producer. Mexico, Burma, Laos, and Colombia also reported cultivation. Illicit synthetic opioids may enter the market through various means. Illicit synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, are mostly foreign-sourced from countries like China, India, Mexico, Canada, and the Dominican Republic. These drugs may be produced in clandestine laboratories and the ingredients for prescription opioids can come from various countries. The majority of misused prescription opioids in the United States are prescribed for legitimate use and then diverted. Counterfeit prescription opioids are also available, often pressed into pills in the US or abroad and sold. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are major suppliers of illegal drugs smuggled into the US, increasing their share of the heroin market. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment highlights the influx of illicit heroin into the United States primarily through legal ports of entry, with heroin being co-mingled with legal goods in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers. Data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show significant seizures of heroin at ports of entry and between ports of entry. Fentanyl is primarily smuggled into the U.S. from China through various routes, with varying purity levels. The DEA notes that fentanyl is smuggled from China with high purity levels, while larger quantities with lower purity are transported from Mexico. Mexican traffickers often obtain fentanyl precursor chemicals from China and may adulterate fentanyl received from China before smuggling it into the United States. In FY2018, 1,785 pounds of fentanyl were seized at ports of entry, with the San Diego border sector being the primary entry point for fentanyl across the Southwest border. Most commonly, fentanyl is smuggled in personally operated vehicles. Multiple federal departments and agencies are involved in countering illicit opioid trafficking in the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in the United States is responsible for creating and implementing drug control policies to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking. The ONDCP director develops a National Drug Control Strategy and Budget to direct anti-drug efforts. The HIDTA program provides assistance to law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking areas. While ONDCP focuses on various drug threats, countering opioid-related threats is a major priority. The HIDTA program aims to reduce drug production and trafficking in critical drug trafficking areas through coordination, intelligence sharing, and enforcement strategies. HIDTA funds support initiatives targeting top drug trafficking threats in the region, such as heroin trafficking. ONDCP launched the Heroin Response Strategy in 2015 to develop partnerships among public safety and public health agencies at all levels to reduce drug trafficking. The Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) is a multi-disciplinary approach that aims to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt trafficking in illicit opioids through partnerships among public safety and public health agencies at all levels. The HRS coordinates teams of analysts and officers in each state, provides information on drug trafficking, and disseminates prevention activities. ONDCP collaborates with other agencies on counter-trafficking operations and recently launched the Opioid Detection Challenge. DOJ controls the opioid supply through law enforcement, regulation, and grants to state and local agencies. The DOJ controls the opioid supply through law enforcement initiatives targeting opioid trafficking. Various federal agencies participate in the OCDETF program to disrupt major drug trafficking organizations. This includes the DEA, FBI, ATF, U.S. Marshals, IRS, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard, and others collaborating with state and local law enforcement on task forces. There are 14 OCDETF strike forces nationwide and an OCDETF Fusion Center for intelligence gathering and analysis to support operations. During FY2018, 52% of active OCDETF investigations targeted heroin trafficking. The DEA enforces federal controlled substances laws nationwide and has a 360 Strategy to combat drug cartels, violent gangs, and opioid abuse. They utilize community-based enforcement and multijurisdictional task forces to address opioid trafficking, along with a heroin signature program (HSP). The DEA uses community-based enforcement strategies and multijurisdictional task forces to combat opioid trafficking. They operate heroin signature programs to identify the sources of heroin seized in the United States. The FBI investigates opioid trafficking as part of its efforts to counter organized crime, cybercriminals, and other malicious actors. The FBI participates in investigations targeting opioid distribution networks, including those using the Dark Web. Other DOJ agencies prosecute cases against prescribers, pharmaceutical companies, and pharmacies involved in illegal opioid activities. Enforcement agencies like the ATF and U.S. Marshals seize illicit opioids, while the Office of Justice Programs administers grant programs to address opioid supply and demand. CBP works to counter trafficking of illicit opioids along U.S. borders. CBP employs tools like nonintrusive inspection equipment, canines, and screening systems to detect and interdict illicit opioids at U.S. borders and POEs. Data show that most heroin and fentanyl seizures in FY2018 were made by CBP's Office of Field Operations at POEs. The Coast Guard focuses on interdicting noncommercial maritime flows of illegal drugs, primarily encountering cocaine. The Coast Guard's primary focus is interdicting noncommercial maritime flows of illegal drugs, with cocaine being the most common drug encountered. Other illicit drugs, such as opioids, are more commonly moved on land or in commercial maritime vessels. The USPIS, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service, has seen a significant increase in international and domestic parcel seizures related to opioids, dedicating more resources to investigating prohibited substances in the mail. In FY2018, USPIS and its partners seized over 96,000 pounds of drugs in the mail, including marijuana, methamphetamine, and synthetic opioids. The DEA plays a crucial role in regulating controlled substances in the United States, overseeing over 1.5 million registrants who handle these substances. Registrants must maintain detailed records, inventories, and reports with the DEA to ensure secure storage of controlled substances. The DEA regulates over 1.5 million registrants to prevent drug diversion, including prescription opioids. They use various authorities like inspections and quotas for controlled substances. Grant programs are discussed as potential solutions for the opioid epidemic. The DOJ administers grant programs focused on combating drug-related crime, including the COAP program which supports projects related to opioid abuse such as diversion programs, collaboration between agencies, overdose outreach, and interventions for justice-involved individuals. The Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is part of the COAP program, aiding law enforcement and public health officials in collecting and analyzing data on controlled substance prescriptions. It assists in investigations of illicit activities related to heroin and diverted prescription opioids, focusing on states with high rates of treatment admissions for these substances. The Drug Court Discretionary Grant program (Drug Courts Program) enhances drug court services for nonviolent substance-abusing offenders to reduce recidivism and substance abuse. It provides resources for state, local, and tribal courts to offer judicially supervised treatment, drug testing, community supervision, sanctions, and rehabilitation services. The program is not focused solely on opioid abusers but includes drug-involved offenders, including those abusing opioids. The Veterans Treatment Court Program, administered by BJA through the Drug Courts Program, serves veterans struggling with addiction, mental illness, and co-occurring disorders. Grants are awarded to establish and develop veterans treatment courts, with funding from the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. OJJDP supports juvenile and family drug court programs through its Drug Treatment Courts Program. The OJJDP supports juvenile and family drug court programs focusing on substance abuse issues, including opioid abuse and mental health disorders. The JAG program provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives at state, local, and tribal levels. The JMHCP program supports collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health systems to assist individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring disorders. It encourages early intervention, training for professionals, and collaborative support services. Grants under this program include approaches to reducing individuals with mental disorders in jail, planning and implementation, and expansion. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to provide formula grants to states for the development of juvenile delinquency programs and justice systems. These grants can be used for various programs, including substance abuse prevention. Discretionary grants are also available for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles at risk of entering the justice system. While none of the program areas specifically address opioid abuse, the grants are broad enough to potentially cover this issue. The Opioid Affected Youth Initiative and RSAT Program are grant programs that support efforts to combat opioid abuse among youth and in correctional facilities. The Opioid Affected Youth Initiative focuses on developing data-driven responses to address challenges from opioid abuse impacting youth and community safety. The RSAT Program supports substance abuse treatment programs in correctional facilities and reintegration services for offenders. The Department of Justice provides grants to support reintegration services for offenders reentering the community post-incarceration, with a focus on addressing opioid abuse reduction treatment. The COPS Office administers the Tribal Resources Grant Program to enhance tribal law enforcement's capacity for anti-opioid activities. The U.S. has a multipronged foreign policy approach to combat foreign flows of illicit opioids. The U.S. government engages in diplomacy and bilateral efforts to address drug control issues, including opioids, through international organizations like the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Efforts include promoting cross-border information sharing and incorporating new drugs into international drug control regimes. The U.S. government aims to accelerate the inclusion of new drugs and precursor chemicals into the U.N. international drug control regime. This includes advocating for the control of key chemical precursors like NPP and ANPP. The U.S. has also engaged in bilateral cooperation with countries like China, Mexico, and Canada to address opioid trafficking. Additionally, efforts have been made to improve global detection and interdiction of synthetic drugs shipped through international mail, although the Trump Administration announced a potential withdrawal from the Universal Postal Union in 2018. Bilateral cooperation on opioids with China, Mexico, and Canada includes structured dialogues, law enforcement cooperation, and foreign assistance programming. The U.S. prioritizes counternarcotics cooperation with China and Mexico through various diplomatic dialogues and meetings. Trilateral meetings between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada address heroin and fentanyl issues. U.S. federal law enforcement agencies also collaborate with their counterparts on ongoing investigations. The United States engages in structured dialogues and law enforcement cooperation with China and Mexico to address opioids. INL funding supports drug-related information exchanges and training in China, while efforts in Mexico focus on disrupting drug production and distribution networks. U.S. federal law enforcement agencies collaborate with their counterparts on ongoing investigations. The U.S. government works with China and Mexico to combat drug trafficking by disrupting production and distribution networks, prosecuting traffickers, and applying financial sanctions. Recent actions include indictments of Chinese nationals involved in fentanyl production and sanctions against individuals and entities trafficking heroin and fentanyl. The government of Mexico also cooperates in these efforts. The government of Mexico cooperates with the United States on counternarcotics efforts, including opioid supply reduction and international control of precursor chemicals. In 2018, Mexico increased its budget for public security and formed an Office of National Drug Policy. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador continues cooperation with the U.S. on drug control. Observers suggest potential collaboration in combating fentanyl smuggling. The Mexican government cooperates with the United States on drug control, including efforts to combat fentanyl smuggling. The Mexican military leads eradication of illicit drug crops, seizing significant amounts of opium gum. The United States has provided training and equipment that led to increased fentanyl seizures in Mexico. Mexican law enforcement discovered a carfentanil production mill in 2018. China remains a primary source of illicit fentanyl destined for the United States. China is a primary source of illicit fentanyl destined for the United States. China has imposed controls on fentanyl analogues and precursor chemicals, leading to a decrease in availability in the US. President Xi Jinping expressed willingness to further control fentanyl substances, supported by President Trump. In April 2019, China announced that all fentanyl-related substances would be added to the country's list of controlled narcotic drugs. Li Yuejin outlined additional steps China would take, including issuing guidance on laws and protocols for handling criminal cases related to fentanyl substances. China announced additional steps to combat illicit fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking, including investigating manufacturing bases, scrubbing drug-related content from the Internet, cutting off online communication channels for criminals, and strengthening international cooperation to dismantle drug smuggling networks. The DEA and ONDCP welcomed China's efforts to eliminate drug traffickers' ability to alter fentanyl compounds. China's scheduling decision does not cover all precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, allowing them to flow to Mexico for production. China has cracked down on illicit fentanyl rings and assisted DOJ investigations. Congress has addressed the opioid crisis with a public health approach and enacted laws focusing on prevention, treatment, and supply control. Three major laws were enacted in the 114th and 115th Congresses to combat the opioid epidemic. The Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), 21st Century Cures Act, and SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act were key legislative responses to the opioid crisis. These laws focused on prevention, treatment, and supply control, with funding allocated for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities. Congress and the Administration provided specific funds to address opioid abuse in FY2017-FY2019 appropriations, including $347.0 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. In FY2019, additional funding was allocated to various agencies to combat drug trafficking, including heroin and fentanyl. This funding will support the addition of new heroin enforcement teams and DEA 360 Strategy programming. Other opioid-specific funding includes initiatives for opioid-affected youth, tribal law enforcement, anti-heroin task forces, CBP for opioid detection, and Homeland Security Investigations for additional personnel. In FY2019, additional funding was allocated to combat drug trafficking, including heroin and fentanyl. This funding supported new heroin enforcement teams, DEA 360 Strategy programming, initiatives for opioid-affected youth, tribal law enforcement, anti-heroin task forces, CBP for opioid detection, and Homeland Security Investigations for additional personnel. Specific funding amounts were allocated for laboratory personnel, port of entry technology, canine personnel, and support staff for opioid detection, as well as for DHS research and development related to opioids/fentanyl, and ONDCP for Community-based Coalition Enhancement Grants to Address Local Drug Crises. States have adapted their criminal justice responses to the opioid epidemic by increasing law enforcement officer access to naloxone to reduce overdose deaths. Over 2,400 police departments in 42 states reported officers carrying naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses. Over 2,400 police departments in 42 states reported officers carrying naloxone to combat fentanyl and heroin trafficking. States have expanded access to naloxone and provided immunity to those who possess, dispense, or administer the drug, offering legal protections from arrest or prosecution. State and local law enforcement coordinate special operations to dismantle trafficking networks in areas with high opioid overdose rates. For example, a recent investigation in southeast Massachusetts led to 11 arrests in a \"highly organized and complex\" fentanyl network. The investigation in southeast Massachusetts resulted in 11 arrests led by the Bristol Country District Attorney's office and involved multiple law enforcement agencies. Good Samaritan laws encourage seeking medical attention for overdoses without fear of prosecution. States have drug diversion programs and drug courts to address opioid abuse, with some expanding options in response to the epidemic. The National Governors Association has supported states in combating the opioid crisis. The National Governors Association has sponsored activities to combat the opioid epidemic, including developing best practices for opioid abuse treatment in justice-involved populations. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction recommended establishing drug courts in every county. States have enacted legislation to increase access to medication-assisted treatment for drug-addicted offenders in criminal justice settings. SAMHSA released guidance on increasing MAT availability in these settings."
