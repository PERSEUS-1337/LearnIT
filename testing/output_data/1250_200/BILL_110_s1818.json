    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress recognizes the highly toxic nature of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It acknowledges the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies due to mercury exposure, primarily from contaminated fish consumption. The long-term solution to mercury pollution involves minimizing global mercury use and releases to reduce environmental contamination levels. Mercury pollution is a transboundary issue, with significant amounts used in mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide. Mercury pollution from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants is a transboundary issue, affecting bodies of water globally. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants use the obsolete mercury cell process, with cost-effective alternatives available for the remaining 90 percent of production. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell process. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the contamination of products with mercury and the release of mercury from using these products. Despite the known use of mercury, there is a lack of accountability for its disposition and accurate estimation of current mercury emissions. It is crucial for the US to work towards minimizing mercury supply, demand, and releases both domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to reduce mercury use and emissions in the US, including from existing mercury reservoirs, to minimize exposures, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, a new section is added to the Toxic Substances Control Act to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report mercury-containing hazardous waste generated annually to the Administrator and the State. The chlor-alkali facility must report hazardous waste and mercury content, waste management details, mercury release into air or water, mercury accumulation in equipment, and forms of mercury in products produced for sale. The chlor-alkali facility must report the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale. The Administrator may allow combining this report with other required reports to avoid duplication. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within a year, considering mercury purchased, used, and remaining in the facility. The chlor-alkali facility must report mercury quantities in products for sale. The Administrator obtains records to determine mercury releases into the environment. A Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established. The establishment of a Mercury Storage Advisory Committee with 9 members, including appointments by the Speaker of the House and the Secretary of Defense, is detailed. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will consist of 9 members, including the Administrator, Secretary of Defense, State environmental agencies representative, State attorneys general representative, chlorine industry representative, mercury waste treatment industry representative, and a nonprofit environmental organization representative. Appointments for members (iv) through (viii) must be made within 45 days of the section's enactment. The Committee, appointed by congressional committees, will hold an initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. A report on environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of enactment. The report must include details on worker exposure and storage costs of elemental mercury, optimal size and number of Federal facilities for storage, estimated quantities resulting from discontinuing mercury cells, and other supplies needed for implementation over a 40-year period. The report will cover the estimated quantity of elemental mercury generated from recycling, barriers to private sector storage, advantages of consolidating storage, and the optimal plan for storing excess mercury from public and private sources. The Committee will address the compensation of members, including non-federal employees and federal employees, outlining the daily pay rates for their engagement in Committee duties. The Committee members, whether federal employees or not, will serve without additional compensation for their duties. They will be reimbursed for travel expenses at authorized rates. The Administrator will provide necessary funding and personnel for the Committee to carry out its duties. The Committee will receive funding and personnel to perform its duties and will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring and storing mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities must be established by July 1, 2008. Mercury at closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. A health assessment must be completed by July 1, 2009. The Administrator, in coordination with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, will conduct a health assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2009. Additionally, the Administrator may promulgate regulations necessary to carry out this section. The Administrator may regulate the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
