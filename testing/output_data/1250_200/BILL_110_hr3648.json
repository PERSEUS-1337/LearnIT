The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excludes qualified principal residence indebtedness discharged before January 1, 2010 from gross income. Special rules apply to reduce the basis of the taxpayer's principal residence. The term 'qualified principal residence indebtedness' refers to acquisition indebtedness with respect to the taxpayer's principal residence. Exceptions apply for discharges not related to the taxpayer's financial condition, and an ordering rule determines the application of subsection (a)(1)(E) to discharged loans. The amendments made by this section apply to discharges of indebtedness on or after January 1, 2007. Coordination changes are made to section 108(a)(2) and 108(a) of the Code, with the principal residence exclusion taking precedence over the insolvency exclusion unless elected otherwise. SEC. 3 extends the treatment of mortgage insurance premiums as interest until December 31, 2010. The effective date for this amendment is after December 31, 2007. SEC. 4 introduces alternative tests for qualifying as a cooperative housing corporation. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines the requirements for a cooperative housing corporation, including deriving 80% or more of gross income from tenant-stockholders, using 80% or more of property for residential purposes, and having 90% or more of expenditures benefit tenant-stockholders. The amendment applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act, regarding expenses for the corporation's property benefiting tenant-stockholders. SEC. 5. EXCLUSION FROM INCOME FOR BENEFITS PROVIDED TO VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONDERS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude benefits provided to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders from gross income. In the case of qualified volunteer emergency response organization members, gross income excludes qualified State and local tax benefits and qualified payments. Deductions and expenses are adjusted accordingly to prevent double benefits. Qualified state and local tax benefits refer to tax reductions provided for services as a volunteer. Members of qualified volunteer emergency response organizations can receive qualified payments from States or political divisions for services rendered. The maximum amount for such payments in a taxable year is $30 multiplied by the number of months the taxpayer performs services. These organizations must be organized to provide firefighting or emergency medical services and have a written agreement with the State. Members of qualified volunteer emergency response organizations can receive qualified payments from States or political subdivisions for providing firefighting or emergency medical services. This section does not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2010. Members of volunteer emergency response organizations can receive benefits. Amendments apply to taxable years after December 31, 2007. Clarification on student housing eligible for low-income housing credit is provided.

It also addresses the joint return limitation for capital gains exclusion on post-marriage sales of principal residences by surviving spouses. SEC. 7 amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow surviving spouses to exclude up to $500,000 from capital gains on the sale of their principal residence within 2 years of their spouse's death. This change applies to sales after December 31, 2007. SEC. 8 modifies penalties for failure to file partnership returns and limits disclosure. SEC. 8 amends the Internal Revenue Code by extending the time limitation for filing partnership returns to 12 months and increasing the penalty amount to $85. It also limits the disclosure of taxpayer returns to certain entities, excluding taxpayer identity information of individuals not related to the entity or the inspection. The amendment restricts the disclosure of taxpayer identity information to entities conducting inspections or making returns. It will take effect upon the enactment of the Act. SEC. 9. PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FILE S CORPORATION RETURNS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section imposing penalties for failure to file S corporation returns. The penalty for failure to file S corporation returns under the Internal Revenue Code includes a penalty for not filing on time or providing required information, with a monthly penalty not exceeding 12 months. The penalty amount is $85 multiplied by the number of shareholders in the S corporation. The penalty is assessed against the S corporation and is not subject to deficiency procedures. The penalty for failure to file S corporation returns under the Internal Revenue Code is assessed against the S corporation. Deficiency procedures do not apply to the assessment or collection of this penalty. The penalty for failure to file S corporation returns is addressed in Section 6699, with amendments applying to returns after the enactment date.
