    "content": "Climate change has received significant policy attention internationally and in the United States. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2013 report highlighted evidence of climate warming, raising concerns about severe and rapid changes with catastrophic consequences. The National Academies emphasize that no single strategy or country can solve the climate change challenge. Mitigation efforts focus on reducing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, emitted through natural processes and human activities. Adaptation activities aim to enhance resilience to climate change impacts and capitalize on potential benefits. Adaptation activities aim to improve coping with climate change impacts and taking advantage of potential benefits. Concerns exist that current strategies may not prevent extreme disruptions, leading to suggestions for geoengineering as an additional method. Geoengineering technologies aim to modify the Earth's energy balance to counteract climate change, raising environmental and ethical concerns. Proposed technologies vary in characteristics and consequences, classified into solar radiation. Proposed geoengineering technologies are classified into Solar radiation management (SRM) and Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. SRM methods aim to increase Earth's reflectivity, while CDR methods focus on removing CO2 and other GHGs from the atmosphere. SRM methods could have immediate climate impacts, but if they fail, global warming could resume rapidly. Some SRM methods are already being deployed, while CDR methods include afforestation and ocean fertilization. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) did not mention geoengineering before 2013. However, in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013, they addressed geoengineering methods for the first time. These methods aim to alter the climate system to counter climate change, but there is limited evidence for their effectiveness. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods have limitations on a global scale, while Solar Radiation Management (SRM) methods have the potential to offset global warming if realizable. Modeling shows that SRM methods could offset global temperature rise but would impact the water cycle and not address ocean acidification. There are risks associated with scaling SRM, as abrupt termination could lead to rapid temperature increases. Both CDR and SRM have global side effects and long-term consequences. Legislative action on geoengineering has not been taken by the 112th or 113th Congress. In 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee of the 111th Congress discussed the environmental risks and benefits of geoengineering. Some foreign governments and scientists are also exploring geoengineering options. Some foreign governments and scientists, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and India, are considering geoengineering technologies due to concerns over slow emissions reductions, climate uncertainties, and the impact of aggressive GHG mitigation strategies. Congressional interest in geoengineering focuses on its effectiveness for addressing climate change. Deployment of geoengineering technologies may raise new concerns about government oversight, transboundary effects, and long-term impacts. In 2012, an American citizen conducted a geoengineering experiment off the west coast of Canada, sparking international debate. In the summer of 2012, an American citizen conducted a geoengineering experiment off the west coast of Canada, sparking international debate. Geoengineering technologies aim to modify the Earth's energy balance to counteract climate change through deliberate modifications. The report discusses policy issues, science, and governance of geoengineering technologies, including governmental involvement and oversight. Geoengineering technologies require global input for implementation and control varies by technology type. Research on geoengineering methods is limited, with minimal deployment through field tests or commercial ventures. More research is needed to assess feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and potential impacts before deployment. Policymakers are considering the need for governmental oversight in the short and long term to guide research and potential deployment. Governance structures could either support or constrain geoengineering activities based on policymakers' decisions. Uncertainties remain regarding risk factors and governance questions as technological development and policy considerations are still in early stages. Geoengineering technologies are in early stages, raising questions about governance and risk factors. Policy considerations include the need for government oversight, responsibility, and funding for research and development. Uncertainties exist in the social, ethical, legal, and political aspects of geoengineering deployment. The social, ethical, legal, and political uncertainties associated with geoengineering activities pose a greater risk. Government oversight mechanisms should be established before promoting geoengineering technologies. Uncertainties make it unclear which methods may mature sufficiently for deployment. Significant risk factors include the Technology Control Dilemma, where risks can only be resolved through research and development. Anticipating the evolution of new technology can be challenging, making oversight and risk management difficult once widely deployed. Anticipating the evolution of new technology can be challenging, making oversight and risk management difficult once widely deployed. Flexibility is needed to support investigative research and constrain harmful deployment. Risk mitigation relies on the ability to cease a technology program and terminate its adverse effects quickly. Reversibility is crucial in geoengineering options, but secondary effects may not end immediately. Choices made regarding geoengineering methods can impact other social, economic, and technological decisions related to climate science. Investing in geoengineering options instead of reducing GHG emissions could have adverse effects like ocean acidification, biodiversity stress, and climate sensitivity shocks. Encapsulation of technology plays a role in risk mitigation, with non-encapsulated geoengineering technologies posing uncertainties and policy challenges. Encapsulated technologies may still have localized environmental impacts. Encapsulated geoengineering technologies may have localized environmental impacts, requiring regulatory action to address indirect impacts on agro-forestry, species, and habitats. Private-sector involvement in geoengineering development could lead to innovation but may neglect risk assessments. Public subsidies or GHG emission pricing may be needed to encourage investment in commercial geoengineering projects. Public engagement is crucial for the future of geoengineering technologies, as public attitudes, perceptions of risks, trust levels, transparency, liabilities, and compensation all play a significant role in the political feasibility of these activities. Dialogue between scientists, policymakers, and the public is necessary for public acceptance, as the consequences of geoengineering activities have implications at both national and international levels. Geoengineering activities' acceptance depends on scientific, social, legal, and political factors. Public opinion is evolving and varies by technology. The UK's Royal Society identified three perspectives on geoengineering deployment. The scientific community holds three perspectives on geoengineering technologies: it is seen as dangerous and unethical, as an insurance policy for mitigation failure, or as a way to buy time during international negotiations. Various technologies have been proposed to address climate change, ranging from planting trees for carbon sequestration to launching mirrors into space for sunlight reflection. These technologies are still in the theoretical or research phase and lack widespread support. Geoengineering technologies, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM), require significant funding and lack widespread support. CDR methods aim to cool the planet by removing CO2 from the atmosphere through various means such as afforestation and ocean fertilization. The duration of carbon storage varies depending on the method used. Carbon storage duration varies depending on the approach, lasting from decades to thousands of years. CDR techniques take longer to impact climate change compared to SRM techniques. While CDR methods may be easier to govern, they are not ideal for immediate climate alteration. Some well-examined CDR methods include carbon capture and sequestration, ocean fertilization, afforestation, and enhanced weathering. CCS involves capturing and storing CO2 to prevent its release into the atmosphere. CCS technology aims to capture and store CO2 from anthropogenic sources like biomass, bioenergy, and fossil fuels to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The distinction of labeling CCS as a geoengineering technology depends on the carbon source, with biomass and bioenergy considered carbon-neutral or carbon-negative. Additional intervention could increase CO2 sequestration by burying biomass in land or the deep ocean. Large-scale carbon capture using biomass can sequester CO2 by burying biomass in land or the deep ocean, or by pyrolyzing biomass into biochar. This process requires a steady biomass supply and storage space. CCS technology for fossil fuels has not been deployed commercially due to costs and regulatory requirements, but there are incentives to incorporate CCS into new power plant designs. The policy incentives for incorporating CCS into new power plant design may change due to limits on CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide capture has been done on a small scale for commercial purposes, but large-scale sequestration for climate change mitigation is still in development. Estimates suggest it may take 10-15 years before CCS for fossil fuels is commercially viable. Bioenergy generation coupled with CO2 capture and sequestration (BECS) involves planting biomass crops, harvesting for biofuel production, and storing the captured carbon. BECS technology is similar to CCS technology used for fossil fuels. BECS is an unproven method of capturing CO2 from biomass used for electricity generation, with potential for sequestering CO2 in geologic formations. Deployment challenges include the lack of a regulatory framework for geologic sequestration and the need for an integrated structure to address ownership, leakage, liability, monitoring, and infrastructure for CO2 sequestration. Deployment timelines for BECS could be as long as fossil-fuel CCS, with concerns about its impact on climate change. Some concerns regarding carbon capture and storage (CCS) include liability for CO2 leaks, the need for a monitoring and maintenance plan, and the development of a dedicated pipeline infrastructure. There are debates about the impact of CCS on reducing fossil fuel use and the potential contamination of underground water sources. The U.S. EPA has established regulations for geologic sequestration of CO2. Ocean fertilization is another method to enhance carbon sequestration by phytoplankton in the deep ocean. Ocean fertilization involves phytoplankton photosynthesizing CO2 and sequestering carbon in the deep ocean. Adding iron to certain ocean areas could remove significant amounts of carbon from the air. However, the ecological, economic, and climatological impacts of ocean fertilization are uncertain, with concerns about ocean acidification, greenhouse gas emissions, and oxygen reduction. Critics argue that ocean fertilization may not be an effective long-term solution for combating climate change. Ocean fertilization involves adding iron to certain ocean areas to sequester carbon through phytoplankton photosynthesis. However, studies have not proven its long-term effectiveness as a carbon sequestration strategy, and there are concerns about its impact on marine ecosystems. Afforestation, on the other hand, involves planting trees on deforested sites to sequester carbon. Both methods are being considered for carbon offsetting, but legal frameworks for ocean fertilization are currently lacking. Afforestation is a key strategy for carbon sequestration, storing 10 times more carbon than non-forest communities for decades to hundreds of years. It also provides benefits like erosion control, wildlife habitat, and modifying local climates. Challenges include measuring carbon storage, landowners' reluctance, and potential drawbacks like CO2 releases from forested lands due to natural events. Afforestation is a recognized method for carbon sequestration, with the potential to store significant amounts of CO2 over time. The process involves planting trees on marginal croplands, with estimated sequestration potential ranging from 2.2 to 9.5 metric tons of CO2 per acre per year. It may take at least 20 years to see the full carbon sequestration benefits, depending on tree growth rates. There is ongoing debate about whether carbon accumulation continues or peaks when additional wood growth is minimal. Afforestation projects typically occur on marginal croplands, with potential for converting millions of acres of U.S. agricultural land to woodlands by 2050. Climate changes may influence the choice of forestry species planted at these sites. The cost of such projects can range from $65 to $200 per acre. Enhanced weathering, a method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, involves spreading crushed olivine on agricultural land, but there is limited literature on its implementation and environmental impacts. Enhanced weathering projects involve spreading crushed olivine on agricultural and forested lands to sequester CO2 and improve soil quality. This method requires mining, grinding, and transporting large amounts of rocks, with potential environmental consequences and the need for additional resources like energy and water. Barriers to this technology include scale, cost, energy requirements, and potential long-term impacts on air and water quality. Solar radiation management methods aim to reduce incoming solar radiation by enhancing albedo, without affecting GHG emission rates. Decisions need to be made on landscape alterations, disposal of disintegrated material, and project funding. Solar radiation management (SRM) methods aim to increase Earth's reflectivity (albedo) to reduce incoming solar radiation. These methods include land-based, cloud-based, stratosphere-based, and spaced-based approaches. The effectiveness of SRM depends on location, altitude of application, and atmospheric properties. SRM could be deployed faster than carbon dioxide removal methods in case of urgent need. However, SRM methods are theoretical, unproven on a large scale, and could have unforeseen consequences. Research and oversight programs are suggested to evaluate SRM technologies before potential hasty deployment. Some commentators advocate for research to improve understanding of the feasibility, opportunities, and limitations of different SRM approaches in climate change mitigation. Others argue for constraints on SRM research due to significant environmental risks, such as system failure, changes in climate patterns, ozone depletion, and diversion from more permanent solutions. Earth's atmosphere may extend the lifetime of potent non-CO2 greenhouse gases, diverting focus from permanent emission reduction solutions. Societies considering SRM techniques for quick relief may invest less in long-term solutions. Concerns about unknown effects of large-scale geoengineering exist due to Earth's climate history showing abrupt changes from small alterations. Some widely discussed SRM techniques include enhanced albedo, aerosol injection, and space-based reflectors. Increasing surface reflectivity, or albedo, can limit temperature increases by directing more solar radiation back to space. Urban areas are a key target for enhancing surface albedo, with methods like painting roofs and paved areas white estimated to cost several billion. Enhancing surface albedo in urban areas, such as painting roofs and paved areas white, can save on energy costs but may lead to drawbacks like glare and reduced winter heat gains. Aggressively pursuing increased reflectivity may decrease the use of asphalt. Genetic engineering of plants is being considered to enhance albedo with low costs, but it may take a decade for implementation. Genetic engineering and ocean surface coverage are proposed methods to enhance albedo. Cloud whitening, involving the dispersion of cloud-condensation nuclei, is another suggested approach. Concerns exist about the impact on aquatic life and marine ecosystems. Further research is needed to understand the long-term implications of these methods. The implications of deploying cloud whitening are not fully understood, with potential disturbances to marine ecosystems. Further research is needed for spray generator development and to assess impacts on ocean currents and precipitation patterns. Aerosol injection involves dispersing aerosols into the stratosphere to cool the Earth, mimicking volcanic eruptions. The cost for sulfur particle injection using airplanes is estimated to be several billion dollars annually, but testing is required to validate theoretical predictions. Aerosol injection aims to mimic large volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in 1991 to cool the Earth, but testing is needed to validate predictions. The cooling effects are temporary, requiring multiple injections over decades or centuries to offset greenhouse gas warming. Benefits include potential ice melting reduction, but risks include uneven global distribution, drought in Africa and Asia, GHG emissions from aerosol transport, ozone depletion, and weakening of ecosystems. Space-based reflectors are a theoretical geoengineering proposal to reduce incoming solar radiation. The shields would vary in design, material, location, and maintenance. Materials suggested include lunar glass, aluminum thread netting, metallic reflecting disks, and refracting disks. Locations could be low Earth orbit or Lagrange point 1 (L1). Further research is needed on costs, implementation steps, maintenance, disposal, and ecological impacts. Deployment for global or regional climate alteration and the science behind reflectors remain unanswered questions. The use of space-based reflectors for geoengineering to reduce solar radiation is still in question. Uncertainties remain regarding the deployment scale, maturity of the science, construction timeline, and potential costs. Policy decisions on pursuing or restricting geoengineering research and deployment will be influenced by various factors, including social, legal, political, and technical considerations. Government oversight of geoengineering activities is a topic of debate, with potential responses being discussed. Government oversight of geoengineering activities is a topic of debate, with one possible response being to maintain the status quo, which involves modest funding for research, limited regulation, and a lack of comprehensive oversight. Advocates of this approach believe that private industry is best suited to drive innovation in geoengineering, and that current regulations on greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to incentivize market development in climate engineering. Advocates of maintaining the status quo argue that current research and funding in marine and atmospheric science, carbon capture, and adaptation strategies are sufficient for technological transformation. They believe that increased government intervention in geoengineering research could hinder progress and limit innovation. Additionally, there are concerns that public opinion and engagement may be negative towards the uncertainties and costs associated with geoengineering. If governments choose not to implement new laws or treaties regarding geoengineering, they would essentially endorse the current approach. Advocates of maintaining the status quo argue that current research and funding in marine and atmospheric science, carbon capture, and adaptation strategies are sufficient for technological transformation. If policymakers decide to address geoengineering more aggressively, one possible policy proposal will entail creating a system for government oversight of both research and deployment of geoengineering technologies. The question of when governments should intervene to monitor or regulate geoengineering activities will be key for determining an appropriate system of oversight. Observers have suggested criteria for determining the point at which geoengineering activities should become subject to a larger system of oversight or regulation, including the extent of transboundary or international impacts. The assessment of geoengineering impacts may require scientific and political insight. Suggestions include setting up an international panel process for experts to provide insight to policymakers. Critics argue for the inclusion of social scientists, ethics analysts, and the public in the evaluation process. Another suggestion is to evaluate research and deployment activities similar to the National Environmental Policy Act. Governments should evaluate geoengineering research and deployment activities similar to the National Environmental Policy Act. Different policies may be needed to address concerns about the new and uncertain technology, its broad stakeholder impact, and the global benefits and risks. The global impacts of geoengineering activities, including benefits and risks, may be unevenly distributed across stakeholders. Different technologies and environments for research and deployment may require varying oversight methods. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies may be governed by existing U.S. laws, while different methods are needed for air capture, biochar, biomass sequestration, and enhanced terrestrial weathering. Ecosystem impacts of enhanced weathering would likely stay within national boundaries, but ocean-based CDR technologies may pose international governance challenges. Enhanced terrestrial weathering would likely be contained within national boundaries, while ocean-based CDR technologies could cause non-trivial effects across national boundaries. Different stages of geoengineering development require flexible regulatory frameworks to cover the full cycle. Many scientists emphasize the need for oversight methods to address the significant transboundary effects of most SRM technologies. Geoengineering research activities and full-scale deployment require flexible regulatory frameworks to cover the full cycle. Oversight methods need to address transboundary effects, with different environments requiring different oversight approaches. International cooperation is essential for regulating uses of high seas, transboundary and upper atmosphere, and outer space. Some advocate for a moratorium or ban on geoengineering research and deployment due to uncertain science, potential adverse effects, distraction from mitigation goals, and misuse by governments or industry. However, others argue against such actions, stating they would hinder research progress. Some argue against a moratorium or ban on geoengineering technologies, stating that it would inhibit research progress and deter responsible parties from developing the technology. The jurisdiction of domestic laws and international treaties over geoengineering activities is unclear, leading to debates on government oversight and the need for new legal frameworks to support coordinated research. In response to debates on government oversight and the need for new legal frameworks to support coordinated research, suggestions have been made for enacting new legal frameworks to regulate geoengineering activities. The governance of geoengineering activities in the United States could involve states developing their own policies, leveraging the potential for regulatory innovation and experimentation at the state level. The potential impacts of geoengineering activities across state boundaries may require a more comprehensive federal approach. The potential impacts of geoengineering activities across state and regional boundaries may require a more comprehensive federal policy. State involvement in geoengineering policy diversity may hinder private actors who prefer operating under a single set of laws. U.S. government efforts in developing policies for emerging technologies like nuclear science and nanotechnology could provide insights for effective geoengineering policies. Emerging high-risk technologies like geoengineering often face challenges in obtaining private sector financing and research support. Emerging high-risk technologies, such as geoengineering, may struggle to secure private sector financing due to uncertainties and lack of incentives. Public subsidies may be necessary to support their development. Regulatory concerns include potential hazards and unintended consequences, requiring constraints or bans to protect public health and safety. Geoengineering activities may require regulatory controls similar to hazardous materials. Existing federal laws could be expanded or new laws developed to address geoengineering practices. Some activities, like carbon dioxide sequestration, may already be affected by laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Air Act. The EPA has issued draft rules to regulate CO2 under the Safe Water Drinking Act. The EPA has issued draft rules to regulate CO2 under the Safe Water Drinking Act and the Clean Air Act. The 111th Congress considered amending the Clean Air Act to broaden the EPA's authority for regulations related to geologic sequestration and ocean fertilization under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) authorizes NOAA and the EPA to conduct research on ocean resources and phase out ocean disposal activities. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the EPA to adjust phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances and regulate substances that harm the stratosphere. Some states are developing their own policies to address geoengineering activities. Some states are developing their own policies to address geoengineering activities, while federal agencies have not dedicated significant efforts or funding towards national geoengineering policies. Officials from interagency bodies coordinating the U.S. response to climate change stated that there is no coordinated research strategy or position on geoengineering. Policymakers may consider involving multiple agencies and entities with different expertise in the development and implementation of national geoengineering policies. The curr_chunk discusses the different legislative authorities and areas of expertise that various federal agencies and entities offer in the development and implementation of national policies on geoengineering. It also outlines six categories of authorized functions that these entities can perform, such as research, information exchange, funding, monitoring, regulation promulgation, and enforcement. Selected agencies and entities with legislative authority in these areas are listed in Table 2. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a single federal entity with the authority to address all aspects of geoengineering technologies. It suggests the possibility of international agreements to supplement existing treaties and enhance transparency, enforcement, and research in the field. The strengths and weaknesses of international treaties lie in their conservative nature, where nations adjust commitments to ensure compliance. Developing international consensus on norms can be challenging due to cultural, political, and economic diversity, leading to potential stalemates. Some suggest a moratorium on geoengineering activities as the only feasible norm at this stage. The challenges of implementing international agreements on geoengineering include difficulties in monitoring and enforcing compliance, concerns about sovereignty, and limitations in resolving disputes between countries and private actors. Countries may see advantages in coordinating a global plan for geoengineering activities, but local and national laws may still be necessary. No multilateral treaty has been proposed for geoengineering, but existing international agreements and customary international law may apply. Governments may need to consider these principles when developing an international approach to geoengineering. Customary international law dictates that countries have a duty not to cause significant transboundary harm, which could be relevant to geoengineering projects. It also influences how countries interpret international agreements, such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties establishes that signatories must adhere to international agreements unless they clearly state otherwise. Non-parties to a treaty are not bound by its obligations. International agreements on climate change, like the UNFCCC, are important for geoengineering projects as they promote policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UNFCCC, signed in 1992 and in force since 1994, requires parties to share information on GHG emissions, develop national strategies, and cooperate on adaptation. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 and in force since 2005, mandates high-income parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until 2012. The US is a party to the UNFCCC but not the Kyoto Protocol. The United States is a party to the UNFCCC but not the Kyoto Protocol. The CBD allows countries to exploit their resources but also holds them responsible for preventing environmental damage. The COP to the CBD has called for abstaining from geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity unless risks are fully considered. The COP to the CBD has affirmed its decision regarding ocean fertilization activities and requested that Parties ensure activities are based on adequate scientific basis. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs activities on the world's oceans and defines countries' jurisdictions and rights of access. The UNCLOS establishes a legal regime governing activities on the world's oceans, including measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment. It defines pollution as any human-driven introduction of substances or energy that harms marine life or sea water quality. Countries have a duty to control and limit pollution under Article 194, while Article 192 imposes a general obligation to protect the marine environment. The UNCLOS imposes obligations on member countries to protect the marine environment and control pollution. Ocean fertilization and geoengineering activities must not have a negative impact on the marine ecosystem. The London Convention and London Protocol aim to prevent marine pollution by dumping substances that could harm human health or marine life. The London Convention and London Protocol aim to prevent marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of substances that could harm human health, marine life, or interfere with legitimate uses of the sea. However, certain geoengineering projects may not be subject to these prohibitions if they serve a purpose other than disposal. Recent amendments and resolutions have addressed specific geoengineering technologies, such as sub-seabed geological sequestration of carbon dioxide. The parties adopted Resolution LC-LP.1 in 2008, stating that ocean fertilization research activities do not constitute dumping under the London Convention and Protocol. The use of SRM technologies may implicate the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), which aims to prohibit the military or hostile use of techniques that manipulate natural processes to cause widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects on the Earth. The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) aims to limit and reduce air pollutants to combat transboundary pollution. Parties to the Convention can exchange scientific information on environmental modification techniques for peaceful purposes. The United States became a party to the Convention in 1979. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, along with the Montreal Protocol, aims to control ozone-depleting substances. The United States is a party to both agreements and has agreed to all amendments. The regulation of geoengineering activities under CLRTAP is uncertain. The Montreal Protocol, in effect since 1988, requires parties to cooperate in understanding and controlling activities that harm the ozone layer. Certain geoengineering technologies may impact the Protocol's phase-out provisions. No international organization currently addresses all geoengineering activities, but existing institutions could potentially be adapted for this purpose. Assessing the ideal structure of an international institution for geoengineering activities is challenging due to limited understanding of the technologies. Factors to consider include functions, membership, resources, jurisdiction, and voting rules for decision-making. Some suggest modifying existing international bodies rather than creating new ones. Some suggest that a multilateral body like the United Nations or its specialized agencies, such as UNEP or IMO, would be best suited for overseeing global geoengineering activities. These institutions have international reach, existing resources, legitimacy, and experience in consensus-building. However, the U.N. process is slow and complex, which may hinder effective oversight. Some critics argue that involving a multilateral body in geoengineering oversight may lead to mission creep and conflicts of interest. They suggest that existing institutions may be biased against geoengineering or allocate insufficient resources to it. Alternatively, plurilateral or ad hoc bodies like the G-20 or MEF could facilitate dialogue and coordination among countries with shared characteristics. The involvement of international organizations in geoengineering oversight may face challenges such as limited membership undermining legitimacy and demands for representation from excluded countries. Intergovernmental organizations like the International Energy Association act as policy advisors on energy security and environmental protection, including carbon capture and sequestration. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a network of national standards institutes from 163 countries, developing international standards in response to sector needs. While the ISO has not yet created standards for geoengineering, it has established standards for air and water quality. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has not developed comprehensive standards for geoengineering activities but has created standards for air and water quality. International research consortia can play a key role in setting research priorities, evaluating feasibility, coordinating research, providing oversight, and developing codes of practice for emerging technologies. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a code of practice to govern research in emerging geoengineering technology, emphasizing transparency and collaboration among international consortia. It suggests engaging experts and stakeholders to explore safe and effective geoengineering methods while building a community of responsible researchers. The chunk also highlights the importance of developing international policy norms based on evolving knowledge and experience in geoengineering technologies. Currently, there is no collaborative mechanism applicable to geoengineering, unlike in organizations such as CERN and the Human Genome Project. International bodies overseeing geoengineering may lack the authority to fully regulate or enforce compliance with their terms. For example, the International Court of Justice relies on member cooperation to enforce its judgments, with the option to involve the U.N. Security Council if necessary. The World Trade Organization operates similarly in resolving disputes among its members. Geoengineering, an emerging field, requires careful deliberation by policymakers and potential development or amendment of international agreements, laws, or regulations. International institutions like the ICJ and WTO can persuade compliance, but ultimately rely on negotiations and diplomacy for universal adherence to agreements. Currently, geoengineering technologies are in the conceptual and research stages, with limited studies on their cost, environmental effects, and legal implications. Despite interest from some foreign governments and private entities due to slow progress in greenhouse gas reductions, there is limited federal involvement in the United States. Deployment of geoengineering technologies could have significant transboundary effects. In the United States, there is limited federal involvement in geoengineering, leading to a piecemeal approach by federal agencies and states. Possible federal approaches include leaving policy development to agencies and states, imposing moratoriums on certain technologies, developing national policies, or collaborating internationally. The government has historically played a role in advancing new technologies like nanotechnology and genetic engineering."
