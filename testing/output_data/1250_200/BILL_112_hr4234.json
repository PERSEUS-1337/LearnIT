    "content": "The \"Grazing Improvement Act of 2012\" amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to extend grazing permits and leases from 10 to 20 years. It also includes provisions for the completion of environmental analysis before issuing permits or leases. Additionally, the Act addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases. The \"Grazing Improvement Act of 2012\" defines current grazing management and the Secretary concerned. It also addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases under specific sections. The renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases are governed by specific sections such as section 402, the Granger-Thye Act, the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, and the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. The terms and conditions of expired permits or leases continue until processing is completed by the Secretary concerned, in compliance with applicable laws. Permits or leases may be cancelled, suspended, or modified as per applicable law. The Secretary concerned may renew or reissue a permit or lease for 20 years after processing. The renewal, reissuance, or transfer of a grazing permit may be excluded from environmental assessment if it continues current management, meets objectives, or aligns with policy. The Secretary concerned has the discretion to prioritize and complete environmental analyses for grazing allotments based on significance and available funding. Certain NEPA exemptions apply to activities like livestock crossing authorizations and grazing preference transfers. Sec. 405 addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases."
