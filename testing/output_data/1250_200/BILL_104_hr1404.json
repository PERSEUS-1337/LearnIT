The Act defines terms such as \"article of fur,\" \"interstate or foreign commerce,\" \"import,\" and \"person\" for the purpose of regulating the fur trade. The term \"steel jaw leghold trap\" is defined as a device designed to capture an animal by snapping closed upon the animal's limb. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and government entities subject to US jurisdiction. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES.\n\nNo fur article can be imported, exported, or shipped if derived from an animal trapped in a steel jaw leghold trap.
