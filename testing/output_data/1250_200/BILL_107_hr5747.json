    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act\". It includes findings related to food allergen labeling. Congress finds that approximately 2 percent of adults and 5 percent of infants and young children in the United States suffer from food allergies, leading to emergency room treatment and deaths. Eight major foods account for 90 percent of food allergies, with no cure currently available. A significant number of sampled foods have failed to list allergens like peanuts or eggs on their labels, highlighting the need for improved food allergen labeling. The number of recalls due to unlabeled allergens increased to 121 in 2000 from 35 a decade earlier. A study found that parents of children with food allergies struggle to identify allergens on food labels. Ingredients must be listed by their common or usual name, but some consumers may not recognize allergens. Celiac disease causes damage to various organs. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated condition that damages the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and other organs. Treatment involves avoiding gluten-containing foods. A study estimated that 0.5 to 1 percent of the US population has celiac disease. SEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC SUBSTANCES. Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include requirements for labeling major food allergens in non-raw agricultural commodities. The allergen must be clearly identified in the list of ingredients using specific formats. The labeling requirements for major food allergens in non-raw agricultural commodities include specific formats for ingredient lists and exceptions for certain cases. The information may appear in labeling instead of on the label if deemed sufficient by the Secretary to protect public health. Spices, flavorings, colorings, or incidental additives containing major food allergens are also subject to these labeling requirements. The law requires that any spice, flavoring, coloring, or additive containing a major food allergen must be labeled accordingly. The Secretary has the authority to modify or eliminate labeling requirements if necessary for public health. Additionally, non-major food allergens in spices or additives must be disclosed as specified by the Secretary. This does not affect the Secretary's authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require labeling of other food allergens. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to define major food allergens as milk, egg, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. The effective date for labeling major food allergens is January 1, 2006. Food products containing major food allergens must be labeled in compliance with the requirements of the 2006 amendment. SEC. 4. REPORT ON FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report by June 30, 2004, analyzing unintentional contamination of major food allergens in food manufacturing. The report should estimate the prevalence of these practices in the industry and recommend good manufacturing practices. The report analyzes the prevalence of unintentional contamination of major food allergens in the food industry, recommends good manufacturing practices to reduce cross-contact, describes advisory labeling used by food producers, determines consumer preferences for risk communication on food labels, and identifies appropriate circumstances for advisory labeling. SEC. 5. INSPECTIONS RELATING TO FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services prioritizes increasing inspections of food facilities to ensure compliance with practices to reduce cross-contact of allergens and proper labeling. Biennial reports are submitted to Congress detailing inspection findings, violations, and voluntary recalls. The biennial reports submitted to Congress detail compliance status, violations, voluntary recalls, advisory language use, and efforts to address cross-contact issues in food facilities. SEC. 6. LABELING OF GLUTENS AND CELIAC DISEASE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review on glutens associated with celiac disease, prevention and treatment methods, and gluten detection in foods. The report must be submitted to specific committees within 2 years. The Institute of Medicine will collaborate with experts in celiac disease for the review and report. The Secretary will issue rules for the use of \"gluten-free\" labeling on foods within 4-6 years of the Act's enactment. A report assessing additional gluten labeling requirements will be submitted to specific committees within 2 years of the review on celiac disease conducted by the Institute of Medicine. The report will assess if more gluten labeling requirements are needed to better inform individuals with celiac disease and identify the types of labeling needed. SEC. 7. DATA ON FOOD-RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must conduct a study within one year to determine if current systems accurately capture data on food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. This includes identifying new systems or enhancements for data collection and analysis. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will improve data collection and publish national data on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. A report to Congress is due within 30 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will report to Congress on the progress of preventing allergic responses to foods within 30 months of the Act's enactment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. SEC. 8. FOOD ALLERGIES RESEARCH. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a panel of experts to review and coordinate research on food allergies. A plan will be submitted to Congress within 1 year. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revise the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in various food establishments. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided for the treatment and prevention of allergic responses to foods."
