Investors and speculators took advantage of the rising market values, leading to a peak in the Nikkei stock market average in 1989 followed by a sharp decline. Banks considered loans with real estate collateral secure, but the bubbles eventually burst, resulting in significant losses. The bursting of Japan's economic bubble in the late 1980s led to a financial and banking crisis, causing a drastic reduction in capital reserves for banks. Commercial land values in major metropolitan areas fell by 80%, while residential and industrial land values dropped by nearly 20%. This crisis resulted in non-performing loans of $280 billion reported by Japan's banks in 1995, which was later found to be vastly understated. In 1995, Japan's banks reported $280 billion in non-performing loans, which was later found to be understated. Unlike the US, Japanese financial institutions did not bundle loans as collateralized debt obligations or rely heavily on derivatives. Mortgage defaults in Japan were mainly on commercial property, not private residences. Commercial lending in Japan was often relational, based on connections rather than purely market-based. Japanese banks sometimes extended small additional loans to borrowers in default to avoid reporting the loan as non-performing, leading to adverse effects on the economy. The bursting of Japan's real estate and stock bubbles in the late 1980s led to a significant economic downturn in the 1990s. Economic growth rates dropped sharply, with a temporary recovery in 1996 followed by a recession in 1998 and 1999. The government's initial strategy to address the banking crisis was to extend small additional loans to borrowers in default to prevent reporting the loans as non-performing. This prolonged the economic downturn, resulting in an extended L-shaped recession for Japan. The government's initial strategy during the banking crisis was forbearance, protecting depositors and providing emergency liquidity. Japan's banking system was compared to a convoy of ships, with the government overseeing and intervening extensively to prevent major banks from sinking. The \"community banking mentality\" led banks to continue lending to defaulting firms, contributing to the economic downturn. The government's initial strategy during the banking crisis was forbearance, protecting depositors and providing emergency liquidity. Japan's banking system was compared to a convoy of ships, with the government overseeing and intervening extensively to prevent major banks from sinking. The \"community banking mentality\" led banks to continue lending to defaulting firms, contributing to the economic downturn. In 1992, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) was created to help banks dispose of non-performing loans, similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States. The CCPC purchased \u00a51.3 trillion in non-performing loans from the top 21 banks in 1993, accounting for 54% of all loans written off that year. The selling bank would extend credit to the CCPC for the purchase cost of the non-performing loan, allowing the bank to count the difference as a capital loss for tax purposes. The government's strategy during the banking crisis was to protect depositors and provide emergency liquidity. The Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) was created to help banks dispose of non-performing loans. The CCPC repaid the credit extended by the selling bank when the collateral was sold, recovering half of the underlying value of the loans. Despite billions in write-offs, new non-performing loans continued to appear rapidly, leading to a peak of $330 billion in outstanding loans in March 2002. The Japanese government implemented stimulus packages and fiscal policies in response to the banking crisis, with new non-performing loans continuing to increase rapidly. By 1995, the burst speculative bubble had caused failures in financial institutions, leading to a worsening economic situation. Despite efforts to inject capital into ailing housing lenders, the government faced political backlash and hesitated to implement stronger policies to combat the recession. The burst speculative bubble in Japan caused failures in financial institutions, leading to a systemic crisis in the banking sector by 1997. The government responded with a $250 billion bailout, purchasing bankrupt banks like Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. These banks had no consumer deposit system but borrowed funds to lend to businesses. The government eventually sold these banks to private investors. The Japanese government responded to the banking crisis by injecting billions of dollars to support banks, implementing new laws and regulations, and overseeing a reorganization of the banking sector. By 2005, the banks reported 3.5% of their total lending as non-performing. The government also pursued monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal stimulus packages to combat the crisis. The Japanese government implemented nine stimulus packages during the 1990s, including a negative stimulus in April 1997 when the consumption tax was raised. The total amounts for the packages may be misleading due to items already included in previous budgets. The government indicated new spending as \"real water\" and the figures for GDP percentages should be considered upper bounds. In 1993, 1995, and 1998, two stimulus packages were announced per year. The Japanese government implemented multiple stimulus packages in the 1990s, with some years having two packages announced. The Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan played a key role in bank rescue operations, providing various forms of assistance to prevent financial institutions from failing. The DICJ's annual reports detail the disposition of funds from Japan's financial assistance packages. The DICJ provided financial assistance totaling $399 billion as of March 2007, including grants, asset purchases, and capital injections. The grants were funded by DICJ bonds and deposit insurance premiums. Asset purchases of $83 billion included assets from failed institutions, with $79 billion recovered. Capital injections of $106 billion were made into 25 banks. $31.3 billion of assets were still held by the DICJ in the form of preferred stock. The DICJ injected capital into 25 banks, holding $31.3 billion in assets as of March 2007. The \"Other\" category included loans to banks under special management, debt assumption, and compensation for losses. The Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC) purchased assets worth $34.5 billion for $3.0 billion, selling them for $5.2 billion, resulting in a 172% gain. The RCC purchased troubled assets at a discount and sold them at a profit. Japan's government debt increased as the economy stagnated. Public debt typically doubles in the three years following a financial crisis. Japan's central government debt as a percent of GDP rose significantly. The Ricardian equivalence theorem suggests that government deficits lead to increased saving by individuals. The Ricardian equivalence theorem suggests that government deficits lead to increased saving by individuals, who anticipate future tax increases to repay the debt. Despite high saving rates in Japan, fiscal stimulus packages had expected multiplier effects, with tax cuts targeted at the most liquidity constrained having the largest impact. Fiscal stimulus in the 1990s was deemed necessary due to limitations on monetary stimulus, such as zero interest rates. The fiscal stimulus in Japan during the 1990s was necessary due to limitations on monetary stimulus. However, the impact of fiscal deficits on restoring growth was muted as efforts to clean up non-performing loans and deregulate the economy were lacking. The government aimed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% and the deficit to GDP ratio to 3% by 2003, but these targets were not met. Tightening fiscal policy too soon may have prolonged the recession. The Japanese government aimed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% and the deficit to GDP ratio to 3% by 2003, but by then, the debt-to-GDP ratio had risen to 141% and the deficit to GDP ratio had increased to 5.4%. Despite periods of economic growth, the national debt continued to grow, requiring payments for interest, redemptions, and administrative costs. The bottom of Figure 2 compares interest payments as a percentage of government expenditures between the United States and Japan. Japan's interest share decreased from 17% in the 1990s to 11.5% in 2007 due to lower interest rates. The US also saw a decline from 15% to 8.3% in 2008. The concern is whether this trend can continue with the large fiscal deficits in 2009, leading to questions about investors holding government bonds with higher interest rates and potential risks of inflation or default. Lessons from Japan's experience include underestimating banking issues. Authorities initially underestimated the seriousness of the banking problem in Japan, hoping economic growth and low central bank interest rates would resolve it. The extent of non-performing loans and support for \"zombie\" firms delayed the problem's resolution. Transparency and updated reporting on non-performing loans were crucial. Government injections of capital were often needed to rescue struggling financial firms. Lack of constraints and political leadership hindered decisive action. New institutions were created for emergency financial assistance, later transferred to the Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Japanese government took decisive action by creating new institutions for emergency financial assistance, later transferring these activities to the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan (DICJ). The DICJ had the authority to assist troubled financial institutions and injected capital through various means, such as buying troubled assets at a discount and providing capital injections in the form of stock subscriptions, grants, and loans. Despite the $495 billion financial support packages between 1998 and 2003, Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans. Between 1998 and 2003, Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans. The government's holdings of corporate shares generated income for the DICJ. Recovery efforts focused on large banks and fewer smaller financial institutions. Japan's early financial rescue package had stringent conditions that banks ignored, leading to a decline in lending and worsening economic conditions. The bursting of the real estate bubble in Japan caused more difficulty for banks than the stock market bubble. The bursting of the real estate bubble in Japan caused more difficulty for banks than the stock market bubble, affecting collateral values on bank lending. Japan's slow response to monetary and fiscal policies, as well as banking sector issues, led to challenges. Fiscal policy tightened too soon after the economy began to recover."
