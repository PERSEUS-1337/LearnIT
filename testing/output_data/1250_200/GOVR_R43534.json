    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent revelations have led to proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and preside over cases with dispositive judgments. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and preside over cases with dispositive judgments. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. The FISC is authorized to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations, and the FISA Court of Review can review the denial of any application by the FISC. Judges of both courts serve seven-year terms and are not eligible for a second term. The U.S. Supreme Court designates federal judges to serve on the FISC and FISA Court of Review for seven-year terms. Critics argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges, leading to proposed bills in Congress to change the selection process. One proposal suggests giving the chief judges of circuit courts the authority to recommend judges, while another would allow the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice. The bill proposes changes to the selection process of FISA judges, including giving the President or congressional leadership the authority to designate judges. The constitutionality of shifting this authority away from the Chief Justice is a key issue raised by these proposals. The report reviews the constitutional method for appointing federal judges and explores how a reviewing court might assess the constitutionality of these changes. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment of government officials, including judges. The Supreme Court has ruled that expanding duties of an office may not require a second appointment if the new duties are related to the original post. For example, military officers may not need a second appointment if their expanded duties are relevant to their original appointment. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Appointments Clause allows for the designation of existing federal judges to serve in related Article III capacities without a second appointment. Congress has long used designations for Article III courts and the Chief Justice can temporarily assign federal judges to other federal courts. The Chief Justice has authority to designate federal judges to serve on specialized tribunals, such as the now-defunct Commerce Court. This process, upheld by the Supreme Court, has been a model for future specialized courts like the FISA courts. Congress has also given lower federal court judges designation authority. The power of Congress to designate district court judges to temporarily discharge duties in another district has been upheld as a matter of statutory construction. Courts have dismissed constitutional challenges to the Chief Justice's designation authority for district court judges, stating that it does not violate the Appointments Clause. The constitutionality of the designation process for FISA judges has also been upheld by courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause. They cited precedent for the temporary assignment of judges by the Chief Justice. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges. The central issue is whether designation by certain individuals within the branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act would maintain designation authority within the judicial branch. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. It suggests increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating judges to the FISA courts, with input from chief judges of the circuit courts and associate justices of the Supreme Court. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes involving the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice in the selection process for the FISC judges. While the Supreme Court would have a role in the designation process, the Chief Justice would still have the final authority. The McDowell case suggests that Congress has the power to authorize others within the judicial branch to designate judges, indicating that such an arrangement could be constitutional. The McDowell case suggests that Congress may not have the authority to give chief judges broad power to designate judges for the FISA courts. One proposal is to shift this authority to the President through the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761), which would require Senate approval for judge appointments. This could be seen as a second constitutional appointment, following the Appointments Clause. A separate constitutional appointment for FISA judges could potentially raise questions about their status as Article III courts due to the fixed seven-year terms. However, precedent suggests that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary, allowing for judges to maintain their Article III status even when appointed to serve on special courts for a limited time. On the other hand, vesting the President with the sole authority to select federal judges for the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns. The President's authority to select federal judges for the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns, but precedent shows that judges can maintain their Article III status even when appointed for limited terms. The President's power to remove a judge from the FISA courts does not affect their tenure as an Article III judge on their original court. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as their removal power could influence judges' impartiality. Proposals like the FISA Court Accountability Act suggest allowing both the Chief Justice and congressional leadership to make designations, which could conflict with the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. Congress can select individuals for entities aiding in legislative functions but cannot directly appoint appointees. Congress can select individuals for entities aiding in legislative functions, but they do not have the authority to directly appoint appointees exercising significant authority under the laws of the United States. Congressional designations may raise legal concerns under the principles of I.N.S. v. Chadha, which require bicameralism and presentment. Designations made to the judiciary without proper approval could implicate the principles established in Chadha."
