    "content": "During the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder highlighted the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses, calling it an epidemic. As a response, Congress added a provision to P.L. 105-244, making students convicted of drug-related crimes ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Students convicted of drug-related crimes are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple convictions. To regain eligibility, students must complete a drug rehabilitation program or have the conviction removed from their record. The ineligibility period starts from the date of conviction, ranging from one to indefinite years based on the offense. Students convicted of drug-related crimes are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The ineligibility period ranges from one to indefinite years based on the offense. To regain eligibility, students must complete a drug rehabilitation program meeting specific requirements outlined in the program regulations. Students convicted of drug-related crimes can regain eligibility for federal student assistance by participating in a rehabilitation program that includes at least two unannounced drug tests. Completion of the program allows the student to self-certify their completion. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision since its adoption. Since its adoption, over 180,000 students have been denied federal financial aid or faced delays due to drug-related convictions. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision to only disqualify students for drug convictions while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV aid. California and Texas have seen a high number of students affected by this provision. The period of ineligibility for federal financial aid due to drug convictions depends on the type of conviction, recency, and prior convictions. Legislative proposals aim to modify this provision, addressing implementation, penalties, and who should be penalized. Concerns about drug-related crimes on college campuses led to the provision's addition in 1998. Policymakers are discussing potential changes during the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA. During reauthorization, the focus on drug-related crimes on college campuses was a key concern for policymakers. Critics argue that singling out drugs for financial aid eligibility penalties is unfair compared to other crimes like rape or robbery. Supporters justify this focus by pointing out the higher likelihood of drug-related crimes on campuses. The implications of limiting financial aid eligibility for drug convictions may lead to discussions about other illegal behaviors like alcohol abuse. The existing provision for financial aid eligibility does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony drug-related convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility for all convictions. Congress may debate the distinction between felony and misdemeanor drug convictions in relation to student aid suspension."
