The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" highlights the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and nursing assistants due to patient lifting injuries. This leads to chronic back pain and a significant number of healthcare workers leaving the profession. Patient safety is also compromised as a result. The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" emphasizes the negative impact of manual patient handling on the health of employees and patient safety. Implementing assistive patient handling technology has shown to reduce injuries among healthcare workers and improve patient outcomes. Facilities have implemented safe patient handling technology, reducing lost work days and staff turnover. Studies show it also lowers workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several States have adopted safe patient handling standards, proving their success. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is crucial for their safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The legislation includes a Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard for facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must establish a safe patient handling standard within 1 year of the Act's enactment to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers. The standard will require the use of engineering controls and mechanical technology to minimize injuries from manual patient handling. The safe patient handling standard mandated by the Secretary of Labor aims to minimize injuries to healthcare workers by implementing mechanical technology and alternative controls. Health care employers must develop a program within 6 months that includes hazard identification and risk assessments related to patient care duties. Additionally, within 2 years, employers must purchase and manage technology and equipment to support safe patient handling. The safe patient handling standard requires health care employers to purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment and technology within 2 years. Employers must also involve health care workers in developing and implementing the program, and establish a data tracking and review system. The health care employers must analyze data on the implementation of safe patient handling programs, including situations where technology or trained lift teams were not used. Employers should make their findings available to workers and authorities. Additionally, employers must consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility designs or remodels, and provide education and training on safe patient handling practices. Health care employers are required to train workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies annually. Training should cover identifying and controlling musculoskeletal hazards and be interactive. Employers must also post a notice explaining these standards. The annual evaluation of the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program must include procedures, technology selection, injury assessment, and input from healthcare workers and their representatives. Health care employers must document input from healthcare workers and their representatives in the evaluation. Workers have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safety regulations. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in healthcare facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments specify the inclusion of these standards in various subsections and outline the effective date of implementation. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. States can still enforce laws that provide equal or greater protections for employees. Health care workers' rights are not affected by this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, a direct-care registered nurse is defined as an individual licensed to provide bedside care or outpatient services. An employee includes health care workers and independent contractors. Employment covers services provided under a contract. Handling involves physical actions like lifting or moving patients. A health care employer is defined as an entity employing health care workers. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"health care employer,\" \"health care worker,\" and \"lift team\" in relation to patient handling and musculoskeletal injury risks. These terms encompass various healthcare facilities and individuals involved in patient care."
