    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate during the financial crisis, leading to government intervention to support the mortgage markets. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock and provided mortgage market support by buying nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. Treasury's purchase includes contracts requiring a 10% cash dividend. Proposed legislation may reduce the enterprises' size and increase their costs, potentially impacting mortgage prices and interest rates. Proposed legislation aims to reduce the enterprises' size, increase costs, and enhance regulatory oversight. This includes new limitations on mortgage purchases, increased capital requirements, and a deadline for returning to stockholder control or dissolution. Additionally, there are proposals to replace the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced financial difficulties due to mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. They entered voluntary conservatorship in 2008, with the FHFA taking control. The Treasury provided financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners rely on them for mortgage money as they purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into MBS for investors. The enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into MBS for investors. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system, including a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. The Obama Administration's proposals for housing finance reform are not discussed further in this report. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses various concerns, with H.R. 31 focusing on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's accountability and transparency. This bill would require quarterly reports on specific areas such as liabilities, executive compensation, and foreclosure mitigation efforts. The bill introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 31, focuses on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's accountability and transparency. It requires quarterly reports on various areas including executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, mortgage fraud prevention, and underwriting standards. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports and inform Congress of his findings, with all information to be posted on the FHFA website. The bill H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, would require quarterly reports on FHFA's loss mitigation policies and impact of principal reduction. It emphasizes the importance of oversight in these areas and allows FOIA requests for the enterprises. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, aims to subject the enterprises to FOIA requests by treating them as federal agencies. H.R. 1221, Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, seeks to limit executive pay at the enterprises and align it with federal government schedules. The bill also includes provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance under TARP. The bill aims to limit executive pay at enterprises and align it with federal government schedules. It would require enterprises to charge a guarantee fee reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. FHFA's authority to reject salaries would be removed, and it could phase in higher fees over two years. The Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 1222 and forwarded it to the full committee. FHFA has the authority to implement these provisions as conservator or receiver. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, aims to treat mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises similarly to others. Dodd-Frank requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS. QRMs would be exempt under Dodd-Frank. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and FHFA are required to issue joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS under Dodd-Frank. QRMs would be exempt from this requirement. H.R. 1223 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Federal Reserve's general counsel stated that the enterprises' guarantees do not satisfy the risk retention requirements, but proposed rules would allow it under conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224 aims to reduce the enterprises' portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. The enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are required to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. H.R. 1224 and companion bills aim to achieve this reduction, with different timelines proposed. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1224 for further review. FHFA has the authority to order faster reductions in portfolios to manage risk. H.R. 1224 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Financial Services for further review. FHFA, as regulator, could order enterprises to reduce their portfolios more rapidly. H.R. 1225 would require enterprises to seek permission from the Treasury Secretary to issue new debt, with a seven-day waiting period after approval. The Secretary previously had this authority, but it fell into disuse. Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Emil Henry noted a more formal process for debt sales until the mid-1990s. H.R. 1226, the GSE Mission Improvement Act, aims to repeal affordable housing goals and duties for underserved markets. FHFA would need to report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans in rural areas within six months. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1226 and H.R. 1227, which aim to increase mortgage credit in underserved areas and limit new product approvals for enterprises in conservatorship. FHFA would need to report on the impact of these bills within six months. H.R. 2425, Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would restrict GSEs from dealing with mortgages registered with MERS. Legal challenges surround MERS' authority in foreclosures. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, aims to regulate legal expenses for employees. FHFA can repudiate contracts under HERA. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to prevent a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury by the enterprises. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, would terminate housing funds established by HERA. H.R. 2440, Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, directs FHFA to identify non-mission critical activities. $80 million was appropriated in the FY2010 budget for the Capital Magnet Fund. H.R. 2440, Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including patents and mortgage data. FHFA would submit a plan to Congress to sell these assets and require the release of loan and appraisal data without disclosing personal information. H.R. 2462, Cap the GSE Bailout Act of 2011, would set the maximum support amount for each enterprise in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. Treasury has contracted to purchase preferred stock to keep the enterprises solvent, with the limit raised to $200 billion each. In late 2009, the PSPA were amended to provide unlimited support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010-2012, with a $200 billion limit outside of those years. Various bills in Congress aim to reform or replace the enterprises, with some proposing to terminate their conservatorships within 24 months. The GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would either go into receivership or continue under revised charters with changes such as reducing portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. Housing goals would no longer apply, and certain provisions from other bills are not included in this one. The GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would either be returned to stockholder control or dissolved under receivership. Their charters would be repealed for new business after three years, followed by a 10-year wind-down period to dissolve the enterprises. FHFA would have strengthened authority to set and enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions, and the enterprises would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages greater than the area median home price. The minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased by the enterprises would be 5% during the first 12 months after leaving conservatorship.

The minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased by the enterprises would be 5% during the 12 months after leaving conservatorship, 7.5% during the second 12 months, and 10% afterward. The enterprises would be required to pay all state and local taxes, register all stocks and public offerings with the SEC, and be charged for the value of the benefits provided by the government. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 propose changes such as increasing guarantee fees, reducing enterprise portfolios to $250 billion each over five years, and repealing affordable housing goals. They also aim to end the enterprises' conservatorship in 24 months, phase out their charters for new business after three years, lower the conforming loan limit to $417,000, increase borrower downpayment requirements, and require the enterprises to pay all state and local taxes. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, would authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize single-family and multifamily mortgages. The associations would guarantee timely payment to investors, with a backup guarantee from the federal government. They would specialize in specific markets like community banks and multifamily mortgages, with a maximum mortgage size based on national or area median prices. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 would establish housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages, with a nationwide mortgage limit of $256,000. The associations would specialize in specific markets and have backup guarantees from the federal government. The highest area limits would be $897,300 in Honolulu and $886,500 in San Jose. FHFA would regulate the associations and create a plan to wind down the enterprises as they were chartered. During the transition, the enterprises would not have affordable housing goals and would be required to pay state and local taxes. H.R. 2413, Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011, proposes creating a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific standards. The facility would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusting them to maintain market share below 50%. Fees would cover mortgage payments during normal times and compensate Treasury for federal guarantees. Eligible mortgages would be 30 years or less, up to 80% of the house price (or 90% with private mortgage insurance). Maximum size based on a formula with a $729,750 cap in high-cost areas. The proposed federal corporation would oversee a secondary market facility for residential mortgages, charging guarantee and reinsurance fees to cover mortgage payments and compensate Treasury for federal guarantees. Eligible mortgages would be up to 80% of the house price (or 90% with private mortgage insurance), with a maximum size based on a formula with a $729,750 cap in high-cost areas."
