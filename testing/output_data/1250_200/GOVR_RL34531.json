    "content": "The United States is involved in Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with foreign countries to establish the framework for U.S. military personnel operating abroad. These agreements determine rights, privileges, and criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel, with some agreements allowing shared jurisdiction. SOFAs do not address mutual defense or security agreements, specific exercises, or wartime laws. They also do not affect parties' right of self-defense under the law of war. The United States is involved in Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with foreign countries to establish the framework for U.S. military personnel operating abroad. SOFAs do not affect parties' right of self-defense under the law of war. A SOFA is specific to an individual country and is in the form of an executive agreement. The terms of a SOFA may be contained in other agreements with a partner country. The NATO SOFA was ratified by the Senate on March 19, 1970, with reservations including conditions on criminal jurisdiction and procedural safeguards for U.S. servicemembers tried in a receiving state. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement among member countries of NATO, with 26 countries having ratified or acceded to it. Another 24 countries are subject to the NATO SOFA through the NATO Partnership for Peace program, which aims to increase stability and build security relationships. The agreement includes provisions for reviewing receiving state laws, requesting jurisdiction waivers, and appointing a U.S. representative to protect servicemembers' constitutional rights during trials. The NATO SOFA and NATO PfP aim to increase stability and security relationships between countries. The United States has agreements with approximately 58 countries through these agreements. Department of Defense Directive 5525.1 outlines policies to protect U.S. personnel subject to foreign trials and imprisonment. Reservations to the NATO SOFA apply to NATO member countries and will be applied to future SOFAs. The policy states that comparable reservations shall be applied to future SOFAs in countries where applicable. A SOFA may cover criminal and civil jurisdiction, wearing of uniforms, taxes, carrying of weapons, radio frequencies, license requirements, and customs regulations. SOFAs can vary in length, from one page to over 200 pages. Examples include agreements between the United States and Bangladesh for a joint exercise in 1998, and with Botswana for forces temporarily present for exercises, training, or humanitarian assistance. The agreement with Botswana allows for U.S. personnel to be present for exercises, training, or humanitarian assistance. It addresses legal protection from prosecution and establishes jurisdiction for criminal and civil laws. Shared jurisdiction is common, where both the U.S. and the signatory country have authority. The United States and signatory countries may have exclusive or shared jurisdiction over U.S. personnel, even when they are off military installations. Agreements like the one with Mongolia grant the U.S. the right to exercise criminal jurisdiction over its personnel in the host country. The agreement with Mongolia grants the United States military authorities the right to exercise criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction over U.S. personnel in Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia can request the U.S. to waive jurisdiction in cases of non-official criminal behavior, with no requirement for the U.S. to do so. The NATO SOFA allows for shared jurisdiction among member countries, with the option to request waiver of primary jurisdiction. The NATO SOFA allows for shared jurisdiction among member countries, with the option to request waiver of primary jurisdiction. Each country is provided exclusive jurisdiction in specific circumstances, with concurrent jurisdiction present when offenses violate the laws of both countries. The United States has entered SOFAs with basic rules for determining jurisdiction, some containing a single sentence stating U.S. personnel are to be afforded a status equivalent to that of the U.S. Embassy staff. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations establishes classes of personnel with varying legal protections. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 establishes legal protections for administrative and technical staff of the U.S. Embassy, including immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. SOFAs do not authorize military operations but do not affect the right of self-defense for U.S. personnel. Language within the SOFA defines the agreement's scope, such as in the case of the SOFA with Belize. The SOFA with Belize provides legal protections for U.S. personnel during military exercises and training, counter-drug activities, and security assistance programs. It addresses administrative and operational matters such as jurisdiction, wearing of uniforms, taxes, carrying weapons, radio frequencies, driving licenses, and customs regulations. Most SOFAs are bilateral agreements tailored to specific purposes. A SOFA is a bilateral agreement that provides legal framework for U.S. personnel in foreign countries, tailored to their specific needs. The United States has agreements with foreign nations related to security commitments, which can include collective defense agreements, consultation requirements, legal right to military intervention, and other non-binding arrangements. SOFAs are part of comprehensive security agreements along with basing, access, and pre-positioning agreements. A SOFA is a bilateral agreement that provides a legal framework for U.S. personnel in foreign countries. It is often part of comprehensive security arrangements along with other military agreements. The United States has entered into SOFAs with countries like Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. initiated Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and subsequently signed security agreements with the new Afghan government in 2002. The United States and Afghanistan signed security agreements in 2002, allowing for economic grants and defense assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The act aims to promote foreign policy, security, and economic development globally. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the President to provide military assistance to friendly countries and international organizations to strengthen US security and promote world peace. This includes furnishing defense articles, services, and noncombatant personnel. The act limits military assistance to noncombatant duties for US Armed Forces and Department of Defense personnel. An agreement exists regarding the status of military and civilian personnel of the US Department of Defense. An agreement exists regarding the status of military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense in Afghanistan, granting them immunity from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities and civil jurisdiction, with the U.S. government authorized to exercise criminal jurisdiction over them. The agreement with Afghanistan grants immunity to Department of Defense personnel from Afghan prosecution and civil jurisdiction, allowing the U.S. government to exercise criminal jurisdiction over them. It does not provide immunity for contract personnel and does not explicitly authorize military operations in Afghanistan, but acknowledges ongoing operations. Congress authorized the use of military force in Afghanistan in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks, with subsequent UN Security Council resolutions supporting the deployment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The United States and Afghanistan entered into an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement in 2004, providing logistic support to foreign militaries. The agreement acknowledges the legitimacy of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in addressing security threats in Afghanistan. An Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) allows the US to provide logistic support, supplies, and services to foreign militaries on a reimbursement basis. The Secretary of Defense can enter into an ACSA with NATO countries, UN organizations, or other international bodies. If the country is not a NATO member, notification must be given to relevant congressional committees. President Karzai and President Bush discussed a future agreement between the US and Afghanistan in 2005. President Hamid Karzai and President Bush issued a \"joint declaration\" in 2005 outlining a prospective agreement for U.S. military troops to assist Afghan security forces until Afghanistan can sustain itself. President Karzai later called for formal SOFAs with foreign forces in Afghanistan, but it is unclear if negotiations have begun. The Obama Administration committed to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan, planning to transfer security responsibility to the Afghan government by 2014. Representative Lynn Woolsey introduced the United States-Afghanistan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Act of 2011, requiring a bilateral agreement stating the temporary presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and their withdrawal within one year. The United States and Germany entered into agreements related to mutual defense assistance in 1951, prior to Germany joining NATO in 1955. The NATO SOFA of 1953 was implemented between the two countries, with additional supplemental agreements covering day-to-day operations of U.S. forces in Germany. Similarly, the United States and Japan concluded a security treaty and administrative agreement in 1952. In 1952, the United States and Japan signed a security treaty and administrative agreement. The agreement included provisions on jurisdiction over offenses committed by U.S. forces in Japan. In 1957, a U.S. Army member was indicted for the death of a Japanese civilian, with the U.S. claiming it was in the line of duty. After negotiations, the U.S. agreed to hand over the member to Japanese authorities. The member sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to avoid trial in Japanese Courts. The writ was denied, but an injunction against delivery to Japanese authorities was granted. The U.S. appealed to the Supreme Court in Wilson v. Girard, where it was determined that Japan ceded jurisdiction to the U.S. to try American military personnel for offenses committed within its borders. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, concluded in 1960 and amended in 1990, grants the United States the use of facilities in Japan for security purposes. The Court found no constitutional or legislative barriers to the jurisdictional provisions outlined in the treaty, leaving the decision on its wisdom to the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, signed in 1960, allows the U.S. to use facilities in Japan for security reasons. A separate agreement, known as the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), was also established in 1960 to govern the use of facilities and the status of U.S. forces in Japan. The agreement has been amended multiple times since its inception. Additionally, in 1954, the U.S. and South Korea entered into a mutual defense treaty granting the U.S. the right to station forces in South Korea. Article IV of the treaty grants the United States the right to station land, air, and sea forces in South Korea. In 1966, a SOFA was signed between the two countries, later amended in 2001. A legal case in 1968 questioned the legitimacy of U.S. authorities releasing a servicemember to Korea for trial, arguing that the agreement required Senate approval. The court found that the SOFA reduced Korea's jurisdiction and the U.S. did not waive jurisdiction over offenses committed on its territory. The court ruled that Senate approval for the SOFA with South Korea was unnecessary as the U.S. did not waive jurisdiction over offenses committed on its territory. The Constitution and UCMJ provide the methods for trying servicemen abroad, with primary jurisdiction lying with the nation where the crime was committed. The court cited the principle that the nation where the crime occurred holds primary jurisdiction. The United States and the Republic of the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement in 1947, extended and amended in 1953. A mutual defense treaty was signed in 1951, with a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) established in 1993 and subsequently extended multiple times. The United States and the Republic of the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement in 1947, extended and amended in 1953. A mutual defense treaty was signed in 1951, with a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) established in 1993 and subsequently extended multiple times. The countries also entered into agreements regarding the treatment of U.S. Armed Forces and Republic of Philippines personnel visiting each other's countries. The counterpart agreement contains provisions addressing criminal jurisdiction over Philippine personnel while in the United States. The agreement was concluded as an executive agreement and not ratified by the U.S. Senate. The United States and the Republic of the Philippines have a military assistance agreement dating back to 1947, with a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951. The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was established in 1993 and extended multiple times. The counterpart agreement addresses criminal jurisdiction over Philippine personnel in the U.S., with the U.S. retaining the ability to exercise jurisdiction if needed. In contrast to SOFAs with other countries, the U.S. does not fully waive jurisdiction over offenses committed within its territory. The United States and Iraq signed a Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship to replace the UN mandate for security in Iraq. The parties aimed to reach agreements in political, cultural, economic, and security spheres by July 31, 2008, including supporting Iraqi Security Forces and fighting terrorism. The United States and Iraq signed a Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship to support Iraqi Security Forces, fight terrorism, and provide security assurances to Iraq. This led to congressional interest and hearings in the 110th Congress regarding a proposed security agreement. In late 2007, Congress passed a provision limiting funds for entering into an agreement subjecting U.S. Armed Forces to Iraqi criminal jurisdiction. In October 2008, the U.S. and Iraq signed the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Agreement on the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces. Congress required a report on the agreement, including security assurances, basing rights, and the status of U.S. forces in Iraq. Several legislative proposals aimed to make the agreement subject to Senate approval or statutory enactment. The Strategic Framework Agreement and Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq differ from the long-term security arrangement originally planned. The agreements require the withdrawal of U.S. forces by December 31, 2011. The Strategic Framework Agreement covers various fields of cooperation, including diplomatic, security, economic, cultural, and law enforcement matters. It also emphasizes close cooperation in defense and security arrangements. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq outlines defense and security arrangements, stating that U.S. forces are in Iraq at the request of the sovereign government and must withdraw by December 31, 2011. It prohibits the use of Iraqi territory for attacks on other countries and prohibits the establishment of permanent military bases. The Agreement contains provisions on civil and criminal jurisdiction over U.S. forces and rules for carrying weapons. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq grants civil and criminal jurisdiction over U.S. forces in Iraq. It includes rules on carrying weapons, wearing uniforms, entry and exit into Iraq, taxes, customs, and claims. The Agreement also addresses combat operations by U.S. forces, requiring approval and coordination with Iraqi authorities. Additionally, it allows for strategic deliberations in the event of threats against Iraq, with the U.S. taking appropriate measures as agreed upon. The Security and Strategic Framework Agreements between the United States and Iraq, entered into force in 2009, raised controversy over whether congressional authorization was needed for the U.S. to engage in military operations in Iraq. The United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2010, transitioning to Operation New Dawn with 50,000 troops focusing on advising Iraqi Security Forces. By December 2011, all U.S. forces had completed their withdrawal, handing over security responsibilities to the Iraqi government. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement among member countries, with 26 countries including the US having ratified or acceded to it. Non-NATO countries can also be subject to the NATO SOFA through the Partnership for Peace program. The US has SOFAs with other countries based on treaties ratified by the US Senate. The United States has concluded Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with Japan, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines based on treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate. The agreements with Japan and Korea cite specific treaty authorities, while the agreements with Australia and the Philippines cite general obligations under previously concluded treaties. The United States has military assistance agreements with Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras based on the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty). These agreements address the status of U.S. personnel in each country and were later expanded upon with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs). Additionally, Congress approved compacts changing the status of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau to Freely Associated States, which also require SOFAs to be concluded. The United States has entered into various agreements with countries, including SOFAs, to address the status of U.S. personnel in different locations. These agreements are often related to specific activities or exercises, and serve to limit the scope of the agreement to support joint military exercises or humanitarian initiatives. SOFAs are agreements entered by the United States with other countries to address the status of U.S. personnel during specific activities or exercises. These agreements are sole executive agreements and may include language expanding the agreement to cover other activities as agreed upon by the countries. For example, the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) led to SOFAs with African countries, limiting the agreements to U.S. personnel involved in ACRI activities or other agreed-upon activities. Some SOFAs are entered without a specified activity or exercise. The SOFA agreements remain valid even without the existence of the ACRI. Some SOFAs are entered without a specified activity, containing broad language of applicability for U.S. personnel present or temporarily present in a country. These agreements also outline the scope of activities, which can range from official duties to specific activities like humanitarian efforts, exercises, or training."
