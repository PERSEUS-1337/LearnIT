    "content": "The research paper proposes a unified architecture using Recurrent Neural Networks for multi-time-horizon solar forecasting, reducing prediction errors and uncertainties in grid operation. The method achieves lower errors compared to previous models, enabling real-time multi-horizon forecasts for practical applications in the smart grid. The modern power grid, with higher renewable penetration and active loads, faces challenges with uncertainty and fluctuations. Real-time observability, control, and accurate renewable generation forecasts are crucial for resiliency and sustainable operational costs. ISOs are struggling with short-term forecasting errors, leading to increased costs. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could result in significant savings for the grid. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could save $5 billion per year, addressing grid reliability and operational cost challenges. Accurate solar power generation forecasts are crucial for effective integration of solar energy resources at all timescales. Improving forecast accuracy is a cost-effective method for incorporating solar energy into the grid and advancing smart grid evolution. The paper discusses the evolution of the smart grid and the importance of improving solar forecast accuracy for efficient integration. It reviews current forecasting approaches, introduces a unified architecture with a novel algorithm, and presents results and future research avenues. Forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction are classified into five categories. Forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction can be classified into five categories: Regressive methods like AR, ARIMA, and ES models, AI techniques such as ANN and fuzzy logic systems, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), Sensing methods, and Hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems. NWP models are based on physical laws governing weather and are useful for forecasting solar radiation where ground data is lacking, but they have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. To improve site-specific forecasts, regional NWP models are downscaled. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful in areas without ground-based measurements, analyzing air mass evolution through satellite images. Satellite sensing has limitations in determining accurate radiance values under clear sky conditions. The limitations of satellite sensing for solar irradiance forecasting include the challenge of accurately determining radiance values under different sky conditions. Empirical or statistical algorithms used in satellite sensing rely on ground-based solar data, leading to a shift towards using statistical and AI techniques for short-term solar forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can model complex non-linear relationships between variables like humidity, temperature, pressure, and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). With multiple hidden layers, they form Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are effective in solving complex problems in various fields. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting, unlike feedforward neural network models. RNNs capture sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections, allowing for processing of arbitrary sequences and predicting irradiance for the next time step based on input from previous time steps. Recent advancements in parallelism, network architectures, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting. This paper proposes two approaches using RNNs: a single algorithm capable of forecasting solar irradiance for different time horizons, and a unified architecture for multi-time-horizon forecasting. The proposed method can provide real-time predictions with a forward inference time in milliseconds. The proposed method using RNNs enables real-time multi-time-horizon forecasting for industrial applications with high renewable energy penetration. The RNN architecture allows the network to utilize past information in sequential data, with input and target sequences denoted by real-valued vectors. The input dimensions include Mini-batch Size, Number of columns per time-step, and Number of. The RNN input consists of three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The network unfolds the input vector over time, with neurons in each layer receiving input from the previous layer. The net input to a neuron in the next layer is the weighted sum of the previous neuron's output. An activation function is then applied to produce the neuron's output. The proposed architecture for the RNN includes weight matrices, bias parameters, ReLU activation function, backpropagation through time algorithm, Mean Squared Loss function, gradient computation, stochastic gradient descent optimizer, and RMSE calculation. The RNN aims to learn complex relationships between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance. The algorithm developed in this paper utilizes exogenous variables to predict solar irradiance, including atmospheric conditions and various solar and infrared measurements. The prediction RMSE is lower compared to other approaches, and the algorithm was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites. Input features include various solar and infrared measurements, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The algorithm developed in this paper uses exogenous variables to predict solar irradiance, including atmospheric conditions and solar measurements. Global downwelling solar measurements best represent Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at SURFRAD sites. Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar show a positive correlation. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI, and Mean Squared Error is used to measure the difference between target and output during training. The algorithm uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the target-output difference in the neural network training process. Root Mean Squared Error is calculated for benchmarking. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm flowchart is divided into three main blocks: data import, merging with clear sky GHI values, and dataset splitting. Clear sky index parameter is created, missing values are replaced, outliers are eliminated, and a Recurrent Neural Network model is defined. The algorithm conducts analysis to identify and eliminate outliers, normalizes data, defines a Recurrent Neural Network model with specified architectural parameters, trains and tests the model with dataset for specific years from SURFRAD observation sites. If RMSE is unsatisfactory, hyperparameters are tuned and model is retrained until satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The algorithm utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network model to predict solar radiation at various time horizons for SURFRAD sites, outperforming other machine learning algorithms in terms of RMSE values. The proposed method uses a Recurrent Neural Network model to predict solar radiation at different time horizons for SURFRAD sites, achieving lower RMSE values compared to other methods. This multitime-horizon approach allows for predictions across all short-term forecasting horizons, making it relevant for industry applications and optimizing smart grid efficiencies. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture utilizes AI for high-fidelity solar forecasting across various time horizons, addressing the limitations of current approaches. With the increasing availability of solar data and advancements in AI technology, this architecture shows promise for real-time forecasting in smart grid optimization. The proposed algorithm can be a complete forecasting system for real-time solar predictions across different time scales. It outperforms traditional Machine Learning methods in forecast quality and has low inference time. While a deeper neural network may have more capacity, it leads to high variance and reduced generalization power. Improvements can be made through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. Future research could explore extending the architecture with LSTM cells for intra-hour forecasting."
