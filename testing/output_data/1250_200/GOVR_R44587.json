    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, it became independent from DOT through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974. The NTSB conducts unbiased investigations, recommends safety improvements, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as an appeals board for transportation regulatory actions. It lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices. The NTSB, independent from DOT, investigates transportation incidents but lacks authority to enforce recommendations. It consists of a five-member board and 420 staff, with regional offices in four locations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office, impacting Hawaii. The NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii and regional staff in 25 states. Safety Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacements are appointed. Investigative staff are organized by transportation mode, with a court of appeals function for airmen and mariners. The Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications works with modal offices. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains, pipeline accidents, and major marine casualties. The Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and transportation safety advocacy. The NTSB investigates major marine casualties on U.S. waters and U.S.-flag vessels, as well as other transportation safety issues. It relies on experts from manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" to assist with investigations. Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings and conclusions. The NTSB bases its conclusions strictly on analysis and recommendations by NTSB staff, with formal procedures for parties to petition for reconsideration. Safeguards, including public meetings and financial disclosures, are in place to prevent external influence on investigations. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality during investigations, balancing input from involved parties while preventing influence. International treaties guide the NTSB's involvement in foreign aviation accident investigations. The NTSB can provide expertise for foreign investigations upon request, even without a vested interest. Reimbursements for costs incurred in overseas investigations can come from outside entities. Legislation now allows these receipts to be used as offsetting collections. The NTSB has recovered costs through the Safe Skies for Africa program. Annual costs for international investigations have ranged from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million, with a portion covered by the program. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with a high rate of implementation. DOT agencies must respond to recommendations within 90 days. Over 14,300 recommendations have been issued since 1967, leading to safety improvements. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with agencies not required to adopt them. Implementation of recommendations may be delayed due to various factors. The NTSB does not consider cost in developing recommendations and highlights key ones on a \"Most Wanted\" list for safety improvements. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, focusing on accidents, rail transit safety oversight, collision avoidance technologies, occupant protection, operator distractions, flight control, positive train control, tank car design, substance impairment prevention, and operator fitness for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and congressional decision-making, leading to legislative and regulatory changes in transportation safety. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, leading to legislative and regulatory changes. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 draw on NTSB investigations and recommendations to address airline pilot training and mental health screening. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 directs the FAA to assess recommendations from the Pilot Fitness Aviation Rulemaking Committee on mental health screening for pilots. It also mandates the evaluation and updating of standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. These provisions address safety concerns raised by past aviation incidents. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act (P.L. 112-90) included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, and raising civil penalties for violations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432) mandated positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by human error. The NTSB lists safety improvements to minimize operator distractions causing transportation accidents. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. A provision in the FAST Act in 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The NTSB has historically received funding through a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations. The agency has not needed to use its emergency fund or seek additional funding in over a decade. Funding levels since FY2007 and the FY2017 funding request are detailed in Table 1. The NTSB has not required emergency funds or extra appropriations for more than ten years. The Government Accountability Office evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, with recommendations being implemented by the NTSB in response. GAO found improvements were needed in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management. The GAO recommended that senior leaders at the NTSB develop a specific strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current safety issues include the recoverability of vehicle recorders in accidents and privacy of data collected during investigations. Legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding for railroad accident investigations. In 2008, the NTSB requested a staff increase of 22% to carry out its mission effectively. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 to fulfill its mission. Staffing has increased by 12% since FY2007, with a focus on addressing competency gaps and increasing diversity. Limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including some pipeline and railroad accidents. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to investigate all fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB has concerns about staffing shortages and skill gaps in critical fields, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB Training Center was completed in 2003 at George Washington University. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, completed in 2003, has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency despite offering training for NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel. Revenues from fees have not covered the facility's costs, leading to increased reliance on leases and rentals for non-transportation safety purposes. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA has faced financial challenges despite offering training for NTSB staff and industry personnel. The center has not been able to fully recover costs, leading to increased reliance on leases and rentals for non-transportation safety purposes. The GAO identified issues with lease negotiations and recommended possible remedies, including vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA has improved utilization and cost recovery, but still struggles to recoup all operating costs. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the facility before the expiration of the existing lease agreement. The NTSB's ability to make changes before the lease agreement expires may be limited due to oversight hearings. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, but challenges exist in recovering them promptly after accidents, especially in submerged aircraft. Privacy concerns also arise regarding public disclosures and non-accident uses of recorder data. Recovery of recorders has been difficult in recent accidents, such as Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing after disappearing during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The NTSB issued safety recommendations for overwater flights to transmit data on impact location and carry recorders for essential flight data retrieval. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology like automatic deployable flight recorders. The bill requires large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology, similar to NTSB safety recommendations. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro raised concerns over locating maritime voyage data recorders. Under SOLAS, certain vessels must carry voyage data recorders, which can be retrievable fixed-mount units or float-free units. New regulations stipulate that new ships must have both types of recorders. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability characteristics of maritime voyage data recorders, but concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in potential options to assist investigators in the recovery of data from vessels lost in deep water. Event recorders are assisting accident investigators across all modes of transportation, raising questions about privacy and the potential use of data outside investigative proceedings. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 would prohibit access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles, allowing access only with owner consent, for vehicle diagnostics, in emergencies, for safety research, and by authorized authorities. It also mandates a study on data retention periods and regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Administration is tasked with studying and reporting to Congress on the appropriate time event data recorders should capture vehicle-related data for investigating motor vehicle crashes. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, prompting the Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 to authorize appropriations for NTSB railroad accident investigations and address safety recommendations. The bill addresses NTSB railroad safety recommendations by requiring specific plans for positive train control systems, establishing authority for grants, and directing a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents. Funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations has been authorized to address resource limitations."
