    "content": "The report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and discretionary funding amounts, but does not cover mandatory funding or other related legislation. The report also explains specialized budgetary concepts in the Appendix. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations legislation involving specialized budgetary concepts related to DHS programs and activities. It explains terms such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority, with calculations using unrounded data for precision. Data for FY2019 appropriations are derived from the conference. The data in this report for FY2019 appropriations is derived from various legislative acts, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, and supplemental appropriations acts. Data for FY2020 requested, recommended, and enacted levels are also included from corresponding legislative documents. Levels of annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security are drawn from legislative documents such as S.Rept. 116-125 and P.L. 116-93. The scoring methodology used in this report is consistent and developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. Previous CRS reports on DHS appropriations no longer include OMB data on mandatory spending for consistency. This section provides an overview of the legislative process for FY2020 appropriations for DHS. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020, representing a 4.6% increase from the previous year. This request was part of an overall budget estimated to be $92.08 billion, including various funding sources. The budget proposal was delayed due to a lapse in FY2019 appropriations. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020, with additional funding for FEMA and the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, including $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.12 billion above the Administration's request. The House and Senate committees marked up bills for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with increased funding levels compared to FY2019. The Senate bill included $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion. This increase was mainly due to $5 billion allocated for border barrier construction. The House and Senate committees included increased funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020. The Senate bill allocated $5 billion for border barrier construction, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion. Additionally, the Senate committee bill included more discretionary funding for various agencies and $17.35 billion for disaster relief. Congress passed a continuing resolution to extend funding through December 20, 2019. The FY2020 presidential campaign is related to various sections including accelerated apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund, extension of authorization for the National Flood Insurance Program, and allocation of funds for DHS management activities. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure included $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, slightly below the Administration's request but above the FY2019 enacted level. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure included $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 enacted level. The bill allocated funds for FEMA in disaster relief funding and OCO designated funding for the Coast Guard. It was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law on December 20, 2019. The homeland security appropriations bill provides funding for all DHS departments and components, with discretionary appropriations making up the majority of the budget. The DHS budget includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Annual appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction. When DHS was established in 2003, existing account structures were used for appropriations. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure to standardize appropriations format. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and programs has hindered transparency and decision-making. After years of negotiations, DHS implemented its first budget request in the Common Appropriations Structure for FY2017, converting legacy appropriations to four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. These categories cover operating expenses, asset planning and deployment, technology development, and grant funding. O&S and PC&I appropriations are common among components, while R&D appropriations are less common. The Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay appropriations have unique funding structures within the DHS budget, with the former having a net-zero impact on discretionary spending and the latter supporting retired Coast Guard personnel entitlements. The Retired Pay appropriation for retired Coast Guard personnel is categorized as appropriated mandatory spending, not impacting discretionary allocation. FEMA receives separate appropriations for disaster relief activities, ensuring transparency in funding availability. The National Flood Insurance Program has both mandatory and discretionary spending components. Certain program costs, including mission support, floodplain management, and flood mapping, are funded through discretionary appropriations. Other costs, such as operating expenses and salaries related to flood insurance operations, are covered by fees collected by the government. Provisions in appropriations and general provisions provide directions on how budget authority can be used. In the FY2017 act, these provisions were grouped as \"administrative provisions\" at the ends of titles where components are funded. This practice has continued in subsequent years. This report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's enacted measure. Provisions may be adjusted or dropped due to various reasons, including the priorities of different chambers. The report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, grouping components into Law Enforcement Operational, Incident Response and Recovery Operational, and Support Components. The Department of Homeland Security is divided into Law Enforcement Operational, Incident Response and Recovery Operational, and Support Components. Each group and component's role is briefly described, along with their FY2019 enacted and FY2020 appropriations. Law enforcement operational components are funded in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection responsible for securing borders and facilitating lawful travel. The Department of Homeland Security includes several key components responsible for securing America's borders, preventing terrorism, providing transportation security, maritime safety, and protecting national leaders and designated buildings. The United States Secret Service (USSS) is responsible for protecting national leaders, designated buildings, and investigating financial crimes. The House Appropriations Committee dropped several provisions from the FY2019 act in H.R. 3931, including ones related to ICE funding, TSA monitoring, USCG funding allocation, TSA screening pilot program, and USCG mission maintenance. The TSA pilot program for screening services at locations other than primary passenger terminals, USCG Operations Systems Center mission and staffing maintenance, prohibition of competitions to privatize USCG National Vessel Documentation Center activities, alteration of USCG Civil Engineering program activities with funds, and DHS collaboration with local governments on siting border barriers were key provisions in the bill. 36 administrative provisions were included in P.L. 116-93, with modifications to four provisions and addition of six new ones. The FY2019 act saw dropped provisions, modifications to four provisions, and inclusion of six new administrative provisions. Funding for operational components, including FEMA and the newly restructured Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act. CISA, formerly known as the National Protection and Programs Directorate, promotes information sharing for cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), formerly known as the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), promotes information sharing to mitigate cyber and physical threats to infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leads efforts to protect the US from natural disasters, terrorism, and other hazards through a comprehensive emergency management system. Table 4 shows budgetary resources for these components controlled through appropriations legislation, including non-Title III funding for FEMA in FY2019. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 3931 had eight administrative provisions in Title III, with changes from FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 2582 had six administrative provisions in Title III, dropping three from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee dropped three administrative provisions from Title III in P.L. 116-93, Div. D, including waivers for SAFER Act grants. No new provisions were added, and some provisions were modified. Funding for support components is typically in Title IV of the annual DHS appropriations bill, with changes in funding appearing more significant when expressed as a percentage. USCIS administers U.S. immigration laws, while FLETC is a training school for law enforcement professionals. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is a technical training school for law enforcement professionals, while the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) leads research and development for DHS. The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) focuses on defending against weapons of mass destruction. Budgetary resources for these components are detailed in appropriations legislation. H.R. 3931 dropped two administrative provisions related to USCIS background checks for immigration benefits. H.R. 3931 dropped two administrative provisions related to USCIS background checks for immigration benefits from FY2019. S. 2582 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee had nine administrative provisions in Title IV, with one provision dropped from the FY2019 act. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes seven administrative provisions in Title IV, with two provisions dropped from the FY2019 act and one new provision added. Funding for headquarters components is traditionally found in Title I of the annual DHS appropriations act. The Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) provides central leadership and oversight for all DHS components. The Departmental Management Directorate (DM) offers mission support services. Analysis and Operations (A&O) includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS). The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to ensure DHS efficiency and effectiveness. Budgetary resources for these components are controlled through appropriations legislation. The Management Directorate oversees DHS components and prevents waste, fraud, and abuse. Table 8 breaks down budget resources controlled through appropriations legislation. The House bill for DHS headquarters components had administrative provisions, including a new one for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The Senate bill had six provisions. The House bill included a new provision for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman, while the Senate bill had six administrative provisions. The final appropriations act retained all previously enacted provisions without substantive modifications and included the new provision with minor changes. The annual DHS appropriations act contains general provisions that provide guidance or structure to DHS appropriations, with little more than updates to effective dates or amounts. The FY2019 DHS appropriations act included 40 general provisions, while H.R. 3931 carried 36 provisions, with some modifications and additions. Several provisions from the FY2019 act were not retained in H.R. 3931, including restrictions on detainee transfers, hiring unauthorized workers, and implementing the Arms Trade Treaty. S. 2582 had 36 general provisions in Title V. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill, S. 2582, included 36 general provisions in Title V, with some modifications and additions. Three provisions from the FY2019 act were modified, while three others were dropped. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 40 general provisions, with two provisions dropped from the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act. In P.L. 116-93, Div. D, Title V included 40 general provisions. Two provisions were dropped from the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act. No new policy-related provisions were added, but there were rescissions totaling over $750 million. Some provisions directly impact funding in the bill, including funding for Financial Systems Modernization and Presidential Residence Protection costs. Financial Systems Modernization is managed by the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer. The Financial Systems Modernization is managed by the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer. Presidential Residence Protection Cost grants are managed by FEMA. H.R. 3931 included funding for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants but not for Financial Systems Modernization. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included $41 million for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations are included in the bill to reduce the net funding level. For FY2019, $303 million in rescissions were included in Division A of P.L. 116-6. The Administration proposed rescinding $250 million in prior-year funding for FY2020. Section 536 of H.R. 3931 included $657 million in rescissions from other areas. The rescissions in the funding bill included $657 million from various appropriations, with the largest cut being $601 million from CBP's PC&I appropriation. Additionally, P.L. 116-93 included $754 million in rescissions, including $300 million from unobligated balances in the DRF and $233 million from CBP appropriations for humanitarian care and facility improvements. The FY2020 DHS appropriations process involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays. Budget authority is determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and sets the amount available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress. Payments are made to liquidate obligations, with actual amounts reflected in the budget as outlays. Congressional clients can consult CRS experts for additional perspectives on DHS appropriations. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year, with obligations incurred when agencies engage in transactions creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays represent the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory funds provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, includes budget authority and outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require annual appropriations. Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government through business-type transactions, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus fee or fund collections that offset it. Mandatory spending elements are typically entitlement programs where eligible entities meet established qualifications by law. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget also contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. Congressional budget process determines the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS. The DHS budget process involves two stages: Congress sets spending totals in the annual budget resolution, which are then allocated to committees as 302(a) allocations. These funds are further allocated to subcommittees for each appropriations bill as 302(b) allocations, ensuring budget discipline. Adjustments can be made throughout the year by the appropriations committee. The appropriations committee can adjust allocations during the year, with revised suballocations reported as appropriations bills progress. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending, with subsequent legislation amending those caps. Amendments in the House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill put the bill over its 302(b) discretionary allocation, but these provisions were not included in the final appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending, with subsequent legislation amending those caps. Most of the budget for DHS is considered nondefense spending. The Act allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other purposes. Adjustments for disaster relief were determined by the Office of Management and Budget using a specific formula until FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief adjustments, increasing the allowable adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This adjustment capacity can now carry over indefinitely. In August 2019, OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history, calculated based on a 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending, and carryover from the previous year. The final FY2020 adjustment may still vary. The estimated allowable adjustment for FY2020 is $6.6 billion from emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012 and $3.0 billion from the previous year, totaling $9.6 billion. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still change."
