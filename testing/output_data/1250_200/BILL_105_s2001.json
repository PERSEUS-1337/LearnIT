Congress enacted a demonstration program in 1988 under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to test direct billing for health services provided to patients eligible for reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs. The program, which began in fiscal year 1989, resulted in increased collections and reduced turn-around time for payments. The demonstration program in 1988 tested direct billing for health services to eligible patients, resulting in reduced turn-around time for payments. Direct involvement of tribes in billing and collection is more beneficial, enabling tribes to manage their own billings and collections efficiently. This approach reduces administrative costs for the Indian Health Service and aligns with the Indian Self-Determination Act. The Indian Self-Determination Act aims to empower tribes to manage their health care programs. The demonstration program, initially set to expire in 1996, was extended to 1998. It is recommended to make the program permanent and expand participation to other Indian tribes and organizations. SEC. 3. DIRECT BILLING OF MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is amended to establish a Direct Billing Program for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the medicare program, medicaid program, or from other third-party payors. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is amended to establish a Direct Billing Program for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the medicare program, medicaid program, or from other third-party payors. The program allows hospitals and clinics to be reimbursed directly under the medicare and medicaid programs for services furnished without certain restrictions, with funds used for necessary improvements to comply with program requirements. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is amended to establish a Direct Billing Program for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the medicare program, medicaid program, or from other third-party payors. The program allows hospitals and clinics to be reimbursed directly under the medicare and medicaid programs for services furnished without certain restrictions, with funds used for necessary improvements to comply with program requirements. Funds reimbursed in excess of the amount needed for conditions maintenance must be used solely for improving the health resources deficiency level of the Indian tribe, in accordance with applicable regulations. Audits are required for the hospitals and clinics participating in the program, subject to all auditing requirements applicable to programs administered by the Service and facilities in the medicare and medicaid programs. The Secretary shall monitor the performance of participating hospitals and clinics through quarterly reports. The Secretary monitors hospitals and clinics in the program, requiring quarterly reports for the first 2 years and annual reports thereafter. Participants in the previous program only need to submit annual reports. No payments from special funds are allowed during a hospital or clinic's participation period. To participate in the program, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Alaska Native health organization must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating eligibility and compliance with program requirements. The facility must also be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid programs and meet Service-operated program standards. No special funds payments are permitted during participation. To participate in the program, a facility must meet Service-operated program standards, be accredited by the Secretary's designated body, or have an approved accreditation plan. The Secretary must review and approve applications within 90 days, with participants from the previous demonstration program automatically approved for the new program. The Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 allows automatic approval for participation in the program without the need for an application. Approval or deemed approval of applications will remain valid as long as requirements are met. The Secretary will continuously examine and implement administrative changes to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement under the program. The Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 streamlines approval for program participation without applications. The Secretary will make administrative changes for direct billing and reimbursement, including agreements with States and consistent medical records reporting. Accounting requirements for participants align with the previous demonstration program. The Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 allows for changes in accounting information submission requirements. Participants can withdraw from the program similar to tribes retroceding a contracted program. Cost accounting and billing authority will return to the Secretary upon withdrawal. Conforming amendments in the Social Security Act allow certain Indian tribes to directly bill for healthcare services. The Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 allows tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill for and receive payment for healthcare services provided by their hospitals or clinics. Amendments in the Social Security Act provide the authority for this billing process, with an effective date of October 1, 1998."
