The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" establishes spending limits for fiscal year 2016 to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made by the House or Senate Committee on the Budget for enforcement and budgetary purposes. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allows adjustments to appropriations for fiscal year 2016, with limits on budget authority for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism not exceeding $58 billion. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets spending limits for bills in the House and Senate, exempting certain functions like Social Security and Medicare. It also enforces discretionary and direct spending caps through sequestration. Implementation of sequesters involves separate implementation for discretionary spending limits and direct spending enforcement. Direct spending sequestration is carried out according to specific sections of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, with exemptions for certain categories like military personnel, Medicare, Social Security, veterans, and discretionary appropriations. Presidential orders can be modified in this process. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for modifications to Presidential sequestration orders, with specific criteria for bills or joint resolutions to override the order in the House of Representatives and the Senate. A point of order is established to prevent consideration of measures that alter a sequestration order without Budget Committee certification. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for modifications to Presidential sequestration orders, with specific criteria for bills or joint resolutions to override the order in the House of Representatives and the Senate. A point of order is established to prevent consideration of measures that alter a sequestration order without Budget Committee certification, ensuring the same levels of reductions in new budget authority and outlays as set forth in the order. TITLE II--CAP\n\nSEC. 201. LIMIT ON TOTAL SPENDING.\n\nDefinitions amended to include GDP as gross domestic product for fiscal year. Caps enforced to limit GDP outlays. The section enforces GDP outlay limits based on projected GDP estimates for fiscal years 2016 to 2025. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines the GDP outlay limit for each budget year, including all federal outlays. Total federal outlays, including on-budget and off-budget outlays, will be enforced through sequestration as per the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs such as military personnel, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest are exempt from this enforcement. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits considering any legislation that would exceed current GDP outlay limits. TITLE III--BALANCE\n\nSEC. 301. REQUIREMENT FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO BE SUBMITTED TO STATES. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot borrow more until a balanced budget amendment is sent to states, limiting outlays to receipts, setting spending limits as a percentage of GDP, and requiring a \\2/3\\ vote for tax increases. Bills causing additional borrowing cannot be considered until the amendment is transmitted."
