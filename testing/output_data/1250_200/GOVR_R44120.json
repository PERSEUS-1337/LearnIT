    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills, which impact military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues in the FY2016 NDAA, comparing House and Senate versions. The FY2016 NDAA was passed by the House and Senate, vetoed by the President due to exceeding defense spending caps, and later modified to comply with revised spending limits. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense categories. The initial bill (H.R. 1735) was modified to comply with revised spending caps while retaining military personnel provisions. The revised NDAA was substituted for an unrelated bill (S. 1356), passed by the House and Senate, and signed by the President. Cost estimates were issued by the Congressional Budget Office on various dates in 2015. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2015 NDAA. The National Defense Authorization Act addressed military personnel issues, including changes in authorized end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress increased personnel strength for the Army and Marine Corps but began reversing these increases due to the withdrawal of U.S. forces and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were as follows: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). The Administration's proposed military personnel reductions include the Army aiming to decrease to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017 and the Marine Corps to 175,000-182,000 by FY2017-2019. The final bill authorizes end-strengths similar to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal minimum end-strength requirements for the armed forces. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted the minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC 619 downward, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel levels by up to 2% below authorized end-strengths. Service Secretaries were also given authority to decrease personnel levels by up to 2% in active components and Selected Reserve. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted the minimum end-strengths downward by up to 2%, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel levels. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The authorized end strengths for various reserve components have shifted between FY2001 and FY2015, with notable decreases in Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. For FY2016, proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength include Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, while increases are proposed for Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. Coast Guard Reserve's authorized strength remains unchanged. The administration proposed no change in the authorized strength for the Coast Guard Reserve in FY2016. The end-strengths authorized in the enacted bill were identical to the Administration's request. Concerns about military personnel costs and recruiting high-quality personnel have led to continued focus on the military pay raise, with a 2.3% increase in basic pay for 2016 unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. The FY2016 military pay raise was proposed to be 1.3%, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The Department of Defense plans to limit pay increases through FY2020, with projected raises of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The initial House bill did not specify a pay raise rate, but there is support for a 2.3% increase for FY2016. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. President Obama set the pay raise at 1.3% and the final bill froze the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) freezes the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels, while maintaining the 1.3% pay raise set by President Obama for fiscal year 2016. The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) provided recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services, with Congress incorporating many of the proposed changes. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service by December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) changes the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service by December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received congressional and media attention, with provisions in the bill addressing legal procedures, policies, programs, and data collection for military sexual assaults. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about military sexual assaults, including provisions for retaliation and care for male victims. It enhances the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifies requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted social retaliation faced by victims, with 53% experiencing some form of retaliation. The Government Accountability Office also emphasized the need for improved care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about military sexual assaults, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. This follows the decision to allow women to serve in all military occupations with no exceptions. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 established gender-neutral occupational performance standards, and subsequent legislation directed the Department of Defense on their development and application. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness, potentially requiring validation efforts. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies affecting females. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies affecting females from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days. This change provides a more definitive timeline for implementation for the Department of Defense and reduces the amount of time Congress has to review and act on proposed changes. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, which could impact servicemembers, families, and readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD millions annually and reduce troops separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates financial literacy training at entry and throughout a servicemember's career for life changes or transitions. The statutory requirements for enlistment in the active component differ slightly from those in the reserve components. Enlistees must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or meet specific criteria under the Compact of Free Association. Exceptions can be made for enlistment in the national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or individuals who have previously served in the armed forces to enlist. The enacted bill did not link eligibility requirements for reserve and active components. Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) in 2004, but later approved the more generous Post-9/11 GI Bill, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) in favor of the more generous Post-9/11 GI Bill. The enacted bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the date of enactment and allowed current REAP beneficiaries to exhaust their entitlement. Only those using REAP in the enrollment period immediately prior to the date of enactment could continue to use the program. The initial Senate bill proposed a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans, but the enacted bill did not include this provision. The card would have identified veterans and allowed for discounts at national retail chains. The enacted bill did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans. Veterans can utilize state-issued ID cards or obtain an ID card through the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal to prove their military service. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans with proof of military service. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces through the use of bonuses and incentives. Section 531 of H.R. 1735 authorizes service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes this provision, allowing for up to 20% of the fiscal year accession target to receive incentives subject to a 30-day congressional review. More information on recruitment and retention can be found in CRS Report RL32965. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 provides reservists with the right to reemployment after military service, with exemptions for certain types of duty. New mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations of reservists for disaster response. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 introduced new activation authorities for reservists, allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit. Section 565 of the House bill exempts military duty under these new authorities from counting towards the five-year limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. For more information on USERRA and mobilization authorities, refer to CRS Report RL30802. A veteran is defined as a person who served in active military, naval, or air service and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service includes full-time service in various branches of the military, as well as certain training periods where injuries or diseases were incurred in the line of duty. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are not activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran unless they complete the required active service. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service, but they are not necessarily considered veterans unless they have completed the required active duty. The House-passed bill initially proposed to honor reservists who qualify for reserve retirement as veterans, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off from their military career for work/life balance. For more information on veterans' benefits, burial benefits, and Reserve Component retirement benefits, refer to CRS Reports R42324, R41386, and RL30802 respectively. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off from their military career for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. Participants must return to active duty and accept additional service obligations. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. DOD is required to submit a final assessment to Congress on the pilot program by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on program participation by members of the Armed Forces serving under an agreement. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would remove restrictions on the Career Intermission Program, allowing more members of the Armed Forces to participate. This change includes removing limits on the number of annual participants and expanding eligibility criteria. Congress aims to improve recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce, particularly by incentivizing high-performing military personnel to seek acquisition assignments. Military acquisition professionals play a crucial role in overseeing funding for defense programs, and there is a push for a qualified and high-performing workforce in this area. The Goldwater-Nichols Act incentivized officers to be educated in joint matters for promotions. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and allows for a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to include acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. Background: Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code allows the Secretary of Defense to set policies on carrying firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current policies restrict carrying government-issued firearms to personnel on duty. Following recent active shooter incidents, questions have been raised about the adequacy of force protection measures at military installations and the need to potentially modify DOD policies to allow servicemembers to carry personal firearms. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would give more flexibility to commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action, including by friendly fire or terrorist attacks. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action, including by friendly fire or terrorist attacks. There is a debate over whether servicemembers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing should be eligible for the Purple Heart, with some arguing they were victims of terrorism and others saying they were victims of domestic terrorism. Eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. The FY2015 NDAA expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. The law redefined what constitutes an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for Purple Heart eligibility, requiring communication with the organization before the attack and motivation by it. However, servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The Oklahoma City bombing victims will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. Congress has addressed the issue of military working dogs in previous legislation, including allowing for the adoption of retired dogs by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 and FY2013 expanded eligibility for adopting Military Working Dogs (MWDs) to include handlers and their family members. The current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. Congress passed a provision in Section 342 of the NDAA for FY2015 requiring DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and give adoption priority to former handlers. The Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates that all military working dogs must be retired only after being returned to the US, facilitating domestic transfer for adoption. Critics argue that the lack of appropriated funds for transferring retiring MWDs from abroad will be costly. The President's budget proposals for FY2015 and FY2016 included significant cuts to the Defense Commissary System, aiming to reduce subsidies by $1 billion over three years. However, funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA, adding $100 million to the budget and requiring a study on cost reductions. The proposed cuts could impact operating hours and costs for goods and services at commissaries, affecting authorized patrons including military members, veterans, and DOD civilians. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary System and military exchange system. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report by March 1, 2016, detailing a plan to achieve budget-neutrality by October 1, 2018, including potential modifications like privatization or closure of commissaries. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report by March 1, 2016, detailing potential modifications to achieve budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary System and military exchange system. This includes options such as privatization, closure of commissaries, and analyzing pricing constructs to enhance benefits. The report will also consider previous legislation and studies, including Section 634 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Additionally, Section 652 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The report pertains to TRICARE, a health care program for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed changes to TRICARE plans, including consolidating options, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and introducing a new enrollment fee. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE plans, including consolidating options, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and introducing a new enrollment fee. However, these proposals were not adopted in the final bill, and Congress may consider major changes to TRICARE benefits in the future. The Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission also made recommendations for TRICARE changes, but they were not endorsed by the President or included in the bill. The committee recommends a deliberate approach to TRICARE reform legislation to understand implications and improve access to care, outcomes, and cost control. Comprehensive reform of the military health care system is essential for enhancing care experience, maintaining readiness, and ensuring cost-effectiveness. The current system needs modernization to meet evolving healthcare needs. To modernize and improve the military healthcare system, all elements must be reevaluated, including potential increases to fees and co-pays. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options, with active duty servicemembers having no pharmacy copayments at military pharmacies or through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments at military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for prescriptions written by civilian and military providers. DOD policy favors generic medications over brand-name ones. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy copays and mandated refills for maintenance drugs to be filled through lower cost options. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller pharmacy copayment increases than initially proposed. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase to pharmacy copayments, raising copays for prescriptions filled at retail and mail-order pharmacies. The increase is estimated to reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. This change contrasts with the Administration's proposal for annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. The then-Secretary of Defense Hagel ordered a 90-day review of the military health system, resulting in an action plan. Some Members of Congress are interested in the follow-up plan's implementation. Sections 711 and 731 to 735 of the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics through public access and reports to Congress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include these provisions, making it less demanding and presumably less costly. Access to contraception remains a concern, with TRICARE covering various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and ensure all women in the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception methods. The enacted bill requires comprehensive counseling on contraception methods for all women in the Armed Forces."
