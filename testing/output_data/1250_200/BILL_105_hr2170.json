    "content": "CHAPTER 90--MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: This section adds a new chapter to the United States Code regarding reimbursement for adoption expenses under Subpart G of part III of title 5. Sec. 9001 of the United States Code defines adoption benefits as reasonable and necessary expenses directly related to the adoption of a child, including fees charged by adoption agencies, legal fees, counseling fees, and medical expenses. The regulations establish a program for agency employees to be reimbursed for adoption expenses, including medical care for the child, physical examinations for the adopting parent, foster-care charges, and transportation expenses. Reimbursement is provided after the adoption becomes final, the child is under 18 years old and unmarried, and with a complete written application. Reimbursement for adoption expenses under this program is limited to $2,000 per child and is only payable if other state or federal benefits do not cover the full amount. If both adopting parents are eligible, each can receive reimbursement, but the total amount cannot exceed $5,000. The guidelines for adoption expense reimbursement include a limit of $5,000, with provisions for interagency cooperation. Payments are made from the appropriate fund, and marital status cannot be a basis for denial. The Office of Personnel Management may issue necessary guidelines for uniform administration, and agencies must comply with these regulations. Assistance may be provided upon request to carry out this section. The Act introduces amendments to title 5 and title 39 of the United States Code regarding annuities, insurance, and miscellaneous benefits. It specifies the applicability of Section 9001 to Postal Service employees and sets the effective date for the Act to be October 1, 1997."
