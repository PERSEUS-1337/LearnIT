In the post-World War II era, corporate tax revenue as a share of GDP peaked in 1952 at 6.1% and has since declined. Currently, corporate tax revenue is around 1.3% of GDP, but projections suggest it may increase to over 2.4% in the future. Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues also showing relative stability at around 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. At its peak in 1952, the corporate tax generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue. The corporate tax has decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources. In 1952, it generated 32.1% of federal tax revenue, but now only accounts for 8.9%. Factors such as tax rate reductions and changes in the tax base have contributed to this decline. The decline in corporate tax revenue can be attributed to a lower average effective tax rate and a reduction in the corporate tax base. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate. This, along with changes in tax credits and deductions, has led to a decrease in corporate tax revenue. The effective corporate tax rate has been reduced over time due to changes in tax credits, deductions, and depreciation rules. Special tax credits, deductions, and the Section 199 deduction have all contributed to lowering the effective tax rate. Additionally, changes in depreciation rules since 1954 have also played a role in reducing the effective tax rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed the trend of rapid capital recovery by aligning tax depreciation with physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. Despite a general decline, there were spikes in the average effective tax rate in 2000 and 2007 during recessions. Businesses can use current losses to offset taxes. In response to recessions in 2000 and 2007, businesses used current losses to reduce taxes. However, the two-year carryback period was not sufficient for large losses, leading to higher taxes for struggling corporations. Congress extended the carryback period to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. Additionally, the decline in corporate tax revenue is also attributed to a shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base due to the increasing use of partnerships and S corporations. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has decreased as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. C corporations' share of business income decreased from 78% in 1980 to 44% in 2007, while partnerships' share rose from 3% to 28% and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. This change in income distribution has also affected the distribution of businesses themselves. The distribution of businesses changed over time, with C corporations decreasing from 17% in 1980 to 6% in 2007, while S corporations increased from 4% to 12%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 incentivized businesses to organize as S corporations. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has also decreased, impacting the tax base. The net asset component and profit component in the corporate sector measure the return on productive resources. Corporate profitability has significantly declined since 1966. Economists attribute this decline to factors such as industry shifts and changes in the age of corporations. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 can be attributed to several factors. These include a potential increase in the number of corporations experiencing losses, a shift towards younger and less profitable firms, profit-shifting to lower-tax countries, and discrepancies in reported income for tax and financial accounting purposes. This has led to a decrease in corporate tax revenues over the past six decades. The decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades can be attributed to three main factors: a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, a shift towards pass-through business structures like partnerships and S corporations, and a decline in corporate sector profitability. Understanding these factors is crucial for the ongoing tax reform debate, which aims to reduce statutory rates and broaden the tax base. The effective tax rate is usually below the statutory tax rate, allowing for a possible reduction in the top corporate tax rate. Research suggests that reducing the rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Other reforms may include changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas to reduce profit shifting. As the corporate rate is reduced and tax reforms are enacted, business activity may return to the corporate sector, naturally broadening the tax base. The section provides an overview of the mathematics behind calculating average effective tax rates. Table A-1 shows data sources and descriptions for variables used in the calculation. Equations for the average effective tax corporate rate (AECTR) include identifiers for federal and state/local levels."
