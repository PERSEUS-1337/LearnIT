    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. Additionally, eligible employees can receive up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered military servicemember. Employees must meet certain criteria to be eligible for FMLA leave. The FMLA eligibility requirements include working for a covered employer, having 1,250 hours of service in the past 12 months, working at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and having worked for the employer for 12 months. The FMLA also applies to public agencies and has been amended multiple times since its passage in 1993. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since its passage in 1993. In the 114th Congress, several bills were introduced to amend the FMLA, proposing new entitlements, expanding permissible leave categories, and modifying employee eligibility requirements. One proposal included creating Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave, allowing eligible employees up to four hours of leave in a 30-day period for certain family and medical needs. H.R. 5518 and H.R. 5535 would provide eligible employees with leave for school conferences, medical care needs, and parental involvement. Employees could take up to four hours of leave in a 30-day period for various reasons, with a maximum of 24 or 48 hours in a 12-month period. Notification to employers at least seven days in advance would be required for using this leave. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand qualifying uses of FMLA leave, including bereavement, domestic violence-related needs, family involvement, and medical needs for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Eligible employees may currently use FMLA leave for various reasons such as caring for a new child, a serious health condition, or a family member, and for certain military family needs. The proposals considered by the 114th Congress aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlements for bereavement, domestic violence-related needs, and family involvement. S. 1302 / H.R. 2260 would have allowed employees to use FMLA for the death of a son or daughter, while S. 473 would have extended this to include a parent or sibling. Additionally, S. 473 would have permitted FMLA use for domestic violence situations involving the employee or their child or parent. Employees could use family involvement leave for school-related activities or medical appointments for family members. The proposed bills aimed to expand FMLA entitlements for hospital care for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Other proposals sought to broaden the relationships for which employees could take family leave. The current law allows employees to use FMLA leave for various family-related reasons, including caring for a new child, a family member with a serious health condition, or a military member. The law defines family members broadly to include biological, adopted, or foster children, stepchildren, legal wards, and individuals standing in loco parentis. Military exigency leave and military caregiver leave are also available for specific family members in certain situations. The legislative proposals aimed to expand FMLA leave for caregiving purposes, including adding domestic partners, adult children, parents-in-law, grandparents, and siblings as eligible family members for caregiving needs. This would allow employees to use leave for the arrival of a new child or for a family member's serious health condition. S. 473, H.R. 5519, and H.R. 5701 proposed expanding FMLA leave eligibility to include various family members like domestic partners, adult children, parents-in-law, grandparents, and siblings for caregiving needs. The 114th Congress considered legislation to broaden FMLA leave eligibility by adding various family members like domestic partners, adult children, parents-in-law, grandparents, and siblings for caregiving needs. Proposed changes included expanding the definition of \"son or daughter\" to include children of any age, allowing for leave to care for adult children. The 114th Congress considered legislation to broaden FMLA leave eligibility by adding various family members like domestic partners, adult children, parents-in-law, grandparents, and siblings for caregiving needs. Proposed changes included expanding the definition of \"son or daughter\" to include children of any age, allowing for leave to care for adult children. The legislation aimed to amend the FMLA definition of a serious health condition to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation, specifying that such recovery alone does not constitute a serious health condition. The 114th Congress considered proposals to broaden FMLA leave eligibility by adding various family members for caregiving needs. Two proposals aimed to amend general eligibility requirements for employees seeking FMLA leave, including reducing the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite and amending the hours-of-service requirement. Two bills proposed changes to FMLA eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities. H.R. 5165 aimed to provide FMLA-qualifying leave for veterans with a disability rated at 30% or higher, with separate eligibility criteria. The bill allowed certain veterans to access FMLA leave without meeting the standard 12 months and 1,250 hours of employment requirement. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs can use leave for medical care related to the disability if employed for a specific period and hours. Certification from a VA medical provider or approved facility is required. Veterans with a service-connected disability not currently rated at 30% or higher but retired from the Armed Forces due to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher are also eligible. The bill proposed eligibility criteria for veterans to use leave for medical care related to their service-connected disability based on their disability rating at the time of retirement. Veterans with a disability rating of 30%-50% would need to be employed for 8 months and 833 hours, while those with a rating of 60% or higher would need 6 months and 625 hours. Certification from the Department of Defense describing the terms of retirement would be required for those with a disability rating of 30% or higher. S. 3444 proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESP) to access FMLA leave. Veterans could access leave sooner based on disability rating at retirement, while ESPs would need to meet a specific hours-of-service requirement. The proposal under S. 3444 introduced separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESPs) to access FMLA leave. ESPs would need to meet a specific hours-of-service requirement, averaging 60 hours per month or 60% of total monthly hours expected for their job description. The Secretary of Labor could establish separate rules for ESPs' leave entitlement without changing its size."
