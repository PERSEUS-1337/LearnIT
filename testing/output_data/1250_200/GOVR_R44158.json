    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure and environmental impacts. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption, with the latter referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. However, it is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to a decrease in water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003, while several eastern states have significantly increased irrigated acres. Since the 1980s, farmers in seven states increased irrigation by 50%, shifting from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. In the West, irrigated land increased by 1.7 million acres while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet. Despite fluctuations, there has been a trend of declining water application since 1998. Groundwater withdrawals have increased in the West, while overall irrigation withdrawals have decreased. Irrigation withdrawals remain highest in the western-most portions of the United States. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. The increase in irrigated acres in the East has been attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. This expansion has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency in this report refers to the beneficial use of applied irrigation water, considering factors like irrigation system performance and crop response. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors like evapotranspiration rates, climate conditions, and water conveyance systems. While efficient systems aim to maintain crop production levels and conserve water, studies have shown that they may lead to increased water consumption in some cases. For example, increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation can result in higher water usage and crop yield. Subsidies for drip irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin could increase water consumption and crop yield, along with expanding irrigated acreage. While some studies support this, it is unclear if nationwide water conservation from expanded irrigation occurs. Microirrigation may be more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically uses less water due to water return through runoff and deep percolation. Efficient irrigation technologies may not always reduce overall water consumption as they could lead to growing more water-intensive crops. Adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may not always reduce overall water consumption. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure and gravity systems, with precision technologies enhancing efficiency. Best management practices focus on water management on farms, including conveyance and scheduling. These practices are based on select practices identified by USDA's NRCS. Some BMPs apply to both pressure and gravity systems, while others are system-specific. Pressure irrigation systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, make up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems used in the United States. Major pressure systems include center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems. The success of best management practices (BMPs) depends on various factors and may require multiple practices for effectiveness. Some BMPs listed could apply to both pressure and gravity irrigation systems. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems, are more efficient than gravity systems for growing crops. These systems require intentional water management to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, maximize plant growth, and increase water efficiency. Irrigation BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, and land leveling are part of an irrigation water management plan. Sprinkler systems spray water over crops for moisture, cooling, frost protection, and dust control, while microirrigation is a low-flow system for efficient water application. Microirrigation systems, including surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation, are efficient methods that apply water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot irrigation systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. Gravity systems, which make up a significant portion of irrigation systems in the United States, divert water to flood over crops through land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Controlled flooding methods increase efficiencies, while uncontrolled flooding is the simplest form of irrigation. Gravity irrigation systems, like basin, border, and furrow irrigation, use land-forming measures to increase efficiencies. Uncontrolled flooding, the oldest form of irrigation, is less efficient. These systems have a low to medium initial cost and medium to high labor requirement. Gravity systems are suitable for close-growing crops like rice, while furrow irrigation can be used for row crops like potato and corn. Irrigation land leveling reshapes fields to ensure uniform water application, reducing erosion and water logging. Canal linings can increase conveyance efficiency by limiting water loss due to seepage. Canal linings are installed to limit water loss in transit to crop areas. Ditch linings can be made from materials like concrete, PVC, and polypropylene. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination. Irrigation reservoirs store water for irrigation, with the size depending on water availability. Precision technologies in irrigation have rapidly grown in recent years. Precision technologies, such as satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones, have been integrated into the agricultural industry, particularly in irrigation. These technologies increase efficiency, reduce costs, and boost crop yield. The collaboration between NASA and USDA led to the launch of the SMAP satellite, which gathers global soil moisture data without the need for terrestrial sensors. This data can help governments and farmers make informed decisions about irrigation practices. Agricultural producers can use data from drones, sensor networks, and data analytics to make informed decisions on irrigation. Information from regional weather networks can help establish an accurate irrigation schedule, while remote monitoring systems can adjust irrigation operations in real-time. The monitoring notification system wirelessly transfers real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing field visits and water usage. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, optimized with computer software, decreases water application and runoff. Implementing irrigation best management practices (BMPs) increases efficiency, lowers production costs, and improves water distribution. Irrigation allows for higher yields, value crops, and extended growing seasons, enhancing specialty crop production by delivering water as needed to prevent overwatering issues. Efficient irrigation systems can save costs by delivering water to crops only when needed, preventing issues from overwatering. These systems can also be used for applying nutrients and pesticides, reducing costs and providing more precise application. Implementation of irrigation technologies in the United States is influenced by factors like cost, crop type, climate, and water availability. Adoption of efficient irrigation systems is often driven by economic gains from increased crop yield rather than water conservation. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems in agriculture is driven by economic gains from increased crop yield rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly systems like drip irrigation, while low-value crop growers may struggle to finance system improvements. The cost of developing a water supply, such as drilling wells or building storage facilities, can also impact a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. The cost of establishing a water supply from groundwater influences a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. High-efficiency systems are common in areas heavily reliant on groundwater, while areas with surface water supplies are less likely to adopt efficient irrigation. Crop type also plays a role, with perennial tree crops better suited for drip irrigation and close-growing crops like rice benefiting from gravity irrigation. Many farmers in the United States struggle to utilize more efficient irrigation systems. Many farmers in the United States face challenges in adopting efficient irrigation systems due to factors like crop type, physical field conditions, and climate. Different soil types also influence the choice of irrigation method, with sandy soils requiring sprinkler or microirrigation systems, while loam and clay soils can accommodate various methods. Climate conditions, such as wind and evapotranspiration rates, further impact the effectiveness of irrigation technologies. Irrigation method selection is influenced by soil type, with sandy soils best suited for sprinkler or microirrigation, while clay soils are ideal for gravity irrigation due to low infiltration rates. Soil surveys aid in planning irrigation systems, considering labor-technology trade-offs between pressure and gravity systems. Water quality, including sediment content, also impacts system choice, with gravity irrigation preferred for sediment-heavy water. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws determine the legal water availability for farmers. The federal government offers financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers through various USDA agencies. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation BMPs adoption through programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding was awarded, with a significant portion going towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, like California and Texas, received the highest funding amounts. Between 2009 and 2014, the USDA provided $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs, with California and Texas receiving the most funding. Groundwater depletion is a concern, with aquifers in the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley being depleted at unsustainable rates. The impact of irrigation BMP funding on reducing groundwater depletion is unclear. Funding for irrigation BMPs is provided through programs like EQIP, CAPs, and CIG. Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) fund local or regional irrigation conservation programs. Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) provides funding for irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs) based on conservation performance. Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) funds similar irrigation BMPs as EQIP but is limited to 16 states with low participation in Federal Crop Insurance. USDA offers technical assistance for irrigation technology adoption through various programs. The USDA provides technical assistance through various programs to help irrigators adopt conservation plans, including the Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program. CTA offers support through a network of conservationists and has funded over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013. Additionally, USDA provides information resources through agencies like the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The USDA provides resources to irrigators through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). ARS focuses on irrigation research, ERS conducts economic studies on irrigation, and NIFA administers funding for agriculture research programs related to irrigation. The USDA provides resources for irrigators through various programs such as the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and the National Water Quality Program (NWQP). National level monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited, with the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) providing the most comprehensive data on irrigation water use. NASS conducts surveys of producers every five years to assess irrigated agriculture, while USGS evaluates water use trends in the United States, including irrigation. The USDA provides resources for irrigators through programs like AFRI Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and NWQP. NASS and USGS provide comprehensive data on irrigation water use.
