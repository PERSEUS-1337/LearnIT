Additionally, the Act includes provisions for the recall of retired judges. The \"Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999\" allows the recall of retired judges for further service on the Court in accordance with specific criteria outlined in the Act. The \"Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999\" allows recall-eligible retired judges to be recalled for up to 90 days (or the equivalent) at a time, not exceeding 180 days (or the equivalent) in a calendar year, upon certification by the chief judge. If a recalled judge declines to serve (except due to disability), the chief judge must remove them from the recall list. A recall-eligible retired judge can be removed from recall status if they are unable to perform the service due to reasons other than disability. If a retired judge becomes permanently disabled and unable to serve further, they will also be removed from recall status. A recalled judge has the same powers and duties as an active judge. The pay for a recall-eligible retired judge varies depending on their retirement status. Under section 7253(e) of this title, a recalled judge who retired under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 will be considered a reemployed annuitant. This does not affect the right of a retired judge to serve as a reemployed annuitant under title 5. SEC. 4 amends Section 7296(b) of title 38, United States Code, to only credit years of service as a judge of the Court for calculating an individual's years of service. Any fractional part of a year less than 183 days will be disregarded, while 183 days or more will be credited as a full year. SEC. 5 addresses judges' retired pay.
