    "content": "A presidential transition involves the transfer of executive power from the incumbent President to the successor, starting with pre-election planning and continuing through inauguration day. It includes vetting candidates, familiarizing the incoming Administration with operations, and developing a policy platform. The importance of a well-organized transition was highlighted after the 9/11 attacks, with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security emphasizing the need to prevent disruptions that could compromise national security. Presidential transitions historically lacked advance planning and cooperation, with little interaction between incoming and outgoing administrations. Candidates often avoided pre-election transition activities to avoid criticism or resource strain. The importance of organized transitions was underscored post-9/11 for national security. The necessity of a well-planned transition to a new Administration has led to a shift in stakeholders' perspectives, with a growing recognition of the importance of pre-election planning. Legislation such as the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 aims to remove the stigma around pre-election transition planning and make it an accepted part of the process. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and subsequent amendments legitimized pre-election planning by candidates, providing services and facilities to transition teams. This commitment of resources highlights the importance of successful presidential transitions for the continuity of government operations. A successful presidential transition facilitates the formation of a new Administration, familiarizes top-level personnel with the federal government operations, and prepares them to govern. The complexity of the federal government is evident in the 4,000 appointments, $4 trillion budget, and 2 million civilian employees across various missions. The 15 executive departments represent only a fraction of the numerous federal entities, showcasing the vastness of governing challenges for a new Administration. In 2008, Bradley Patterson estimated that the President and White House staff needed to fill 7,854 positions, including presidential appointees, federal judicial appointees, White House staff, and noncareer positions. National security is a key issue during presidential transitions, highlighted by the FBI briefing on a potential terrorist attack during Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009. The 2009 threat of a possible attack on the National Mall during the inauguration emphasized the need for both outgoing and incoming Administrations to be well prepared for events. Amendments to the Presidential Transition Act have addressed the need to bolster readiness for transition-related incidents and for the incoming Administration to take immediate responsibility for national security. The most recent amendment, P.L. 114-136, required the Secretary of Homeland Security to report on threats and vulnerabilities facing the United States during a presidential transition. The Presidential Transition Act amendments require government officials to report specific threats to national security and military operations to the President-elect. Outgoing presidents have the power to set public policy through executive orders and directives. Presidents can unilaterally set public policy using various directives. Outgoing presidents may act more decisively in their final months, especially if their successor is from a different party. The transition period allows for policy changes that could impact the incoming administration. The last one hundred days of a presidency bring political certainty as the president prepares for the successor's policies and priorities. During presidential transitions, political uncertainty shifts to certitude as the outgoing president prepares for the successor's policies and priorities. The last one hundred days of a presidency are crucial, as the president's decisions and actions could impact the incoming administration. Incumbent presidents may act unilaterally through executive orders and appointments, potentially affecting their successor and raising congressional concerns. During the presidential transition period, the outgoing president's actions, such as issuing executive orders and making appointments, could impact the incoming administration and raise concerns in Congress. The timing, frequency, and content of these actions may lead to questions about their propriety and force the new president to address objectionable policies. Additionally, decisions made during this period could result in political consequences for the incoming president. During the presidential transition period, the incoming President faces challenges in moving from campaigning to governing, including staffing, agenda setting, and policy formulation. They can use tools like executive orders and political appointments to establish their policy agenda and potentially overturn or modify predecessor's policies. The transition period is crucial for the President-elect, as actions taken before inauguration day have significant implications. The presidential transition period is crucial for the President-elect as actions taken before inauguration day have significant implications. Congress plays a role in transitions through confirmation of appointees, budget process, and oversight. Other activities like executive orders and pardons may also be of interest to Congress. The sections in this report are grouped into three categories related to presidential transition issues. During the presidential transition period, various issues arise, categorized into three groups. Outgoing Administration-related topics include personnel changes, government records, and executive clemency. Cybersecurity and national security are linked to the transition itself. Issues spanning both administrations include agency rulemaking, appointments in the executive and judicial branches, executive orders, and budget submission. Some appointed officials transition to career positions, known as \"burrowing in,\" following laws and regulations for career appointments. These conversions often occur during the transition period between administrations. During the transition period between administrations, appointees are selected noncompetitively for positions such as Schedule C, noncareer SES, or limited tenure SES. These positions involve policy determinations and close relationships with top officials. Schedule C appointees typically receive salaries at GS-12 through GS-15 levels, while SES members receive salaries under the senior executive pay schedule. Career employees are selected based on merit without political influence, with differing tenures compared to noncareer employees. In 2007, Paul Light studied appointees over several Administrations and highlighted the desire of noncareer individuals to \"burrow in\" due to pay, benefits, and job security of career positions. The conversion of appointees to career positions may limit opportunities for other employees and raise concerns about undermining the work of new Administrations. The tension between noncareer and career staff in government can hinder effective operations, as career staff provide continuity and expertise. Effective working relationships between political appointees and career executives are crucial for carrying out new initiatives and reforms. The conversion of appointees to career positions may raise concerns about undermining the work of new Administrations. The SEA's Distinguished Executives Advisory Network developed webinars on managing the transition to a new administration. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by strict procedures and must adhere to merit principles and prohibited personnel practices. The process for selecting career employees in the executive branch must adhere to merit principles and prohibited personnel practices to ensure fairness and openness. Regulations govern career appointments, including rules against discrimination and requirements for public announcements of vacancies. Approval is needed for certain position details, and some SES positions are reserved for career employees. During the Presidential Election Period, specific appointees have additional considerations. During the Presidential Election Period, certain appointees are prohibited from receiving financial awards. These appointees include noncareer SES positions, Schedule C employees, and limited-term positions. Conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions are monitored by OPM and GAO to ensure proper procedures are followed. A 2009 memorandum by OPM Director John Berry established policies regarding political appointees and career civil service positions. The 2009 memorandum by OPM Director John Berry established policies governing OPM's oversight of conversions of employees from appointed to career positions. It required agencies to seek approval before appointing political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions at any level, effective January 1. The 2010 policy by OPM requires approval before appointing political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions. Written authorization is needed for appointing current or recent political Executive Branch employees to such positions. OPM conducts merit staffing reviews for career SES selections involving political appointees before certification by the Qualifications Review Board. Agencies are reminded to carefully review proposed appointments. OPM requires approval before appointing political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions. Written authorization is needed for appointing current or recent political Executive Branch employees to such positions. OPM conducts merit staffing reviews for career SES selections involving political appointees before certification by the Qualifications Review Board. Agencies are reminded to carefully review proposed appointments to ensure they meet merit system principles. OPM Director John Berry delegated decision-making authority over these matters to career Senior Executives at OPM to avoid political influence. Pre-Appointment Checklists for Competitive Service Positions and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions were included as attachments to the OPM memorandum. In a memorandum issued on January 11, 2016, OPM reminded departments and agencies of this policy for the 2016 presidential election year. OPM issued a memorandum in January 2016 outlining policies regarding the appointment of political appointees to competitive or excepted service positions. The memorandum cautioned against creating vacancies solely for political appointees and emphasized adherence to ethical standards. Additionally, the Presidential Transition Guide provides detailed guidance on federal human resources management matters. The Edward \"Ted\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvement Act of 2015 requires the OPM Director to submit annual reports to Congress on these matters. The Transitions Improvement Act of 2015, enacted on March 18, 2016, mandates the OPM Director to provide annual reports to Congress on requests for political appointees in civil service positions. Quarterly reports are also required, with the last one covering the transition period between administrations. Names of appointees may be excluded if deemed appropriate by the OPM Director. The GAO oversees conversions from political to career positions, with a recent evaluation covering the period from January 1, 2010, to October 1, 2015. Out of 69 conversions reported by 28 agencies, almost 50% occurred in six agencies. Positions converted included Schedule C, noncareer SES, presidential appointee, and limited-term SES positions. During the period from January 1, 2010, to October 1, 2015, conversions from noncareer to career positions were reported. These conversions included Schedule C, noncareer SES, presidential appointee, and limited-term SES positions. Some agencies converted political appointees to career positions without OPM approval due to difficulties understanding the approval policy. Congressional oversight of these conversions occurred before and after the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. During the transition between the 114th and 115th Congress, oversight focused on federal agency hiring practices under the Obama administration. A bill was introduced to prevent political appointees from moving into career Civil Service positions for two years. The goal was to maintain merit-based hiring standards. Additionally, letters were sent to various departments requesting information on job appointments. Representative Chaffetz and Senators requested information on federal agency hiring practices, including job openings, documents submitted for employee hiring, and hiring timelines. Concerns were raised about the acceleration of civil service hiring and the need for legitimate, non-politically influenced hiring decisions. Senators also urged President Obama to consider implementing a hiring freeze. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with Senator Thom Tillis, urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except those related to public health or safety, to prevent unfair hiring practices and potential policy undermining. Senator Johnson also requested information on federal employees converting from political appointments to career positions to ensure appropriate hiring practices. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with Senator Thom Tillis, urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except those related to public health or safety, to prevent unfair hiring practices and potential policy undermining. Senator Johnson also requested information on federal employees converting from political appointments to career positions to ensure appropriate hiring practices. Additionally, Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady sent letters requesting information on personnel conversions of noncareer employees to protect the independence of the federal civil service. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with Senator Thom Tillis, urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except those related to public health or safety, to prevent unfair hiring practices and potential policy undermining. Senator Johnson also requested information on federal employees converting from political appointments to career positions to ensure appropriate hiring practices. Additionally, Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady sent letters requesting information on personnel conversions of noncareer employees to protect the independence of the federal civil service. Members of Congress requested the GAO to review political appointee conversions to career federal civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, and the implementation and effectiveness of the OPM policy that became effective on January 1, 2010. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with Senator Thom Tillis, urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except those related to public health or safety, to prevent unfair hiring practices and potential policy undermining. Members of Congress requested the GAO to review political appointee conversions to career federal civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, and the implementation and effectiveness of the OPM policy that became effective on January 1, 2010. The GAO study was requested due to concerns about political appointees 'burrowing in' to civil positions, potentially affecting the integrity of the merit-based federal workforce. Timothy Dirks, then interim president of the Senior Executives Association, commended the Senators for requesting the review, expressing concerns about political employees being placed in Senior Executive positions for which they may be unqualified. Upon publication of GAO's September 30, 2016 findings, Representatives Upton and Chaffetz and Senators Thune and Johnson issued a joint press release on October 6, 2016, expressing concerns about political appointees 'burrowing in' to civil positions and not following proper procedures, leading to favoritism and bias in the federal workforce. They emphasized the importance of transparency in the conversion process to prevent abuse of the system. The Obama administration's failure to follow rules on merit-based hiring, as highlighted by GAO, has raised concerns among lawmakers. They stress the need for proper procedures to prevent favoritism and political interference in federal workforce appointments. The practice of appointee-to-career employee conversions, particularly in the Department of Homeland Security, is seen as a threat to fairness and competition in federal service. Congress is urged to address these issues to uphold the integrity of a merit-based federal workforce. The Obama administration's failure to follow merit-based hiring rules has raised concerns among lawmakers regarding appointee-to-career employee conversions. Congress may need to ensure proper procedures and transparency in these conversions, potentially by directing OPM to report on current policies and consider amending relevant laws. Additionally, Congress could address restrictions on financial awards to politically appointed officers during the Presidential Election Period and increase penalties for violating civil service laws. Congress could consider directing OPM to provide training to federal managers on conversion policies and increase penalties for violating civil service laws. Additionally, standardized reports could be requested on conversions from appointed to career positions to ensure transparency and proper procedures. Congress could consider directing OPM to provide standardized reports on government records generated by outgoing Presidents and their Administration, as well as maintaining easy access to this information for Congress, federal agencies, and the public. The Federal Records Act governs the creation, retention, preservation, and access of federal agency records, presidential records, and records of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the Archivist of the United States overseeing the management of government records. The Archivist of the United States oversees the management of federal government records, including those of Congress and the Supreme Court. Concerns arise during presidential transitions about the potential loss or improper destruction of records, especially with the increasing number of platforms for record creation. Changes since 2009 have impacted record collection and retention, including a new definition of federal records introduced in 2014. The 2016 transition updated the definition of federal records under the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014. The new definition emphasizes recorded information made or received by a Federal agency in connection with public business, regardless of form or characteristics. It shifts focus from physical media to the actual information stored. The previous definition included specific materials, while the amended definition is more generic. The updated definition of federal records under the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 now emphasizes recorded information related to public business, regardless of form. Federal agency staff must ensure proper capture and retention of records as required by law and agency policies. The transition to a new President does not directly impact record collection and retention, but departing political appointees must manage and preserve records in accordance with the Federal Records Act. New appointees in the Administration must also adhere to record-keeping provisions. The Obama Administration introduced various electronic platforms for record-keeping, leading to a more complex process for collection, retention, and access to records. Federal agencies must apply the Federal Records Act and NARA's guidance to manage both existing and new federal records, including the 2012 \"Managing Government Records Directive\" issued by NARA and OMB. The 2012 \"Managing Government Records Directive\" issued by the Obama Administration required executive branch agencies to manage email records electronically by 2016 and permanent electronic records by 2019. The directive also aimed to develop automated records management options with private industry. A 2015 GAO report found that 5 out of 24 agencies had not met the directive's requirements. NARA established the Capstone approach in 2013 to help agencies manage email records, suggesting automated capture of senior officials' email accounts as permanent records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) established the Capstone approach in 2013 to manage email records by automatically capturing senior officials' email accounts as permanent records. NARA also released guidance on unlawful record removal, social media record management, and email record management in 2013 and 2014. Additionally, NARA issued bulletins in previous presidential election years reminding agency heads of regulations on proper records management, including the removal of records by outgoing administrations. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) established the Capstone approach in 2013 to manage email records of senior officials. NARA also issued guidance on unlawful record removal, social media record management, and email record management. In February 2016, NARA re-issued guidance on \"Documenting Your Public Service\" to assist federal employees in managing federal records. The guidance emphasized the importance of employees being aware of their records management responsibilities, especially during Presidential transitions. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 changed the practice of Presidents taking official papers as personal property upon leaving office. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 changed the practice of Presidents taking official papers as personal property upon leaving office. The act established that all presidential records created after January 20, 1981, are government property transferred to the Archivist when a President leaves office. NARA works with various White House offices to coordinate the transfer of records and artifacts. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 shifted the practice of Presidents keeping official papers as personal property upon leaving office. It established that presidential records created after January 20, 1981, are government property transferred to the Archivist. White House offices work to coordinate the transfer of records and artifacts, preparing them for eventual transfer to NARA. The Act defines presidential records as materials created or received by the President or their immediate staff, including various forms of documentation. It also recognizes the President's historical privilege without limiting or expanding constitutional privileges. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 established that presidential records are government property transferred to the Archivist. The Act defines presidential records as materials created or received by the President or their immediate staff. The Act also recognizes the President's historical privilege regarding executive privilege. Successive presidential Administrations have interpreted the Act differently, with the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 providing a 60-day review period for the incumbent and former President before releasing presidential records. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 established that presidential records are government property transferred to the Archivist. The Act defines presidential records as materials created or received by the President or their immediate staff. The Act also recognizes the President's historical privilege regarding executive privilege. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 provide a 60-day review period for the incumbent and former President before releasing presidential records. This law also requires any claim of executive privilege to be made by the applicable former President or the incumbent President. Additionally, it prohibits anyone convicted of inappropriately using, removing, or destroying NARA records from accessing presidential records. NARA receives presidential records at the end of each Administration and has faced challenges managing the increasing volume and varied electronic formats of these records. The challenges of managing electronic records are highlighted by the huge volumes of electronic information, posing a significant technical challenge in agency record management. For example, the George W. Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data to the National Archives, which was 35 times more than the Clinton administration. NARA is responsible for the custody, control, and preservation of these records, including 70 million pages of textual records, 43,000 artifacts, 200 million emails, and 4 million digital photographs. NARA is responsible for the custody, control, and preservation of records of former Presidents, including 4 million digital photographs. Archivist David Ferriero highlighted the complexity of transferring electronic records during presidential transitions. Executive clemency, including presidential pardons and commutations, is granted by the President under Article II of the Constitution. Executive clemency, including presidential pardons, commutations, remissions, and reprieves, is a broad authority granted to the President under Article II of the Constitution. It can be used to reduce prison sentences, fines, or delay punishment, but only applies to violations of federal laws. The President has few restrictions on when and how clemency can be granted, and it can even be given before charges are filed. Additionally, group pardons have been historically rare but possible, as seen with President Abraham Lincoln's pardon for participants in the rebellion against the United States. Authority may face increased scrutiny during transitions as Presidents historically grant more clemency petitions in their final months. Controversial acts, like President G.H.W. Bush's pardon of Iran-Contra figures and President Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich, have been issued near the end of terms. Clemency acts can impede ongoing investigations, as seen with G.H.W. Bush pardoning officials involved in the Iran-Contra affair. President G.W. Bush's commutation of sentences for Border Patrol agents involved in a shooting incident sparked criticism from Mexico for prioritizing anti-immigrant groups over government efforts. There were also considerations for clemency for soldiers convicted of crimes at Abu Ghraib prison. U.S. cybersecurity has become a crucial aspect of national security. The importance of U.S. cybersecurity as a critical element of national security is highlighted in the 2015 National Security Strategy. The Director of National Intelligence assesses cyberspace-based threats in the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment. The presidential transition period may pose challenges for cybersecurity if key positions are not filled promptly. A coordinated federal agency architecture is essential for preparing for and responding to cybersecurity incidents, as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 41. President Obama released Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41) on July 26, 2016, establishing a unified architecture for coordinated cyber incident response among federal departments and agencies. The directive outlines incident response principles, including shared responsibility, risk assessment-based response, safeguarding of sensitive information, unified response, and facilitating recovery. It also designates federal agency lines of effort and lead agencies for each. The directive establishes federal agency lines of effort for cyber incident response. Threat Response involves law enforcement and national security investigations led by the Department of Justice. Asset Response provides technical assistance to victims led by the Department of Homeland Security. Intelligence Support involves intelligence collection and analysis led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The Department of Defense is not involved in these efforts. The National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, leads the federal effort for cybersecurity. The Department of Defense is identified as the lead for the Defense Industrial Base critical infrastructure sector. PPD-41 aims to clarify the government's response to cybersecurity incidents but does not specify agency responsibilities. The intelligence community provides briefings to presidential candidates on cybersecurity threats. The 2016 \"Threat Assessment\" report to Congress highlighted cybersecurity threats, including challenges from the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and targeting of personally identifiable information. Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and nonstate actors were identified as major threat actors. Concerns were raised about the cybersecurity qualifications of executive branch political appointees, with all agency heads having a responsibility for cybersecurity. Agency heads are responsible for providing information security protections in line with the risk of unauthorized access to information systems. They have cybersecurity responsibilities due to their managerial roles, regardless of other officials' responsibilities within federal agencies. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) also have explicit responsibilities for information technology security. Federal agencies have explicit responsibilities for information technology security, as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and FITARA. Vacancies in cybersecurity positions during a significant incident could have unknown implications. PPD-41 establishes coordination mechanisms like the Cyber Response Group and Cyber Unified Coordination Group to address vacancies and adjust responses. The presidential transition period poses unique security risks and opportunities. During the 2016-2017 election transition period, the security environment may pose increased risks for the United States. Collaboration between the outgoing and incoming Administrations is crucial for addressing foreign policy and security challenges. The change in leadership can impact national security policies and the international security environment. During the presidential transition period, a new leadership team may bring different strategies and policies, creating uncertainty and potential risks for U.S. security interests. Extremist groups and foreign powers may exploit this period to manipulate foreign and domestic policies. Attacks during this time could impact the transition and Administration's policies. During the presidential transition period, a new leadership team may bring different strategies and policies, creating uncertainty and potential risks for U.S. security interests. The transition period could affect the Administration's policies, with enhanced cooperation and communication between incoming and outgoing Administrations being crucial for national security and foreign policy concerns. It is important to start transition efforts at least six months before the election to avoid being behind on the day after the election. The presidential transition period comprises five phases, extending from campaign activities to inauguration. During the presidential transition period, the executive branch, incoming and outgoing Administrations, and Congress work together to ensure a smooth transfer of power. The newly elected President's response to challenges depends on effective planning and learning during the transition. Various activities are traditionally undertaken, such as consulting with experts, to facilitate a safe and thoughtful transition process. During presidential transitions, actions are taken to facilitate a smooth transfer of power, including consulting with experts, providing information to the President-elect, offering operational briefings on national security matters, preparing briefing books, and expediting security clearances. Agencies follow procedures when issuing rules, such as publishing notices in the Federal Register, taking comments, and publishing final rules. Regulations are important for policymaking in the federal government. During presidential transitions, actions are taken to facilitate a smooth transfer of power. Regulations in the Federal Register carry the force of law and are crucial for policymaking. \"Midnight rulemaking\" refers to the increased issuance of regulations by outgoing Administrations, raising concerns about political accountability and quality of regulations. During presidential transitions, \"midnight rulemaking\" can lead to rushed rules that may not receive proper review. Some argue that evaluating these rules can overwhelm a new Administration. However, a 2012 study found that many midnight regulations are routine matters or finishing tasks from before the transition period. Past Presidents have imposed moratoria on new regulations to control rulemaking at the start of their Administrations. During presidential transitions, moratoria have been imposed on new regulations to control rulemaking at the start of new Administrations. This includes postponing effective dates of rules issued at the end of the previous President's term and withdrawing proposed rules not published as final rules. Once final rules are published, a new Administration must go through the rulemaking process again to eliminate or change them. Past Presidents like Reagan, Clinton, and G.W. Bush have issued orders or memoranda to delay implementation of rules issued by their predecessors. During presidential transitions, moratoria have been imposed on new regulations to control rulemaking at the start of new Administrations. Recent outgoing Administrations have attempted to protect rules issued in their final months by establishing effective dates prior to the new Administration. For example, President G. W. Bush's Chief of Staff encouraged agencies to issue proposed and final rules by specific dates. President Obama's OIRA Administrator also took steps to ensure the continuity of rules during the transition period. President Obama's OIRA Administrator, Howard Shelanski, urged deputy secretaries to complete their highest priority rulemakings by the summer of 2016 to avoid a last-minute rush that could compromise the quality of regulations. Congress has the power to overturn or amend regulations issued by agencies, even after they have taken effect, by changing the underlying statutory authority. Congress has the authority to amend or provide additional instruction to agencies on regulations. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove agency rules, even those issued in previous sessions. Congress can also overturn agency rules through regular legislation or add provisions to appropriations bills to prohibit certain rules. The CRA requires all final rules to be submitted to Congress and the GAO before taking effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires final rules to be submitted to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before taking effect. Congress has 60 days to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval, and the Senate has 60 session days to act on it. If passed by both houses and signed by the President, the rule is nullified and cannot be reissued without statutory authorization. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to nullify final rules by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 days. If signed by the President, the rule is voided and cannot be reissued without new authorization. Over 71,000 rules have been submitted since 1996, with only one rule disapproved using the CRA - the ergonomics rule in March 2001 due to a transition in party control of the presidency. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to nullify final rules within 60 days. The overturning of the ergonomics rule in 2001 was due to a transition in party control of the presidency. Congress can also affect rulemaking through provisions in agency appropriations bills, such as restrictions on the use of funds for certain rulemaking-related purposes. Restrictions on the use of funds in appropriations bills can impact agency rulemaking, but unlike CRA resolutions, they do not nullify existing regulations. Regulated entities must still comply with rules, even if enforcement is limited. Additional limits may exist on influencing rulemaking through fund restrictions. Restrictions on the use of funds in appropriations acts are binding for a specific period and may apply to specific agencies or be government-wide. Some agencies are funded through sources other than congressional appropriations, allowing them more flexibility in using funds for rule development and enforcement. Federal regulations enforced by state or local governments may not be affected by fund restrictions. The President and the Senate share the power to fill top government positions, with the Constitution providing a framework for appointments. Outgoing Presidents have used recess appointments that extended into the next presidency, raising concerns for Congress. The appointment process for top government positions involves the President nominating individuals, the Senate considering the nomination, and if confirmed, the appointee being sworn in. The President can make temporary recess appointments if a position is vacant and the Senate is in recess, which expire at the end of the following Senate session. The Senate session lasts until adjournment sine die at the end of the following year, making recess appointments less likely due to scheduling practices. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that recess appointments can only be made during a recess of 10 days or longer, except in unusual circumstances. Appointees to executive branch positions usually serve at the pleasure of the President and can be removed at any time. Branch positions typically serve at the pleasure of the President, meaning they can be removed at any time. Congress can set specific terms or restrictions on the President's power to remove officials. Fixed terms and removal restrictions are more common for regulatory boards to establish independence from the President. An appointee to a position with a fixed term and protection from removal may serve through multiple presidencies without being removed by the incoming President unless specific grounds are met. Even appointees with fixed terms but no specified removal protection may still be shielded based on case law, with potential removal requiring political capital. Outgoing Presidents have historically made recess appointments in their final months, with recess appointees typically leaving with the appointing President. Recess appointees to positions with fixed terms and removal protection may serve until the term expires or the recess appointment ends. Outgoing Presidents could use recess appointments to fill positions beyond their term, potentially outlasting their time in office. Some appointees without explicit removal protection may still be difficult to remove. In some cases, outgoing Presidents may install controversial appointees who may not be confirmed by the new President or Senate. The likelihood of a departing President making a late-term recess appointment has decreased over the last decade, especially if the Senate is opposed. Arguments for and against this practice exist, with some supporting the President's constitutional authority until the end of their term, while others argue against making recess appointments to fixed term positions with removal protections. The Appointments Clause in the Constitution outlines the process for appointing federal judges, requiring the President to nominate and the Senate to provide advice and consent. This process, similar to executive branch appointments, has remained unchanged in its essential feature of power-sharing between the President and the Senate for over two centuries. The process of appointing federal judges involves the President nominating and the Senate confirming them. Vacancies in lower federal court judgeships are common at the beginning of a new presidency, while vacancies on the Supreme Court are rare. The Senate tends to approve fewer judicial nominations during an outgoing President's final year in office, leading to a higher number of vacant judgeships. Additionally, the Senate typically does not approve U.S. circuit court nominations during a presidential election year past June or July. Vacancies in lower federal court judgeships are common at the beginning of a new presidency. Before nominating a candidate, there is a thorough evaluation process by the White House Counsel's Office, Department of Justice, FBI, and American Bar Association. The selection process for federal court nominees involves background investigations by the FBI and evaluations by the American Bar Association. The President signs a nomination message for Senate consideration. The first circuit court nominations were submitted at different times during various presidencies, with district court nominations following a similar pattern. During presidential transitions, concerns about executive orders may arise due to the perception that outgoing Presidents may act unilaterally. Executive orders hold the force of law and allow Presidents to establish control over policymaking quickly and decisively. The ambiguity of statutes can further justify presidential action through executive orders. Executive orders allow Presidents to act quickly and decisively, seizing the initiative on issues and shaping the national agenda. They can be used to circumvent a hostile Congress or establish policy changes, especially for outgoing Presidents looking to secure their legacy. However, the use of executive orders, particularly by an outgoing President, may face criticism for lacking legitimacy. Some scholars criticize the use of unilateral directives like executive orders, noting their lack of legitimacy after a president has been repudiated at the polls. Despite their effectiveness for incoming Presidents to quickly enact policy changes, they may face challenges in amending their predecessor's actions without political consequences or legal obstacles. Table 2 compares the number of executive orders issued by different Presidents during various transition periods. Obama, G.W. Bush, Clinton, G.H.W. Bush, Reagan, and Carter issued comparable numbers of executive orders during the incoming period, with Trump signing the most. The pre-election period saw similar numbers of executive orders, while the lame duck period showed more variation. Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, G.W. Bush, and Obama issued fewer than 20 executive orders, while Clinton and Carter issued more. During transition periods, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, G.W. Bush, and Obama issued fewer than 20 executive orders each. Clinton and Carter issued more, with Carter's focused on the Iran hostage crisis. A study from April 1936 to December 1995 showed that the end of a President's term sees an increase in executive orders, especially if succeeded by a different party. This suggests a strong policy component in executive orders, with reelection also influencing the number issued. During transition periods, Presidents issue executive orders for various purposes, ranging from symbolic gestures to significant policy changes. The number of executive orders signed increases during reelection campaigns, showing a link between political motives and executive actions. President Carter's actions during transition included selecting an FBI director and closing the federal government. During transition periods, Presidents issue executive orders for various purposes, ranging from symbolic gestures to significant policy changes. President Carter established a committee to select an FBI director and closed the federal government. President Bush delegated disaster relief functions to the director of FEMA. President Reagan brought agency rulemaking under OMB control and required cost-benefit analyses for proposed rules. President Carter signed executive orders for the release of American hostages in Iran. Congress receives the President's budget submission in January for the upcoming fiscal year starting on October 1. The transition between presidential administrations raises special issues. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with the current requirement being on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year. The transition between presidential administrations raises questions about which President is required to submit the budget and how it will affect the timing and form of the submission. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 mandates the President to submit a budget annually to Congress between the first Monday in January and the first Monday in February. The 20th Amendment sets the beginning date for a President's term on January 20. Prior to 1990, outgoing Presidents were required to submit a budget, but a deadline change allowed them to pass this responsibility to their successor. President Obama submitted the FY2017 budget, and if he follows his predecessors, the FY2018 budget would be submitted by his successor. During presidential transitions, outgoing Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan submitted budgets on time, while George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush left budget submissions to their successors. Congress has extended budget submission deadlines in the past. Several original budgets were submitted late without authorization, including FY1991 and FY1989. Transition-year budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 were also submitted late. Presidents Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama all had delays in submitting their budgets. President Obama submitted his detailed budget proposal in May 2009, following a tradition of advising Congress on economic and budgetary policies in February. Incoming Presidents can revise the budget at any time, with most assuming office with their predecessor's budget in place. Since FY1977, six incoming Presidents chose to modify their predecessor's budget by submitting revisions shortly after taking office, including Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan. On the other hand, six incoming Presidents, such as Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, and G.H.W. Bush, chose not to submit revisions. President George H.W. Bush did not officially revise President Reagan's FY1990 budget but submitted a document to Congress with similar elements as previous incoming Presidents' budget revisions."
