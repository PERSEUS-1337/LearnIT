    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of a well-informed citizenry in a democratic society and emphasizes the need for access to Government information for accountability. It highlights the public's right to timely, complete, and affordable access to Government information, emphasizing the use of modern technology for citizen benefit. Government information is considered a national resource and economic asset belonging to the public, funded by taxpayers who should not be burdened with excessive fees. Difficulty in providing feedback on Federal information policies is noted as a barrier to citizen engagement. Federal agencies are criticized for not considering public interest in managing information resources, being slow in developing standards for information access, and not providing timely access to government information products and services at reasonable costs. The new chapter \"INFORMATION DISSEMINATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES\" is added to Title 44, United States Code, to improve public access to government information. The new chapter \"INFORMATION DISSEMINATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES\" in Title 44, United States Code requires executive departments and establishments to prepare and share reports on their information dissemination policies, efforts to introduce new products/services, develop standards for information access, and create comprehensive indexes and bibliographies. The new chapter in Title 44, United States Code mandates executive departments and establishments to publish reports on their information dissemination policies, including creating comprehensive indexes, protecting access to outdated records, and making the public aware of information resources. Each year by February 1, these entities must notify users of the availability of the report in the Federal Register and other appropriate channels. The new chapter in Title 44, United States Code requires departments and establishments to notify the public of the availability of reports on their information dissemination policies. Users are given 90 days to submit comments on the types of information collected, storage methods, pricing, and information quality. Comments received will be made available for public inspection. Each year, agencies must provide opportunities for public dialogue on information dissemination policies. Before discontinuing a service, agencies must publish a notice for public comments and consider feedback. Agencies are required to disseminate information through various channels to meet statutory requirements. Each agency must disseminate information through diverse modes and outlets to meet statutory requirements and ensure public access. Information must be timely, useful, and reliable, stored in standardized formats, and distributed through free or low-cost channels. Agencies are prohibited from charging depository libraries for distribution costs, except as authorized by statute. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology issue model performance standards for agencies to provide public access to records. Agencies are encouraged to provide copies of public documents upon request within a specified timeframe, without charging for distribution costs. Upon request, agencies must provide copies of public documents by mail within a specified timeframe. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for providing access to agency records within a year of the enactment of the Act."
