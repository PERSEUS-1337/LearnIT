    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease approximately 240 acres of wetland habitat and have entered into a contract to purchase more land for habitat protection and management. Additionally, they have identified 800 acres of wildlife habitat adjacent to the Refuge owned by the estate of James Campbell. The land owned by the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku Coast features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support diverse wildlife, including endangered Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide more opportunities for wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of this land will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land. Acquisition of the land owned by the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku Coast is necessary to create a single, large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts on the Refuge and to mitigate flood damage in the town of Kahuku.
