    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. The Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security forced employees out based on their sexual orientation, citing security risks. Many patriotic Americans were also barred from joining the Department due to discriminatory screening processes. Congress played a role in these actions, stemming from investigations into federal employees' \"sex perversion\". Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State had to report annually on the number of homosexuals fired, as part of their appeals before Committees on Appropriations. In the early 1990s, the Department's security office investigated and removed gay personnel as \"security risks\". Secretary of State Warren Christopher prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1994, and President Clinton signed a similar order in 1998. In 1998, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13087 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Department of State. In 2017, Secretary of State John Kerry apologized for past discriminatory practices and reaffirmed the commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community. The Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources, in consultation with the Historian of the Department of State, will review employee terminations since January 1, 1950, to identify wrongful terminations based on sexual orientation. A report compiling this information will be made public within 270 days. Additionally, there will be reports on the reviews conducted. The Secretary of State will review the consistency of reviews conducted by the Director General under section 3 and submit reports to Congress within 270 days of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a Reconciliation Board will be established. The Secretary of State will establish an independent Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights to review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings. The Board will contact affected employees or their families, offer to change employment records, and provide a point of contact for testimonies of discrimination. The Reconciliation Board will review reports of discrimination and termination based on sexual orientation. Employees can provide testimony to document discriminatory policies. The Board will review claims within 150 days and the Department of State will provide necessary information. The Board will terminate 5 years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY. Secretary of State Kerry apologized on January 9, 2017 for past discrimination against LGBTI employees at the State Department, acknowledging the wrongs done in the past and expressing support for the LGBTI community. Congress hereby offers a formal apology for its responsibility in encouraging the \"Lavender Scare\" and similar policies at the Department of State, as these policies were in part a response to congressional investigations into \"sex perversion of Federal employees\", reports on the employment of \"moral perverts by Government Agencies\", and hearings or pressure otherwise placed on the Department of State through the appropriations process. The Secretary of State will establish a permanent exhibit on the \"Lavender Scare\" at the United States Diplomacy Center museum to ensure the history of this episode is remembered. The exhibit must be installed within a year, provide access to relevant reports, and display material from oral testimonies. SEC. 8. GUIDANCE ON ISSUING VISAS.\n\nThe Secretary of State must report to Congress within 100 days on countries denying visas to spouses of Foreign Service personnel based on sexual orientation. Recommendations may include ending visa reciprocity with offending countries to ensure all spouses receive visas regardless of sexual orientation. The Secretary of State will establish an Advancement Board within the Department of State to address issues faced by LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families. The Board will hear testimony on discrimination faced due to sexual orientation and submit reports to Congress with recommendations for improvement. The reports will remain private and accessible only to Members of Congress. The report on discrimination faced by LGBTQI Foreign Service employees will be private and accessible only to Members of Congress and the Advancement Board."
