    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Voluntary Alcohol Advertising Standards for Children Act\". The Congress finds that television advertising influences children's perception of societal values and behavior, especially regarding alcoholic beverages. Children are exposed to a significant amount of television each week, with alcohol producers spending a substantial amount on advertising in broadcast media, targeting underage individuals with themes like humor and athletic pursuits. The current advertising codes of brewers and distillers are inadequate to restrain most of the ads that reach young people and encourage them to drink. These codes are unenforceable, lack uniformity, and do not shield underage audiences from alcohol promotions. Alcohol producers argue that voluntary broadcast industry standards can protect children from alcohol promotions, avoiding government restrictions and allowing them to promote to adults. These standards are seen as minimally restrictive and align with their business missions and social responsibility. SEC. 337 of the Communications Act of 1934 establishes and implements television advertising codes. The Commission shall prescribe a code of conduct for alcoholic beverage advertisements in video programming to limit exposure to minors, based on recommendations from an advisory committee. The committee must be balanced and provided with necessary resources. The committee appointed by the Commission must submit a final report of its recommendations within one year. An antitrust exemption allows joint discussions in the television industry to develop a voluntary code limiting minors' exposure to alcohol ads in video programming. This exemption does not apply to boycotts and is limited to specific actions. The antitrust exemption allows joint discussions in the television industry to develop a voluntary code limiting minors' exposure to alcohol ads in video programming. This exemption does not apply to boycotts and is limited to specific actions within a 1-year period after enactment. Enforcement of advertising codes established under this section is considered a regulation by the Commission. The requirement for the Commission to prescribe a code takes effect after 1 year if no voluntary code is implemented by the industry. The Commission will assess the implementation of a code limiting minors' exposure to alcohol ads in video programming in its annual report. Definitions for antitrust laws are provided, including the inclusion of unfair competition practices under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The term 'person in the television industry' includes various entities involved in producing or broadcasting programming. The term 'video programming' is defined in section 602 of the Act."
