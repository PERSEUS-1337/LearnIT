    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act\" and involves the temporary reinstatement of airport and airway trust fund taxes. The Fuel Tax rates specified in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are amended to be 4.3 cents per gallon for aviation gasoline after specific dates mentioned in the enactment of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act amended various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to fuel tax rates and ticket taxes, specifying specific periods for the application of taxes. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act amended tax rates for aviation fuel and ticket taxes within specific timeframes. Floor Stocks Taxes on Aviation Fuel are imposed at a rate of 17.5 cents per gallon on aviation fuel held by any person before a tax-increase date. The liability for the tax falls on the person holding the fuel, and payment must be made as prescribed by the Secretary within the specified timeframe. The tax-increase date is defined as 7 calendar days after the enactment of the Act. Aviation fuel is defined as per section 4093 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax imposed on aviation fuel before the tax-increase date does not apply if held exclusively for certain uses. On the tax-increase date, no tax is imposed on aviation fuel held by a person if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons. Fuel exempt from tax by certain reasons is not taken into account. Controlled groups are considered for this exemption. On the tax-increase date, aviation fuel held by a person is exempt from tax if the amount is under 2,000 gallons. Controlled groups are treated as one group for tax exemption purposes. The term \"controlled group\" is defined as per section 1563 of the Code, with \"more than 50 percent\" replacing \"at least 80 percent\" in the definition. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those for controlled groups apply to nonincorporated persons under common control. All provisions of law applicable to taxes imposed by section 4091 of the Code also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by paragraph (1). The amendments made by this section take effect 7 days after enactment, with transportation using tickets purchased during the lapse period subject to taxes imposed by sections 4261 and 4271. Transportation using tickets purchased during lapse period is exempt from taxes imposed by sections 4261 and 4271 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment to Section 9502(b) of the Code states that any tax amount received in the Treasury after specific dates shall be treated as received the day before such date, regardless of when it was actually received. This amendment applies to amounts received after December 31, 1995."
