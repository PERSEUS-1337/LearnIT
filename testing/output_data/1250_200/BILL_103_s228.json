    "content": "The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 highlights the importance of bicycle helmet use due to the high number of head injuries and deaths among cyclists, especially children. The Act emphasizes the need for a program to promote universal helmet use to prevent injuries and save lives. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 emphasizes the importance of promoting bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16 through grants for programs that enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, and educate on safety. The Administrator allows grantees to design effective programs to increase helmet use. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 requires bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after enactment to conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, with the Consumer Product Safety Commission establishing a final standard within 60 days. The final standard for bicycle helmets must protect against helmets coming off, address injury risks to children, and include additional provisions. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply, and the final standard takes effect 1 year after issuance. Failure to meet interim standards results in violation of safety standards until the final standard is in place. The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed under subsection (c), will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final standards."
