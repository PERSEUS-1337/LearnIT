    "title": "AB 2687",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 23152 of the Vehicle Code in California prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher. The law also applies to individuals addicted to drugs, except those in approved treatment programs. It is illegal to drive a commercial motor vehicle with 0.04 percent or more of alcohol in the blood. If a chemical test within three hours after driving shows 0.04 percent or more alcohol, it is presumed the person had that amount at the time of driving. Starting July 1, 2018, it is illegal to drive a vehicle with 0.04 percent or more alcohol in the blood when a passenger for hire is present. It is also unlawful to drive under the influence of any drug or a combination of alcohol and drugs. It is illegal to drive under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs, with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more causing bodily injury to others. In a prosecution for driving a commercial motor vehicle with 0.04 percent or more alcohol in the blood, it is not necessary to prove a specific code violation. If a person with 0.04 percent or more alcohol in their blood causes bodily injury while neglecting any duty imposed by law in driving the vehicle, it is unlawful. A rebuttable presumption exists if the person had 0.04 percent or more alcohol in their blood within three hours after driving. Starting July 1, 2018, it is illegal to drive a motor vehicle with 0.04 percent or more alcohol in the blood if a passenger for hire is in the vehicle and the driver's actions cause bodily injury to someone else. A passenger for hire is someone who pays or is expected to pay for the ride. If a chemical test within three hours after driving shows 0.04 percent or more alcohol in the blood, it is presumed that the driver had the same level of alcohol while driving. It is unlawful to drive under the influence of drugs or a combination of alcohol and drugs, leading to bodily injury to others. No reimbursement is required for implementing this law."
