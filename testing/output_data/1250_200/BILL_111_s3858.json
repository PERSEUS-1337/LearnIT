    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing for initial admission of 3 years with the possibility of extension. Employers hiring H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing that the positions are seasonal or temporary. Workers in dairy, sheepherding, or goat herding positions do not need to prove the job is seasonal. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status in these roles for at least 33 of the last 36 months can apply for immigrant visas. Classification petitions can be filed by the employer or the alien themselves. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status can apply for immigrant visas without needing a labor certification. Filing a petition or adjustment of status based on the petition will not affect other H-2A worker-related requests. The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend the stay of eligible aliens with pending or approved petitions for H-2A worker status in 1-year increments until a final decision is made on their adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This provision does not prevent eligible aliens from seeking adjustment of status through other means.

Additionally, the term in subsection (j)(1) is modified to include an exception under subsection (h)(2)(A)."
