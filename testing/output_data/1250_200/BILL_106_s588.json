The Act, titled \"Social Security for the 21st Century Act,\" defines key terms related to Retirement Security Accounts, including Commissioner, electing individual, eligible individual, retirement security account, and retirement security account contribution. The Investment Board, established under section 255(b), defines the term 'retirement security account contribution' as per section 252(e)(2)(A). The curr_chunk is about the election and establishment of retirement security accounts. An eligible individual can elect to make retirement security account contributions, which are irrevocable and effective for future earnings. The election can be made on W-4 forms or as prescribed by the Commissioner. Within 30 days of receiving the first contribution, a retirement security account is established for the individual. The account holder's social security number identifies the account. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers contributions from the Trust Fund to a retirement security account. The contribution is based on a percentage of wages or self-employment income. During an election period, the applicable percentage for each quarter of coverage is determined based on the amounts collected under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The percentage increases for successive quarters but is capped at a certain limit. Electing individuals must designate one or more investment options for their retirement security account. Each electing individual must designate one or more investment options for their retirement security account. The designation should be made as prescribed by the Commissioner to ensure ease of administration. If no designation is made, the Commissioner will make the designation according to regulations. Treatment of retirement security accounts: Any retirement security account will be treated similarly to an individual account in the Thrift Savings Fund. Distributions from retirement security accounts are subject to specific regulations. Sec. 254 outlines the rules for distributions from a retirement security account, specifying that distributions can only be made once the individual starts receiving benefits under the title. The distribution must be in the form of annuities or equal monthly payments, with at least 75 percent of the account balance paid out. Regulations will determine the specifics of these payments. The regulations for distributions from a retirement security account include requirements similar to those for payments under title 5, with excess funds payable to the individual. In the event of death before distribution, the balance is paid to heirs in a lump sum. All distributions are tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The retirement security fund allows for tax-exempt distributions to individuals or their heirs in the event of death before distribution. The Retirement Security Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, similar to the Thrift Savings Fund. A Retirement Security Fund Investment Board is created to manage and report on the activities of the Fund, similar to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board manages and reports on the Thrift Savings Fund and individual accounts under subchapter VII of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code. It conducts a study on increasing investment options for retirement security accounts and submits a detailed report to the President and Congress within 2 years of the Social Security for the 21st Century Act enactment. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board conducts a study on increasing investment options for retirement security accounts and submits a detailed report with legislative recommendations to the President and Congress. The Retirement Security Fund and accounts are exempt from the US Government budget totals and limitations. Amendments apply to elections after December 31, 2000. Social Security benefits may be reduced upon election under Part B. The primary insurance amount for an electing individual under Part B is reduced by 50 percent, effective after December 31, 2000. This reduction does not affect benefits dependent on the electing individual's wages and self-employment income. SEC. 3. Amends the Social Security Act to include an estimate of retirement security account contributions and balances in the benefit statement. SEC. 4. Establishes a special reserve account. A special reserve account called the 'Protect Social Security Account' is established within the Treasury to save budget surpluses until a reform measure ensures the long-term solvency of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will deposit an amount equal to 70 percent of the projected surplus into the account annually from 1999 to 2010. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will project the budget surplus for the total budget of the United States Government from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2010. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest funds in a special account until a reform measure is enacted. The amendment applies to fiscal years starting on or after October 1, 1999."
