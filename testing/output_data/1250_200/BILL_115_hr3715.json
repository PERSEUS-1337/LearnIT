    "content": "The Act titled \"Scenic Columbia Gorge Restoration Act of 2017\" allows for expedited recovery activities in response to catastrophic events in national scenic areas. The Act defines terms related to catastrophic events, response activities, and National Scenic Areas. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the Forest Service, must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. Public input and a response process must be allowed, with specific timelines for scoping, objections, and agency responses. After completion of this process, the Secretary will implement the response activity, following an expedited environmental assessment. The Secretary must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. An expedited environmental assessment for a response activity should be completed within 60 days after the event. A categorical exclusion is available for response activities not exceeding 10,000 acres within the area. Consultation under the Endangered Species Act is not required if a response activity is not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat. For response activities not covered by this exemption, consultation must be completed within 90 days of the Secretary's request. Within 90 days of the Secretary's consultation request, if no conclusion is reached, the response activity is deemed not to violate the Endangered Species Act and can proceed. Courts cannot issue restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, or injunctions pending appeal for response activities. Section 705 of title 5, United States Code, does not apply to challenges of response activities. Funding comes from a special fund. The Secretary can proceed with response activities if no conclusion is reached within 90 days of consultation request. Challenges to response activities are exempt from Section 705 of title 5, United States Code. Funding for response activities comes from a special fund. Reforestation of at least 75 percent of impacted lands must be achieved within two years following a catastrophic event on National Scenic Area lands."
