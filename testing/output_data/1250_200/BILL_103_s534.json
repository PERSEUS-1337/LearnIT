    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75% of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers against various unavoidable causes of loss, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more. Insurance coverage shall not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. Insurance coverage for agricultural producers does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. Standard yield coverage provides protection against yield loss up to 75% of the average yield on the insured farm. Adjustments may be made to ensure fairness among farms in the same area. Additionally, lesser yield coverage is available through the Corporation. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including coverage at 50 percent of the average yield. Insurance may be provided based on adjusted yields established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. The Corporation offers additional insurance coverage for increased risk at a premium set by the Board. Coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of the average yield may be available if normal yield variations have not resulted in loss claims. The Corporation limits coverage to 75 percent of the average yield and offers a price option based on projected market prices. Insurance does not cover losses due to neglect, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on risk. Insurance may not be provided for agricultural commodities in counties where income is insignificant. The Corporation must report annual results to Congress. Starting in 1992, a price level for each insured commodity will be established. The Corporation will establish a price level for each commodity offered insurance, not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available based on the price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day of delay. Late planting coverage is automatically included in a basic insurance policy for producers on a farm, unless they choose to waive it. If late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or natural disaster, providing 50% of the guaranteed level of coverage for the crop. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop, with its value offsetting the remaining coverage for the insured crop. The substitute crop's value offsets the remaining guaranteed coverage for the insured crop. Producers have prevented planting coverage unless they opt out, and if this coverage would increase premiums significantly, it will be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of production is less than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will establish a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters, allowing the use of transitional or actual yields. Producers can elect to use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will make adjustments in the Nonstandard Classification procedures for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to accommodate producer yield declines from natural disasters, defining transitional yield as the countywide average used when no actual production records are available."
