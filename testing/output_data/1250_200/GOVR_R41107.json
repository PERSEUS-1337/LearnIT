    "content": "Negotiating parties of the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. The ACTA would enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification is deposited. Mexico signed the ACTA on July 11, 2012, requiring ratification in the Mexican Congress. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, leading to suspensions in several EU member states. On February 22, 2012, the European Commission paused the ACTA ratification process and sent it to the European Court of Justice for review. The European Union and 22 member states signed the ACTA on January 25, 2012. In October 2011, several countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the United States signed the agreement. The final version of the ACTA text was released in May 2011 after nearly three years of negotiations. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was publicly released in its final version in October 2010 after nearly three years of negotiations. It is a new agreement aimed at combating intellectual property rights infringement, focusing on trademarks and copyrights enforcement. The ACTA was negotiated by several countries including the United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea, and others to address emerging IPR issues not adequately covered in the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, including provisions on civil enforcement, border measures, and criminal enforcement for trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy. Negotiations concluded in October 2010, with countries having until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. All negotiating parties, except Mexico and Switzerland, have signed the agreement, with domestic ratification procedures to follow. The idea of negotiating the ACTA was conceived in 2006 by the United States and Japan to combat counterfeiting and piracy. In 2006, the United States and Japan proposed the ACTA to combat counterfeiting and piracy. Negotiations involving various countries began in 2007 and concluded in October 2010. The final round was held in Japan in October 2010, where a largely finalized text of the agreement was produced. The agreement was to be submitted to respective authorities for approval. On October 1, 2011, several countries signed the ACTA agreement, with additional countries expressing support and preparation to sign. The European Union and 22 member states signed in January 2012, followed by Mexico in July 2012. The agreement will enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification is deposited. Countries are now going through their domestic approval processes. The ACTA agreement is being submitted for domestic approval processes by negotiating parties. The U.S. negotiated it as an executive agreement, not requiring congressional approval unless statutory changes are needed. The EU and its member states must sign and ratify the ACTA for it to enter into force, but the European Parliament voted against it in July 2012. EU member states are undergoing national ratification processes amidst protests for Internet free speech. Several EU member states have suspended or not initiated domestic adoption of the ACTA, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia. The European Commission has placed the ACTA ratification process on hold and submitted it to the European Court of Justice for compatibility with EU law. There is a possibility of the European Commission reviving the ACTA after the court ruling. Implementation of the ACTA may require some countries to pass new laws, including granting customs officials authority to initiate criminal investigations and providing legal remedies for circumventing technological protection measures. The ACTA involves criminal investigations for trademark infringement and copyright piracy, as well as legal remedies for circumventing TPM. Canada incorporated WIPO Internet treaties into domestic law with copyright bill C-11. Countries in ACTA negotiations are economically advanced and value IPR-based industries. These countries are part of major international trade liberalization efforts and have acceded to the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, international cooperation, and enhanced enforcement measures. It discusses the nature and scope of the agreement, its relationship to existing agreements, provisions on privacy and disclosure of information, and definitions of terms used in the agreement. It allows flexibility for each Party to implement more extensive IPR enforcement than required and to determine the appropriate method of implementation within its legal system. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, including general obligations for enforcement, civil enforcement, border measures, criminal enforcement, and enforcement in the digital environment. It requires effective enforcement action that provides expeditious remedies, avoids trade barriers, and ensures fair treatment. The civil enforcement section emphasizes proportionality in infringement seriousness and applicable measures. The civil enforcement section of the ACTA emphasizes the seriousness of infringement, third-party rights, and applicable measures. It requires parties to provide judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, including issuing injunctions, calculating damages, recovering costs, and ordering the destruction of infringing goods. Provisional measures like seizures can also be ordered to prevent infringement. The civil enforcement section of the ACTA emphasizes the seriousness of infringement and applicable measures, including judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, injunctions, damages, and destruction of infringing goods. Border measures aim to enforce IPR without discrimination, allowing customs authorities to suspend the release of suspect goods and detain them upon request from right holders. The ACTA emphasizes the seriousness of infringement and applicable measures for IPR enforcement, including judicial procedures, injunctions, damages, and destruction of infringing goods. Each Party must provide for criminal procedures and penalties for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including imprisonment and monetary fines as deterrents. Authorities are authorized to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit goods and related materials. The ACTA emphasizes the seriousness of infringement and applicable measures for IPR enforcement, including judicial procedures, injunctions, damages, and destruction of infringing goods. Each Party must provide for criminal procedures and penalties for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including imprisonment and monetary fines as deterrents. Authorities are authorized to order the seizure, forfeiture, and destruction of counterfeit goods, related materials, and assets derived from infringing activities. The digital enforcement section addresses obligations for enforcing copyrights and related rights over digital networks, ensuring effective enforcement action against IPR. The enforcement procedures in the agreement focus on effective action against IPR infringement in the digital environment, including copyright infringement over digital networks. Parties must avoid creating barriers to legitimate activity and uphold principles of freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy. Authorities may order online service providers to disclose identifying information related to alleged infringement. Legal protection and remedies against circumvention of technological measures and protection of electronic rights management information are required. Limitations and exceptions may be adopted in implementing these remedies. The enforcement practices chapter focuses on methods used by Parties to apply IPR enforcement laws, promoting expertise within competent authorities, collecting statistical data on IPR infringement, consulting with stakeholders, managing infringement risks at the border, promoting transparency, and public awareness of IPR importance. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of transparency in IPR enforcement, promoting public awareness of IPR, considering environmental factors in destroying infringing goods, and international cooperation among Parties to address challenges in cross-border trade of counterfeit products. It also establishes an ACTA Committee to review the implementation and operation of the agreement. The institutional arrangement chapter establishes an ACTA Committee to review the implementation and operation of the agreement, proposed amendments, and terms of accession. The agreement remains open for signature until May 1, 2013, and enters into force after the sixth instrument of ratification. The United States conducted the ACTA negotiation through the USTR, which leads U.S. trade agreements. The USTR leads U.S. trade agreement negotiations and crafts policy through an interagency process. The ACTA was negotiated as an executive agreement, consistent with existing U.S. laws, and does not require congressional approval or changes to U.S. law for implementation. The United States may implement the ACTA under existing legal authority without the need for congressional approval. Congress has oversight during the negotiation process but does not have a consultative role in the ACTA. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce and intellectual property rights. The United States has concerns about global IPR infringement, which can be costly for U.S. firms and consumers. IPR goals have been pursued in international trade agreements, but the ACTA negotiations were conducted through an executive agreement. This departure from past practices may pose risks, as piracy is facilitated by easily duplicable technologies like digital media and the internet. The increase in piracy, fueled by easily duplicable products like digital media, is a concern for the U.S. Growing Internet usage has also contributed to the distribution of counterfeit goods. Inadequate penalties in some countries do not deter counterfeiting and piracy. Protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) is crucial for the U.S. economy and to prevent negative consequences. The U.S. participates in ACTA negotiations to address economic, health, safety, and security issues related to counterfeiting and piracy. Adequate IPR protection is seen as vital for promoting innovation and competitiveness in various industries. Advocates of a strong international IPR regime claim that counterfeiting and piracy cause significant revenue and trade losses for legitimate industries. Tracking production and trade in counterfeit goods is challenging due to the secretive nature of IPR infringement. Digital media infringement is even harder to monitor as it is disseminated online. Some companies are hesitant to disclose IPR infringement issues for fear of affecting their product marketing. Some question the commercial rationale for the ACTA, pointing out that estimates for losses from IPR infringement may be biased. Critics argue that IPR protection favors private rights over broader economic and social welfare. Advocates of civil liberties highlight the importance of evaluating exceptions like \"fair use\" in copyright law. Critics argue that IPR protection may favor private rights over broader economic and social welfare. U.S. participation in the ACTA negotiation is also driven by health and safety concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy, with advocates highlighting the risks posed by counterfeit products. There is a debate on the conflation of counterfeiting with health threats, as legitimate medicines can still pose safety risks if substandard. Increasing IPR protection may incentivize innovation but could also present challenges for public health. Some express concern that increasing IPR protection and enforcement may pose challenges for public health, such as access to affordable medicines. The U.S. involvement in the ACTA also centers on security concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy, which may be linked to organized crime syndicates. The United States pursues IPR objectives through various trade policy mechanisms. The ACTA aims to enhance IPR protection beyond the TRIPS Agreement, addressing issues with new technologies and digital piracy. The TRIPS Agreement seeks to balance private rights with public development goals, but ongoing debates question its fairness and legitimacy. The United States pursues international IPR protection through regional and bilateral FTAs, seeking levels of protection that exceed the TRIPS Agreement. The pursuit of \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions has sparked debates about the balance of rights and obligations. Some IPR provisions in U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia were revised after the Bipartisan Trade Agreement in 2007. U.S. FTAs have influenced the ACTA, with the U.S. aiming to model it on provisions from agreements with Australia, Morocco, Singapore, and South Korea. These agreements include provisions on criminal penalties for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The ACTA is a plurilateral agreement focused on intellectual property rights, modeled after U.S. FTAs with Australia, Morocco, Singapore, and South Korea. It includes provisions on criminal penalties for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The negotiation process has sparked debates on transparency and inclusiveness among stakeholders. The ACTA is a plurilateral agreement focused on intellectual property rights, with stakeholders voicing concerns about scope, transparency, and inclusiveness. U.S. business groups support the ACTA for stronger IPR protection, while others, like Internet service providers, have concerns about digital enforcement provisions. Civil society groups worry about trade implications, consumer privacy, and free flow of information. Some question the need for a new agreement to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The ACTA initially focused on combating counterfeit goods but expanded to include piracy as well. Negotiating parties differed on the inclusion of patents in civil enforcement. The agreement raised concerns about scope, transparency, and inclusiveness among stakeholders. The EU advocated for including patents in civil enforcement in the ACTA, while the US opposed it. The final text allows parties to exclude patents from civil enforcement. Countries like the US plan to exclude patents. The EU and US also disagreed on including trademarks in the digital enforcement section. The EU supported including trademarks in the digital enforcement section of the ACTA, expressing concern about Internet sales of goods infringing on European trademarks. The US opposed this inclusion, citing concerns about contradicting U.S. law. The final ACTA text primarily focuses on copyright infringement over digital networks but includes a provision for disclosing information to identify subscribers involved in trademark or copyright infringement. The ACTA negotiation process has raised concerns about transparency and public input. Critics argue that there was limited consultation with consumer and public interest groups, with a focus on right holders from industries like entertainment and pharmaceuticals. The level of secrecy in the negotiations was unprecedented compared to other trade agreements like the WTO TRIPS Agreement. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have called for increased transparency in the ACTA negotiations. The ACTA negotiation process faced criticism for lack of transparency and limited public input. USTR initially withheld draft text citing security reasons but later shared it with cleared advisors and selected groups under non-disclosure agreements. The process gradually became more transparent as negotiations progressed. The ACTA negotiation process became more transparent as it advanced, with USTR releasing key elements, draft texts, and finalized versions. USTR also highlighted steps taken in 2009 to increase transparency, including establishing a dedicated web page and consulting with Congress and stakeholders. The USTR consulted with Congress, industry, and stakeholders on ACTA developments. They sought advice from various experts and held public meetings to discuss the agreement. Controversy arose over the lack of developing country participation in the negotiations. The ACTA was negotiated among advanced industrialized countries, raising concerns from developing countries about potential negative impacts on trade, public health, and IPR flexibility. Some questioned the inclusion of countries with inadequate IPR protection in the agreement. The USTR's Special 301 report questioned the involvement of countries with inadequate IPR protection in the ACTA. Some observers also questioned the effectiveness of the agreement without major sources of counterfeiting like China and Russia. The ACTA may expand to include other countries after the signatory period, with the ACTA Committee deciding on accession terms. USTR hopes for more countries to join. The ACTA Committee decides on terms of accession for new members, with USTR hoping for more countries to join. Critics fear developing countries may join after the agreement is finalized, potentially pressuring them to adhere for trade benefits. Debate surrounds the impact of increased IPR protection on trade and consumer activities, with IPR industries supporting ACTA for economic growth while consumer rights groups express concerns. Enhanced standards in the ACTA aim to boost economic growth and employment. Some stakeholders raise concerns about potential interference with trade in legitimate goods and consumer activity. Negotiating parties assure that the ACTA upholds fundamental rights, civil liberties, and trade agreements. Key points include the respect for public health declarations, protection of generic medicines, and no obligation for border searches of travelers' belongings for infringing materials. The ACTA does not require border authorities to search travelers' baggage or electronic devices for infringing materials. Critics are concerned about the impact on consumer privacy and free flow of information, particularly regarding provisions that could lead to ISPs terminating customers' Internet accounts for alleged copyright infringement. Some argue that increasing ISP involvement in enforcement is necessary to combat online piracy, while others believe it places undue burdens on ISPs and infringes on civil liberties. The debate surrounding ISP obligations related to IPR infringement has been heightened by legislation like the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA. Concerns have been raised about maintaining U.S. \"fair use\" practices under an agreement like ACTA, as well as potential provisions on remedies against circumvention of TPM. The final ACTA text does not include a low threshold for terminating consumers' Internet access based on allegations of online piracy. The final ACTA text includes provisions for ISPs to disclose subscriber information for infringement cases, but does not include \"three-strikes\" or \"notice-and-takedown\" rules. It also addresses concerns about TPM enforcement, emphasizing the importance of avoiding barriers to legitimate activities. Border enforcement provisions allow customs officials to seize goods suspected of infringing IPR, raising concerns about trade in legitimate goods. Enforcement provisions in the ACTA allow customs officials to seize goods suspected of infringing IPR, with some countries not empowering their officials with ex-officio authority. In the US, CBP can seize goods violating copyrights and trademarks but not patents. Granting customs officials ex-officio authority is seen as crucial by business groups to combat counterfeit goods, while critics argue it may infringe on civil liberties. The ACTA negotiation included discussions on border enforcement measures for copyright piracy, with concerns raised about potential delays in trade and impacts on public health due to the inclusion of patents. Critics worry about the interference with legitimate trade in generic medicines and the potential for customs authorities to hinder the movement of goods. The final text of the ACTA includes a footnote addressing these concerns regarding patents. The ACTA negotiation focused on border enforcement measures for copyright piracy, excluding patents and undisclosed information. Concerns remain about the impact on access to generic medicines. The ACTA was negotiated separately from existing multilateral frameworks, allowing for more efficient global IPR protection advancement. Advancement of trade negotiations in multilateral venues has stalled, with the WTO Doha Round and WIPO global patent agenda at a standstill. ACTA negotiations are seen as innovative but criticized for bypassing existing multilateral frameworks. Concerns arise about the long-term status of ACTA as a stand-alone agreement. Some question the future status of the ACTA as a standalone agreement, with hopes that the WTO may incorporate its standards. Supporters argue that the ACTA enhances IPR protection and enforcement beyond existing frameworks, particularly in addressing digital infringement concerns. Critics question the necessity of the ACTA, suggesting it may overlap with existing international agreements like the WIPO Internet treaties and the WTO TRIPS Agreement. They also doubt the effectiveness of pursuing new trade agreements when some countries have not fully complied with current IPR frameworks. Some critics question the necessity of the ACTA, doubting its effectiveness in addressing issues already covered by existing international agreements. They also raise concerns about the enforcement of IPR laws and the potential impact of the ACTA on global intellectual property protection. The 112th Congress may consider its role in the ACTA approval process beyond oversight. The 112th Congress may examine the role of Congress in the ACTA approval process, including potential constitutional issues. Questions for Congress include the impact of ACTA on congressional action, prioritization of IPR infringements, and the rationale for ACTA including commercial losses and health concerns. The proposed ACTA raises questions about prioritizing IPR infringements, implications for federal funds allocation, future U.S. trade policy, and potential conflicts with Congress's trade objectives. Additionally, it raises concerns about the ACTA's impact on future FTAs, USTR determinations, and the prospects of entering into force following the European Parliament's rejection."
