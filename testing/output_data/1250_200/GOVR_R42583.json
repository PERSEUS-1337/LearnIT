    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs aim to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and services for unemployed individuals, including youth, through programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These programs are part of the federal job training system for youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities and Job Corps to provide job training and employment services for youth. These programs aim to connect young people to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the future. Relevant provisions of two bills, H.R. 803 and S. 1356, are discussed in this report. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants to provide job training and employment services for youth. These programs are funded through annual appropriation acts, with Congress continuing to appropriate funds for youth job training programs. The Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration carries out these programs, except for the Youth Opportunity Grants program which has not been funded since FY2003. The Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration carries out programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities, each serving specific youth populations with employment barriers. YouthBuild requires high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Services provided vary among programs, with distinct entities implementing them. Activities program local areas (local WIBs) must provide 10 specific elements, including mentoring and follow-up, to youth in the program. YouthBuild, Job Corps, and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program offer various services to youth, with Job Corps providing residential services. Funding for these programs is allocated differently, with DOL distributing funds to local WIBs for Youth Activities, competitively awarding agreements for Job Corps centers, and awarding grants for YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. The USDA Forest Service partners with Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is working on reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) youth programs, with recent hearings addressing various issues. Stakeholders have discussed ways to improve the Youth Activities grant program. The Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety held a hearing to explore updating WIA to benefit workers and employers. During the 112th and 113th Congress, hearings and discussions were held to update and reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to address issues like declining youth employment and inefficiencies in job training programs. The House Education and Workforce Committee and Senate HELP Committee introduced bills and discussion drafts to amend WIA, with the House Committee ordering reported the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act). The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House and Senators introduced the Workforce Investment Act of 2013. Issues raised include consolidating workforce programs and giving states more flexibility in fund allocation. Consolidating workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth could lead to greater efficiency and cost savings. However, concerns exist that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups may be overlooked. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, such as education, is also a key issue. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies to address the varied needs of youth. Stakeholders are questioning the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with limited impact evaluations completed so far. The Department of Labor (DOL) has awarded a contract for an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. Concerns have been raised about the eligibility requirements for youth programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), with some arguing that income requirements may exclude needy youth. There is also debate about the emphasis on serving older youth in these programs. In light of concerns about the eligibility requirements for youth programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), stakeholders have raised issues about targeting older youth and the school status of participants in the Youth Activities program. Congress has considered proposals to address performance issues in Job Corps centers and overlapping services in federal workforce programs. The report discussed similarities and differences in youth workforce programs, recommending consolidation of certain programs. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas. The bill aims to consolidate various workforce programs, including reintegration of ex-offenders, into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, with funding distributed based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth in each state. States would need to set aside funding for a competitive grant program for youth workforce training. The bill does not have a separate funding stream for youth workforce training but requires states to allocate funding from the Workforce Investment Fund for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including low-income youth aged 16 and older. States can award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. State and local workforce investment boards must outline strategies to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience in high-demand industries. The bill aims to support at-risk youth aged 16-24 through various programs, including dropout recovery, work readiness training, and work experience. Concerns have been raised about potential reductions in youth services under the proposed Workforce Investment Fund, as it does not guarantee a minimum funding allocation for youth programs. S. 1356 aims to maintain youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for states and localities to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting youth to job training and other services, even if they are ineligible for specific programs. These centers use various methods to attract youth, as reported in a 2002 GAO study on the Youth Activities program. Local WIB directors use various methods to attract youth to one-stop centers, such as actively recruiting, placing youth program staff, and training one-stop staff. However, some areas face challenges in attracting youth unless they are referred by schools or service providers. Stakeholders recommend that one-stops cater more to youth and improve training for service professionals. DOL supports targeting youth by funding planning projects and providing guidance on enhancing youth access to one-stop centers. Local areas can enhance access for youth by co-locating youth program staff at one-stop centers, customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly,\" and designating staff to coordinate outreach and services for youth. States would be required to continue funding one-stop centers under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, but the bills do not specify how youth would be served. Each local Workforce Investment Board has a youth council responsible for developing parts of the local workforce plan for eligible youth, with members including those with expertise in youth policy, representatives from youth service and juvenile justice agencies, local law enforcement, public housing authorities, and parents. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Reports have identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, including issues with youth and parent participation due to transportation and scheduling conflicts. A 2002 report highlighted \"enabling conditions\" for successful youth councils, such as the presence of established intermediary organizations with strong reputations and infrastructure to support youth activities. The presence of an established intermediary organization with a strong reputation, a school-to-career partnership, and a community-wide planning process are key factors for successful youth councils. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, requiring them to develop a comprehensive youth plan. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress would make youth councils optional and not require local workforce investment boards to have youth representatives, but state boards must have youth representatives. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards and require them to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The bill would enable existing entities to fulfill the standing committee requirements. The existing youth councils may help facilitate youth workforce activities, and there is a perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth. WIA includes provisions for coordination between the workforce and education system, such as requiring local boards to have representatives from education entities. Stakeholders suggest that greater coordination can meet the multiple needs of youth as intended by WIA. Stakeholders suggest that existing WIA infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can facilitate coordination to meet the multiple needs of youth. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted collaboration between workforce and education systems under the Youth Activities program, with about half of youth receiving services through various entities. However, some education entities were cautious about partnering due to perceived inconsistencies with their academic mission. The collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education aims to ensure that all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive necessary services and support. Past initiatives like the School-to-Work program have shown successful joint efforts in providing work-based learning, school-based learning, and job training. Congress could learn from these programs to better serve the needs of youth. The School-to-Work program demonstrated successful collaboration between school and work systems, providing work-based learning, school-based learning, and job training. H.R. 803 and S. 1356 address coordination between workforce and education systems, with provisions to facilitate this coordination. The Senate bill S. 1356 addresses coordination between workforce and education systems by requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA in serving at-risk youth. The evaluations of youth programs authorized under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, have shown that they meet their goals. The Department of Labor has established common performance measures for these programs, which they have met or exceeded. Legislation requires continuous evaluation of these programs, with a focus on effectiveness relative to cost. Reauthorization legislation would mandate independent evaluations every five years. The 113th Congress, H.R. 803, would direct DOL to conduct independent evaluations of WIA programs every five years. Limited information on program effectiveness was found in a 2011 GAO report. Only 5 out of 47 programs had impact studies since 2004. None of the youth programs under WIA were evaluated. This lack of information makes it challenging for policymakers to determine program effectiveness. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants. Studies have focused on program implementation. DOL is conducting an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. Initial results are expected in 2015. A process evaluation of the Job Corps program was recently completed to examine center practices associated with performance measures. Practices in general center management, academic training, Career Technical Training, student life, and staff were examined. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up study found that the positive employment effects diminished 5-10 years later for individuals aged 26-34. Key factors for strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. The research found that positive employment effects of the Job Corps program diminished 5 to 10 years after random assignment for individuals aged 26-34. However, there were increased earnings for youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application. The WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs, with concerns raised about potential disincentives for serving youth with the greatest barriers to employment. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new ones for program participants. The bill passed in the House on March 15, 2013, aims to replace current youth core performance measures with new indicators for participants in activities funded under the Workforce Investment Fund. These proposed indicators include measures such as entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in employment, earnings change, attainment of credentials, participation in education or training programs, and employment in a related field. Additionally, S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, and retention in these programs. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in these programs, earnings for employed youth, attainment of credentials, participation in education or training programs leading to a recognized credential or employment, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may add more indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on these indicators. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures for accountability in workforce investment activities. Under WIA, state performance measures consist of core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18 and 19 through 21, including basic skills attainment, diplomas, employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment. States negotiate performance levels with DOL, as stakeholders argue that current measures may not fully capture progress. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures in WIA may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some programs only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement, which may deter lower-skilled youth from participating. In response, DOL issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist youth in need while still meeting performance goals. The 2010 DOL guidance advised state workforce agencies on strategies to help service providers serve at-risk youth while meeting performance goals. The guidance focused on six key strategies, including multiyear contracting and using real-time indicators to assess provider performance. GAO suggested that common measures could provide more flexibility for local programs working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for higher-risk youth populations to better serve their needs. Adjustments similar to those in the Job Training Partnership Act could be considered for WIA reauthorization. Adjustments were made under JTPA to national performance standards for youth and other populations, allowing governors to adjust standards for service delivery areas based on economic and demographic factors. This aimed to level the playing field across areas with different local conditions. WIA requires Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures for entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. Additionally, DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the program. The Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, including measures for entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. A report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results and miscalculations in the program. YouthBuild program applicants are required to include a description of results to be achieved with respect to common indicators of performance for youth and lifelong learning. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, retention rate, and recidivism rate. DOL provides guidance on these indicators to grant recipients. The YouthBuild program measures success by tracking participants' placement in employment or education, degree attainment, literacy gains, retention rate, and recidivism rate. Stakeholders debate eligibility criteria and focus on serving out-of-school and older youth. H.R. 803 requires states to assist at-risk youth and out-of-school youth but does not mandate specific percentages or funding allocations. The WIA Youth program serves youth aged 14-21 with barriers like low income, literacy deficiencies, homelessness, or being a school dropout. There is debate over the requirement for youth to prove their low-income status for eligibility, as many struggle to provide necessary documentation. State and local officials reported challenges with youth providing necessary documentation for WIA program eligibility, diverting resources from service delivery. GAO examined states' implementation of WIA Youth program and other federal programs funded by ARRA. Officials noted income eligibility requirements may exclude needy youth, and youth face difficulties proving eligibility under other criteria like foster care or homelessness. Youth may be hesitant to provide criminal records or lack family connections if homeless. Some states have requested waivers from DOL to ease eligibility criteria for youth in the WIA program. While DOL can waive certain requirements for states, participant eligibility cannot be waived. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but stakeholders argue that WIA regulations lack flexibility in documenting income and other factors. Some states prefer using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. Some states and localities preferred using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. In-school youth qualified if they met certain criteria, while out-of-school youth had to be economically disadvantaged. Stakeholders suggested adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty areas. Some groups like dropouts and homeless youth should be categorically eligible. The goal of WIA is to serve vulnerable youth. The eligibility criteria for the Youth Activities program under WIA should focus on vulnerable youth, including homeless and runaway youth, without regard to income. Stakeholders have raised concerns about whether changing eligibility requirements based on means-tested programs or residency would impact the number of eligible youth. Additionally, there is a debate on whether the program should prioritize out-of-school youth, as challenges in recruiting and retaining them persist despite the 30% funding requirement for such activities. Despite efforts to prioritize out-of-school youth in the WIA Youth program, challenges in recruiting and retaining them persist. Serving out-of-school youth is twice as costly as in-school youth, and maintaining contact with them is difficult. Stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk in-school youth. Some argue for maintaining current funding levels for out-of-school youth but increasing technical assistance to states. Some federal programs serve in-school youth, while others argue for maintaining funding for out-of-school youth and increasing technical assistance. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school youth and those at risk of dropping out. Recommendations include strong alternative education programs and funding for Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants. In FY2007, $3.4 million was provided to reconnect youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. Successful strategies for serving out-of-school youth have been identified in a 2004 report for DOL. In 2004, a report for DOL highlighted successful strategies for serving out-of-school youth, including technical assistance, resource lists, and contracting with experienced service providers. WIA eligibility is for youth aged 14-21, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extending services to those up to age 24 to address youth unemployment. The research literature suggests that young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and high living costs. Older youth face challenges like family conflict and unemployment, leading to disconnection from work or school. There is a debate on whether WIA should target these older, disconnected youth, which could strain program resources if funding remains stable. According to a GAO report on oversight of ARRA activities, 7% of the 300,000 youth in the Youth program funded by ARRA were ages 22 through 24, totaling about 21,000 youth. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both the Youth and Adult programs to meet individual needs. It is unclear how youth ages 18 through 21 choose to participate in the programs. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% recently. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% recently. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training. The Youth program also emphasizes leadership skills and community service activities, unlike the Adult program. The Youth program focuses on developing leadership skills and community service activities for youth participants, while the Adult program does not have this emphasis. Both programs offer opportunities for occupational skills training and employment links, with training activities available mainly to Adult program participants in the training component. The Youth program provides supportive services like child care and transportation, along with adult mentoring and counseling services, while the Adult program primarily focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. The Department of Labor (DOL) is seeking comments on its methodology for selecting underperforming centers for closure based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, exempt certain centers from closure, and consider the impact on specific student subpopulations. This is part of DOL's reform agenda to enhance center performance through federal oversight. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing underperforming centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. While cost is not the main factor, budget constraints highlight the need to maximize resources for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and close low-performing centers based on performance criteria. The bill requires a program improvement plan for centers with low performance indicators and mandates closure for those consistently underperforming. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close low-performing Job Corps centers based on performance criteria. The Department of Labor Secretary is required to conduct an audit ranking centers and submit a report to Congress. Within 12 months, the Secretary must close the bottom quintile centers. Similar proposals have been suggested in the past, like the Reagan Administration's plan to close inefficient centers, which was not implemented. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on various criteria. There was also a proposal to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states, but some members objected due to concerns about potential limitations on student access and funding shifts. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures, establish performance levels, and implement a performance improvement plan within a one-year period. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) developed common performance metrics for workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. These metrics include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy and numeracy gains. The common measures policy was implemented in 2003 to streamline program performance reporting. ETA issued additional guidance on the common measures, clarifying that they do not replace existing statutory reporting requirements for WIA programs. States will continue to negotiate performance goals for Youth Activities indicators. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) developed common performance metrics for workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. These metrics are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The goals for the common measures are established as part of the budget process and are set at the higher end to be ambitious. Program goals apply to the program as a whole and may need to be adjusted for individual grantees. DOL develops performance targets for the programs using regression analysis. DOL sets performance targets for workforce programs using regression analysis to adjust for different economic circumstances. Factors like program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics are considered. YouthBuild and Job Corps targets are based on the Youth Activities regression model. Common measures include placement in employment or education, with all programs meeting or exceeding goals in PY2011 and PY2012. Each program met or exceeded goals in PY2011 and PY2012. Placement in Employment or Education measures the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed in the first quarter after the program. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after the program. The agency accepts various post-secondary degrees as equivalent to a high school diploma. A work readiness certificate does not qualify. The literacy or numeracy gains measure assesses the increase in educational functional levels for out-of-school youth. Youth are initially assessed in reading, writing, and math before entering the program. The program requires youth to be tested for literacy and numeracy gains before and after entering the program, with regular testing intervals. Those not deemed basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on those needing remediation. DOL provides guidance on testing types and accommodations for disabilities."
