    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to legislative debate. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, more chemicals have entered the U.S. market, leading to a greater understanding of chemical risks. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework is not sufficiently protective, as few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated. EPA's evaluation of risks is limited by resources, leading states to enact their own regulations. Manufacturers argue that compliance with different state regulations is inefficient for chemicals in interstate commerce. Proponents argue that states should be allowed to lead the way in trying alternative approaches to chemical regulations to protect their citizens. Non-governmental programs, such as voluntary labeling, have also emerged as alternatives to regulation. Bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697). In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced in both chambers to amend Title I of TSCA. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced in the Senate. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a more targeted approach with the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was later approved by the committee and passed by the House under suspension of the rules. Key debated topics included the prioritization of existing chemical substances for risk evaluation and the regulatory criteria for restricting chemical substances. The report compares approaches in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues such as evaluating risks for chemicals, regulatory options for restricting substances, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, and resources available for EPA administration. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical risks under current TSCA without a mandate to review all chemicals. The EPA has the authority to evaluate risks for chemicals under TSCA, focusing on substances reported to the agency. Over 83,000 chemical substances are included, with 1,200 identified for evaluation in 2012. 90 substances were prioritized for risk evaluation, with 5 assessed and 3 found to present risks. For new chemicals, manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days prior to manufacturing, allowing EPA to assess risks. The EPA evaluates risks for chemicals under TSCA by prioritizing substances for risk evaluation. Manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing new chemical substances. S. 697 and S. 725 prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 directs EPA to evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. The Senate bills propose a process to prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, including active and inactive substances, with a focus on persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances. Manufacturers can request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee, with varying deadlines for evaluations under different bills. EPA would evaluate risks for substances requested by manufacturers, with different requirements under S. 697 and H.R. 2576. The Senate bills propose a prioritization process for evaluating chemical substances, with varying deadlines for regulatory actions. S. 697 requires EPA to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessments within five years. S. 725 has similar procedures with tighter deadlines. H.R. 2576 mandates risk evaluations to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they pay for the evaluation. For new chemical substances, S. 697 and S. 725 propose amending TSCA Section 5 to establish a review process, while H.R. 2576 leaves the current process in place. EPA would need to make a determination on regulatory action for new chemicals under the Senate bills. The Senate bills would direct EPA to conduct an initial review of new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN to determine if they meet safety standards. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same regulatory procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA sets a standard for regulating chemicals based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. Some argue that the regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals under TSCA is challenging for the EPA to prove. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard is not clearly defined in the statute, leading to interpretation issues. The Fifth Circuit's interpretation involves a multi-factor balancing test, as seen in the Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA case. The debate revolves around amending the threshold to clarify criteria for regulatory control. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA. The court emphasized the need to balance costs and benefits in determining regulatory actions for chemicals. S. 697 aims to define \"safety standard\" in TSCA with a focus on preventing unreasonable risk of harm to health or the environment. S. 697 and S. 725 aim to establish a statutory definition for \"safety standard\" in TSCA, focusing on preventing unreasonable risk of harm to health or the environment. Both bills include qualifiers such as considering \"conditions of use\" and \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" in evaluating risks. S. 697 specifically prohibits the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors\" in risk evaluation. H.R. 2576 does not define a \"safety standard\" like S. 697 and S. 725, but retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA. It adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, such as assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors. This contrasts with statutes like TSCA that balance costs and benefits. Title I of TSCA acknowledges the balance between costs and benefits in regulatory controls. EPA is directed to promulgate requirements to protect against unreasonable risks using the least burdensome approach. The regulatory options range from bans to notifications of risks. Some argue that this requirement leads to lengthy analyses, as seen in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA. In Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA must show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option requirement for restricting chemical substances under TSCA. Instead, they propose directing EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards, considering factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to promulgate a rule that adequately protects against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations. The bill would also amend factors for considering restrictions on chemical substances, requiring rules to be cost-effective unless impracticable. All three bills allow EPA to exempt certain chemical uses under specific circumstances, such as national security concerns or lack of feasible alternatives. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of chemical substances if deemed necessary for national security or economic reasons. The exemptions are initially valid for five years and can be renewed. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and may require reporting from manufacturers to gather necessary data. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates EPA to require testing by manufacturers and processors of chemical substances if risks are unknown. EPA can mandate testing if a chemical substance may present unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. EPA has required testing for over 200 chemical substances, but some argue that limits on EPA's authority hinder risk assessment. EPA has the authority to require testing of chemical substances if they may pose unreasonable risks to health or the environment. However, the process of developing new information for testing can be time-consuming and costly. Proposed bills would give EPA discretion to require testing if deemed necessary, with H.R. 2576 still requiring specific findings for testing. All three bills would authorize EPA to mandate new information through rulemaking or orders. The proposed bills would authorize EPA to require the development of new information by promulgating a rule, issuing an order, or entering into a testing consent agreement. The scope of TSCA preemption has been a long-standing issue, with current preemption giving EPA a primary role in managing chemicals while allowing states some ability to set their own requirements under certain circumstances. The TSCA amendment allows states to set their own chemical requirements under certain circumstances, with exceptions to preemption for state requirements that are not duplicative of federal regulations. Advocates for federal preemption argue that a uniform national regulatory framework can provide sufficient protection from chemical risks and prevent conflicting state regulations. Advocates for federal preemption argue that a uniform national regulatory framework can provide sufficient protection from chemical risks. Opponents believe states should be able to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption, allowing states to act if EPA has not taken action on a chemical, but with restrictions on state requirements. S. 697 would prohibit states from restricting the use of chemical substances that meet EPA safety standards or are restricted by EPA. States would also be prevented from imposing new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority by EPA for safety assessment. Preemption would depend on EPA's determination of the chemical's safety standard. Exceptions to preemption provided by current TSCA would generally be retained, except for the removal of the exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use. S. 697 would retain preemption exceptions from current TSCA, except for the removal of the exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use. States could establish or enforce some requirements under state environmental laws, with certain limitations. Waivers could be granted based on peer-reviewed science concerns about a chemical. EPA would have to grant waivers meeting statutory requirements. S. 725 and H.R. 2576 propose changes to TSCA preemption provisions. S. 725 would allow states to impose different regulations for chemicals, while H.R. 2576 would preempt state laws if EPA determines a chemical poses no unreasonable risk. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions, aligning preemption with the risk evaluation process. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption. The bill also addresses a state's ability to enforce identical requirements to EPA's, with exceptions for actions taken before August 2015 and past or future state actions under certain laws. Additionally, the bill includes savings clauses for common law causes of action and court authorities in civil actions. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to submit information to EPA, balancing public access with protection of competitive information. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act. CBI protection does not cover health and safety studies but protects data within them. Confidential business information (CBI) protection under TSCA prohibits disclosure of manufacturing processes or proprietary mixture compositions. EPA can disclose CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment. Submitters only need to designate information as CBI for protection, and substantiation or EPA review is not required. CBI protection continues indefinitely unless EPA determines otherwise. The EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies since 2010. They have also initiated the \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims. The three proposed bills aim to retain TSCA's framework for protecting information falling under the FOIA trade secrets exemption but would require or authorize EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances. The Senate bills propose extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They would protect certain categories of information from disclosure, such as specific chemical identities before commercial distribution. H.R. 2576 would protect chemical identities in health and safety studies and require submitters to substantiate confidentiality claims. H.R. 2576 would limit substantiation requirements for confidentiality claims made after enactment and require EPA to notify submitters before claim expiration. Congress faces a decision on funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or dedicated supplemental funding sources. TSCA appropriations were authorized through FY1983, with continued funding through annual appropriations and EPA's authority to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. EPA's fee collection authority is limited to a maximum of $2,500 for specific actions. The EPA has the authority to collect fees for specific actions under Section 5 of the statute, with a maximum limit of $2,500. Small businesses have a fee limit of $100. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization for fee collection. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 address the authority to collect fees under TSCA. S. 697 would authorize fee collection for submissions to EPA, with a cap of $18 million and funds deposited in a dedicated account. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for evaluating chemical substances. The bills establish a dedicated fund for fee receipts, with amounts available annually without fiscal year limitation. EPA can collect fees sufficient to cover costs without a statutory limit per notice submission. S. 725 authorizes EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers without a statutory limit per notice submission. Fees collected would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and made available subject to discretionary appropriations."
