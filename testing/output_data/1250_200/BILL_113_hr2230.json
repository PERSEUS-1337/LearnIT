    "content": "The \"Track It to Prevent It Act\" includes provisions for improved climate assessments, service-wide 360 assessments, health welfare inspections, and reviews of security and diversity management in the military. It also authorizes appropriations for these measures. Congress found an increase in reported sexual assault cases in the Armed Forces in fiscal year 2012, with a significant rise in anonymous reports. A high percentage of female and male members who experienced unwanted sexual contact also faced sexual harassment. Retaliation was perceived by a majority of those who reported unwanted sexual contact. Climate assessments are required by law for commanders to create a safe environment for their unit. Trends in bad behavior like sexual harassment and assault must be identified earlier through improved performance assessments. Members often do not report incidents due to fear of retaliation and negative impact on their military career. Commanders condoning or ignoring sexual misconduct perpetuates this behavior in the military. Continued prevalence of sexual misconduct in the military hinders cultural change. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"sexual harassment\" is defined in Department of Defense Directive 1350.2, and \"sexual assault\" refers to offenses described in section 920 of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and higher levels of command. Senior commanders must indicate compliance with assessments in performance evaluations, failure to conduct assessments will impact promotions. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will create a tracking system for assessments. Defense will develop a system to track commanders' conduct of command climate assessments. Unit commanders, in collaboration with the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, will compile climate assessments and create a compliance report including concerns expressed by unit members, perceptions of leadership, and a strategic plan to address concerns. The Secretary of Defense will require commanders to include reprimands and counseling statements for cases of sexual harassment or assault in performance evaluations to increase visibility, identify trends of bad behavior, and prevent the transfer of offenders. Additionally, there will be service-wide 360 assessments implemented. SEC. 6. SERVICE-WIDE 360 ASSESSMENTS. The Secretary of each military department will develop a 360-degree assessment program modeled after the Department of the Army Multi-Source Assessment and Feedback Program. A report on the feasibility of including the 360-degree approach in performance evaluation reports must be submitted to Congress. Individual counseling will be included in the performance evaluation process.\n\nSEC. 7. HEALTH WELFARE INSPECTIONS. Monthly health welfare inspections will be conducted by each military department to ensure security, military readiness, good order, and discipline. Results will be provided to both the commander and senior commander. SEC. 8. REVIEW OF SECURITY OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, INCLUDING BARRACKS AND MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENCES. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. The review will identify security gaps and assess the feasibility of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. A report with cost estimates to address security gaps and implement 24-hour monitoring must be submitted to Congress within 90 days. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations to address security gaps and provide 24-hour security monitoring. The Secretary of Defense will review the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity's role in sexual harassment cases, evaluate resource gaps, and assess collaboration with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the review in fiscal year 2014."
