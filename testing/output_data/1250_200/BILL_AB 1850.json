    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on 20 days of hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) concluded that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and was driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, acknowledging the grave personal injustice done to Japanese-Americans during World War II. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violation of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. The actions were motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria, resulting in significant human suffering. The Education Code is also amended in response to these findings. The Education Code is amended to establish a state test for eligible aliens seeking permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This test would assess their understanding of English, history, and government of the United States to meet federal requirements.
