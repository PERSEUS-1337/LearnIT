    "content": "The income exclusion provisions for civilians serving in combat zones include exemptions for military personnel and U.S. citizens working overseas. Military pay has been exempt from taxation during wartime for those in combat zones since 1913. The Internal Revenue Code exempts compensation for active service in combat zones. Exclusions include active duty pay, imminent danger/hostile fire pay, and reenlistment bonuses for members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in combat zones. The income exclusion provisions for military personnel serving in combat zones include active duty pay, imminent danger/hostile fire pay, reenlistment bonuses, pay for accrued leave, pay for duties in nonappropriated fund activities, awards for suggestions made in combat zones, and student loan repayments. Most states extend the combat zone income tax exclusion to state income tax, but the specifics vary. Some states mirror federal provisions for tax incentives for military personnel serving in combat, while others have different laws. In Michigan, all military pay is exempt, while in Mississippi, enlisted members can exclude all combat income and officers up to $500 per month. A proposed civilian combat zone exclusion would provide additional tax savings for overseas personnel. U.S. federal civilian employees working abroad can exclude certain allowances under Section 912 of the IRC, while other citizens can exclude foreign earned income and housing expenses under Section 911. Section 911 of the IRC allows U.S. citizens to exclude up to $82,400 in foreign earned income and certain housing expenses. To qualify for the income tax exclusion, a person must be a U.S. citizen, have their tax home in a foreign country, and be a resident of that country or have lived abroad for at least 330 days. All U.S. citizens can credit foreign taxes paid against their U.S. income taxes, but federal employees are usually exempt from foreign taxes. The tax treatment of income earned abroad is justified by differences in cost of living and income tax rates experienced by U.S. citizens overseas. In recent Congresses, proposals were made to modify the income tax exclusion for U.S. citizens working abroad. The Federal Employee Combat Zone Tax Parity Act was introduced to expand the armed forces income tax exclusion to include federal civilians employed in combat zones. Another proposal aimed to exclude compensation earned by certain DOD civilian employees in combat zones from gross income. These changes aim to address the differences in tax liabilities faced by individuals working overseas compared to those in the United States. The proposal aims to extend the combat zone tax treatment to civilian employees of DOD serving in combat zones, including civilian contractors. This federal subsidy treats income earned in combat favorably compared to other income, influencing economic behavior and resource allocation. The military tax benefit aims to reduce tax burdens for military personnel during wartime, rather than incentivizing employment in combat zones. Tax incentives are used to encourage economic activity, but market failures may occur due to inefficiencies in resource allocation. Tax subsidies can remedy market failures and improve economic efficiency. The combat zone income tax exclusion does not address market failure or improve economic efficiency. It is unlikely to distort behavior and may not lower efficiency. The exclusion does not incentivize individuals to serve in combat but is simply an additional benefit for members of the Armed Forces. Extending the exclusion to federal civilian employees or civilian contract employees raises questions about its purpose, which has not been stated by proponents. The purpose of extending the combat zone income tax exclusion to federal civilian employees or civilian contract employees is unclear. It could be to provide additional compensation for those serving in combat or to achieve equity with the armed forces. However, economists question the efficiency of using a tax subsidy instead of direct payment for this purpose. The combat zone income tax exclusion provides a subsidy for income earned while in combat, such as hazardous duty pay. Implementing a tax benefit for this purpose would increase military spending costs but would not require an appropriations process. Income tax exclusions vary in beneficiaries based on income, marital status, and dependents. Married individuals filing joint returns comprised 39.1% of all tax returns in 2001. The distribution of taxes among income groups is influenced by differences in household composition and the number of dependents. The income tax system is progressive, meaning higher taxable income incurs a greater percentage of taxes. Exclusions from taxation benefit more those in higher tax brackets. Lower-paid individuals may owe little to no federal taxes due to exemptions and deductions. Federal civilians cannot benefit from the $82,400 income tax exclusion, but can exclude housing and certain allowances. Non-federal civilians benefit from the income exclusion if they meet the required criteria, such as being overseas for most of the year. Private sector civilians may claim the exclusion if they meet the 330-day requirement. An income tax exclusion for non-federal civilians in combat zones benefits certain individuals. An income tax exclusion for non-federal civilians in combat zones would primarily benefit high-income households, potentially reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Extending the combat zone exclusion to civilians may aim to equalize benefits with the Armed Forces, but distinctions between military service and civilian employment are crucial for policy analysis. Military personnel in combat zones are not subject to foreign taxes on their income, so they do not require a foreign tax credit to offset taxes paid abroad. Military personnel in combat zones have distinct duties and obligations compared to civilian employees. They cannot resign when facing danger, refuse assignments, or work on a set schedule. They are under constant duty and may work until the job is completed without specific compensation. Unlike civilians, military members are controlled by a chain of command and must obey lawful orders or face criminal punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This level of authority does not extend to civilian employees. Civilians in combat zones, including government employees, contractors, and war correspondents, are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice like military personnel. Advocates argue that extending income tax exclusion to civilians would show national gratitude for their service in dangerous situations. These civilians often work near hostilities, wearing uniforms and carrying weapons, making them vulnerable to being mistaken as combatants. Supporters argue for extending income tax exclusion to civilians in combat, stating that they are as likely as military personnel to become casualties. Data from the Iraq war shows that civilian DOD employees had a lower fatality rate compared to military personnel and contractors. It is suggested that civilians in dangerous assignments demonstrate readiness to put themselves in harm's way, warranting equitable treatment in tax exclusion. Supporters argue for extending income tax exclusion to civilians in combat zones, as they demonstrate readiness to put themselves in harm's way. Federal civilian employees in combat zones already receive benefits like danger pay allowances, providing additional compensation for hazardous working conditions. Imminent danger pay is administered by the Department of State, offering extra compensation to civilian DOD employees based on the level of danger in their area of assignment. Opponents of extending income tax exclusion to civilian contractors argue that their higher salaries already serve as a risk premium for working in combat zones. Exempting civilian income from federal taxation could make civilian service more financially attractive than military service, potentially impacting military recruitment and retention. Private contractors in Iraq can earn between $350 to $1,500 a day, leading to concerns that these high salaries attract experienced military personnel away from the Armed Forces. Private contractors in Iraq can earn high salaries, with examples such as a former Green Beret making up to $1,000 a day. Reports show that contractors can make two to 10 times more than they would in the military. For instance, a contract awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paid $350,000 per year for disposing of captured munitions. The Defense Contract Audit Agency found that contractors in Iraq received various allowances, differentials, bonuses, and benefits in addition to base pay. Private contractors in Iraq receive various allowances, differentials, bonuses, and benefits in addition to base pay. Most contractors offer hardship pay, danger pay allowance, assignment completion bonuses, and foreign service premium. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, 83% of deployed civilians were contractors, performing a range of roles from vehicle maintenance to security forces. The distinction between civilian DOD employees and contractors complicates equalization of benefits. DOD employees and civilian contractors complicate equalization of benefits for civilians and members of the Armed Forces. Civilian DOD personnel operate with similar commitment and control as military personnel, while contractors may not. Commanders have some control over civilian DOD employees, but penalties are administrative, not criminal. Contractors, unlike government employees, are employed by third parties under contract to the United States. Military commanders have less control over contractors, with the main recourse being contract cancellation for non-compliance. Combat zone income tax exclusion places administrative burden on the employer. The combat zone income tax exclusion places administrative burden on employers, who are responsible for separating nontaxable income from taxable income and reporting it to both employees and the IRS. Designation of combat zones can be done by the President or Congress, with the DOD having authority to extend tax benefits to military personnel providing direct support to combat zones. Three combat zones are currently designated, including the Persian Gulf area. The U.S. Armed Forces are engaged in combat operations in the Persian Gulf area and other designated regions. Military personnel in various countries are eligible for combat zone tax benefits. Certifications for Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea area have been issued, with some expiring on specific dates. Military operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan have been designated as combat zones for tax relief purposes. Areas including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Albania, the Adriatic Sea, and the Ionian Sea are qualified hazardous duty areas. Afghanistan and its airspace have also been designated as combat zones. Military personnel in Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan are eligible for combat zone tax benefits. DOD has certified military personnel in Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan for combat zone tax benefits. Effective dates for certification vary. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia are designated as qualified hazardous duty areas. The countries certified for combat zone tax benefits include Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan. U.S. peace-keeping troops in Joint Endeavor or Operation Able Sentry qualify for combat zone compensation exclusion under Code Section 112."
