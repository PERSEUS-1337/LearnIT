The Act \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" highlights findings on severe poverty in the developing world, high child mortality rates, preventable deaths from malnutrition, and the challenges faced by women in poverty. It emphasizes the positive impact of aiding the poorest, especially women, on family well-being and education. Women in poverty often lack stable employment and turn to self-employment for livelihood. Many women in poverty lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading them to turn to self-employment for income. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This initiative could benefit nearly half of the world's absolute poor population. Microcredit institutions like Grameen Bank and Accion International provide loans to the very poor, with high repayment rates. These institutions help reduce poverty and dependency on foreign assistance by generating income from credit portfolios. Loans are recycled, leveraging foreign assistance resources for sustained long-term development. The development of sustainable microcredit institutions is crucial for poverty reduction and economic development. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative to expand funding for microenterprise programs, with a goal to support programs providing credit to the poorest. However, funding for microenterprise activities decreased in fiscal year 1996, impacting programs benefiting the poorest. Increased investment in microcredit institutions is needed. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the Microcredit Summit will require only a modest increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest. To reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microcredit institutions and assist them in developing their institutional capacity. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and other NGOs to expand microcredit institutions and provide financial services to the world's poorest families. AID can lead efforts to support microenterprise for the poorest and improve coordination among development aid agencies. The Act aims to continue and expand AID's support for microcredit institutions and make microenterprise development a key part of AID's economic growth strategy. It also focuses on enhancing the capacity of US PVOs and other NGOs to provide financial services to microentrepreneurs, especially women, in developing countries. The Act seeks to increase assistance for the poorest sector by improving coordination and promoting best practices in delivering financial services. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"AID\", \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", and \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\". The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs for microenterprises in developing countries. Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations, including credit unions and private financial intermediaries. Eligibility criteria will be set by the Administrator based on lack of access to formal financial sector and poverty levels of recipients. The entity focuses on providing credit to the poorest people, especially poor women, and aims to become financially self-reliant by charging realistic interest rates. Funding levels for fiscal year 1999 require a minimum of $160,000,000 to be used for assistance under the Act, separate from funds allocated for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The FREEDOM Support Act allocates funds for poverty lending, support of PVOs and NGOs, and a matching grant program. The FREEDOM Support Act allocates funds for poverty lending and supports United States PVOs through a matching grant program. The program defines \"to support poverty lending\" as providing funds to the poverty target population in low-income countries, with loans of $300 or less in 1997 US dollars. The FREEDOM Support Act allocates funds for poverty lending to the poorest 50 percent living below the poverty line in low-income countries. SEC. 5. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. The Administrator of AID is required to strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop mechanisms for targeting microcredit to the poorest population. A monitoring system must be established to set performance goals, measure project achievements, and recommend adjustments to enhance assistance for the very poor, especially women. The Administrator of AID must establish a monitoring system to track microenterprise credit and loans to the poverty target population. They are also required to report annually to Congress on the progress of achieving the Microcredit Summit goal. The Administrator of AID is implementing a plan to expand access to credit and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, by 2005. This information will be included in AID's annual presentation to Congress."
