    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Empowering Parents and Teachers for a Drug-Free Education Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that a significant percentage of high school students in 2001 had used illicit drugs and alcohol, with increasing use of MDMA among 12th graders. This substance abuse poses risks to student health, safety, and the school environment. Illicit drug and alcohol use among students can have serious health effects, including life-threatening diseases and death. Drugs like marijuana and ecstasy can kill brain cells, affecting learning abilities. Chemicals in the central nervous system from marijuana use can lead to disruptive behavior in the classroom. Students who smoke or use drugs have shown less desire to learn and lower grades, along with a higher rate of breaking school rules. SEC. 3. DRUG-FREE SCHOOL DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS. Amends the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act to include Drug-Free School Demonstration Programs. The Secretary may grant funds to local educational agencies and private schools for drug-free school demonstration programs. These programs must include random drug testing of students, the use of FDA-approved tests, analysis by certified labs, review by a medical officer, and no disclosure to law enforcement. The random drug testing program for students includes strict confidentiality measures, destruction of records for unconfirmed results, and parental notification and opt-out rights. Records must be destroyed when students graduate or leave the school. The school's policy on behavior prohibits students from attending school under the influence of drugs or alcohol, prohibits drug possession on school grounds, and outlines consequences for violations. The school also provides drug and alcohol abuse prevention training, access to a student assistance program, and ongoing substance abuse education. The drug-free school demonstration program includes short-term problem resolution and provides continuing alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse prevention education. It ensures confidentiality of student drug test results, prohibits mandatory disclosure of medical information, and requires written reporting of test results for confidentiality. Technical assistance may be provided through contracts with public and private entities for program implementation. The drug-free school demonstration program offers assistance to local educational agencies and private schools for implementing drug prevention programs. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary with required information. Definitions for terms like 'medical review officer' and 'student' are provided in the section. The Secretary of Education will report on the drug-free school demonstration programs within 18 months of the Act's enactment. An authorization of $25,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2005 and subsequent years for these programs. Amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to support drug-free school initiatives. The item relating to subpart 4 of part A of title IV is redesignated as the item relating to subpart 5 of part A of title IV. Additionally, after the item relating to section 4141, a new item is inserted. \"Subpart 4 - Drug-free school demonstration programs 4145. Drug-free school demonstration programs.\""
