    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certificates. There is a growing demand for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree. Despite the federal government providing over $100 billion in financial aid for postsecondary education annually, most of these funds do not support non-degree programs. Several proposals have surfaced recently to increase federal support for students pursuing non-degree programs, including short-term training and education programs. The Department of Education experimented with allowing Pell Grants for these programs from 2011 to 2017. Congress may consider options for providing direct federal support to individuals pursuing postsecondary non-degree programs. In 2017, the Department of Education experimented with allowing Pell Grants for short-term non-degree postsecondary education programs. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers proposed options to bring individuals back into the workforce with necessary skills, including expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs. Stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter duration programs. Some stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter non-degree programs, but concerns exist about the quality, costs, and potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Questions have been raised about the diminishing labor market returns for some technical non-degree programs over time. Additionally, some non-degree programs may not be required or preferred by employers. Some non-degree educational programs may not be required or preferred by employers, leading to potential difficulties in securing employment over the long term. Employers are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring, which may crowd out non-degree holders from certain occupations. Federal programs and benefits exist to support individuals in non-degree training and education programs, with a need for additional policy approaches to further support these programs. Policy approaches support training and education through non-degree programs, addressing employer demand and key characteristics. Six federal programs and three tax benefits provide financial support to students in non-degree programs, highlighting gaps and limitations. Stimuli for promoting financial support include unfulfilled employer needs hindering economic growth. The report highlights the importance of non-degree programs in addressing employer needs and promoting economic growth. Data shows that 6.2% of jobs in the national economy require a non-degree postsecondary credential. Mean annual wages for these occupations are also provided in Table 1. Non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs vary in classification, with some provided by educational institutions and others by employers. Research shows that individuals with certain certificates, especially in technical and health fields, can earn higher wages. Mean annual wages for occupations requiring a high school diploma, some college, or a non-degree credential are similar, but there are significant earnings differentials within these categories. Postsecondary non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering a combination of courses or curriculum without awarding a degree. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate to expand knowledge, skills, prepare for further education, employment, or promotion. Non-degree instructional programs aim to expand knowledge and skills, prepare for employment, sustain employment, and seek promotion. These programs do not lead to postbaccalaureate certificates or transfer programs. They are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials. Various entities offer non-degree instructional programs, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions and trade schools. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of institutions including colleges, universities, trade schools, businesses, and government entities. These programs vary in length and may range from a few days to over two years, depending on curriculum requirements and industry expectations. Program duration can also be influenced by minimum educational hours required for employment, certification, or licensing. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length and may be offered in classrooms, online, or through a combination of methods. Students are responsible for funding program costs, which can vary based on length, resource requirements, and provider. For example, average tuition and fees were over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and approximately $15,000 at private less-than-two-year colleges in AY2018-2019. Programs may be structured as credit courses or noncredit courses, but both types can lead to industry recognition and vocational objectives. Credit programs are approved by accrediting entities and have stricter requirements. They can lead to various vocations and offer transferable credits. Noncredit programs, on the other hand, do not offer credits but may provide vocational certificates. They are more affordable, cover a wider range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. Noncredit programs are less expensive, cover a broad range of topics, and can be quickly modified to meet industry and student needs. They may satisfy career entry requirements, offer ABE and ESL instruction, provide personal enrichment, and customized training. Enrollment data from nine colleges showed 38% in noncredit courses: vocational (18%), ABE (9%), ESL (7%), and GED (4%). National data on non-degree programs are incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data. A 2016 survey found 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree certificates. In AY2017-2018, educational institutions awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees. Work-based learning includes various training activities to impart workplace skills, such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. Earn and learn programs provide wages or remuneration, while RA programs are a distinctive form of work-based learning. Work-based learning programs, including earn and learn programs and RA programs overseen by the DOL, require registration with DOL or a DOL-approved state agency. Registration includes a work process schedule outlining competencies and must be reviewed every five years for compliance. Entities like employers, labor unions, and external organizations can offer work-based learning experiences. Work-based learning experiences are provided by various entities such as employers, labor unions, external training providers, and educational institutions. These experiences are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee. RA programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and typically last four years. Programs can be time-based or competency-based, or a hybrid of both approaches. Work-based learning programs may be hybrid programs combining time-based and competency-based approaches. Program costs include fees for trainers, trainee wages, and lost work time. Trainees may need to cover living costs and related instruction expenses. Data on work-based training are limited and vary in methodology and purpose. Some trainees may not receive remuneration and must provide for their own expenses. The data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology and purpose. Surveys show that while most establishments offer some training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranges from 16% to 70%. In 2016, 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported around 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with the construction industry having the largest share of apprenticeships. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, with federal programs providing financial support for training and education. Key programs include the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. These programs aim to support individuals in pursuing non-degree training and education. The federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance provide financial support for training and education. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, encourages workforce development by subsidizing training costs. IRS administers tax benefits for post-education financial support. VA administers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for educational and training support. Other programs offer training and education assistance for needy families. The report discusses federal programs that provide training and education assistance for needy families, such as SNAP Employment & Training and TANF. These programs aim to support individuals at risk of educational failure and develop a more skilled workforce. WIOA Title I is highlighted as the primary federal workforce development legislation. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P.L. 113-128) is the main federal workforce development legislation aimed at increasing coordination among workforce programs. WIOA Title I, administered by DOL, focuses on improving employment outcomes, increasing postsecondary credentials, reducing welfare dependency, and meeting employer skill needs. The Adult and Dislocated Worker program provides grants to states for One-Stop delivery systems, career services, training, employer relationships, and industry partnerships. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides career services, training, and industry partnerships for adult and dislocated workers. Participants have consumer choice in selecting services, including basic and individualized career services. Eligible participants can pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider of their choice listed on the state's ETPL. Training providers include institutions of higher education and public or private training providers. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), training programs leading to a recognized postsecondary credential can be supported with WIOA Title I funds. Training activities include non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning like OJT and customized training. The training must be for occupations in demand locally or in areas where the trainee is willing to relocate. Programs must lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, employment, or measurable skill gains. Up to 20% of adult and dislocated worker funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), training programs leading to a recognized postsecondary credential can be supported with WIOA Title I funds. Local areas can reserve up to 20% of adult and dislocated worker funds for incumbent worker training. WIOA provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 or older, regardless of qualifying characteristics. Individualized career services are offered to help individuals obtain and retain employment. Eligibility for training requires the individual to be unlikely to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, in need of training services, possess the necessary skills for training, select a training service linked to an occupation in the local area, and be unable to obtain other grants. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), training programs leading to a recognized postsecondary credential can be supported with WIOA Title I funds. Local areas can reserve up to 20% of adult and dislocated worker funds for incumbent worker training. Priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) designate One-Stop operators to assess and evaluate individuals for access to training services. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services, with discretion on fund allocation among priority groups left to the local WDB in consultation with the state's governor. Under WIOA, training can be provided through ITAs or contracts for services, with funds also available for supportive services. Individuals eligible for training services can choose from the ETPL, where an ITA is established for payment to the ETP. Local WDBs have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts. ITA funds can support non-degree programs and related instruction. Supportive services like transportation, child care, and housing can also be provided by local WDBs. Under WIOA, local WDBs can provide supportive services such as transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments to enable individuals to participate in training. Training can be carried out through the ITA model or through contracts for services, which involve agreements between local WDBs, employers, or RA sponsors for occupational training in exchange for reimbursement. This approach may be used when consumer choice requirements are met, and when there is a lack of training providers in the area or a need for training in in-demand occupations. Local WDBs can contract training services for individuals in in-demand occupations or sectors, reimbursing providers for wages up to 50% (or 75% in limited cases). State and local WDBs may also reimburse RA sponsors for up to 75% of apprentice wages. Training programs are administered by WDBs and One-Stop operators, with quality assurance processes for provider eligibility. Criteria for funding eligible training providers in workforce investment areas are established by the governor and state WDB. State establishes criteria and procedures for training providers to receive funding in local workforce areas. RA programs automatically eligible for state ETPL. Non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing providers must follow procedures for continued eligibility. WIOA provides general requirements, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors such as OJT contract duration and employer eligibility for funding. In determining employer eligibility for WIOA incumbent worker training funding, local WDBs consider individual characteristics and training's impact on competitiveness without setting quantifiable targets. ETPs and states report program participation and outcomes, with RA programs exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit performance and cost data every two years to the governor for continued eligibility, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, and cost of attendance for WIOA Title I participants. The governor may require specific performance information for program eligibility, including postsecondary credentials received, cost of attendance, and completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports detailing participant training services, costs, and barriers to employment. The ETP performance reports must include the number of participants served by WIOA Title I programs, disaggregated by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Data from 2017 shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants, with the majority being age 30 and over and unemployed. Few participants engage in work-based learning, with most pursuing skills training or upgrading through non-degree instructional and degree programs. The majority of WIOA Title I participants pursue skills training or upgrading through non-degree instructional and degree programs with ITAs. Popular occupations for adults include healthcare, transportation, and production, while dislocated workers focus on transportation, computer, office support, and management. WIOA Title I supports adult entry into the workforce primarily through career services, but could benefit from increased access to non-degree training, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxation of incumbent training limits, and removal of training recipient restrictions. The Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance programs for students at certain institutions. Grants and loans are available to financially needy students. Pell Grants and federal student loans are the primary types of aid provided. The programs aim to promote access, affordability, and completion of higher education. The availability of aid follows students to eligible postsecondary education institutions. The Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs provide portable aid to eligible individuals for postsecondary education. Pell Grants and Direct Loans are available regardless of congressional appropriations. The Direct Loan program is a mandatory entitlement program, while the Pell Grant program is considered a quasi-entitlement. Both programs can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions. Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions must meet specific criteria, including quality assurance. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential, and Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs. Work-based learning programs must be supervised by the institution, with OJT portions limited if offered by an external entity. Non-degree programs offered by Title IV-eligible institutions have specific durational requirements for Pell Grants and Direct Loan programs. Pell Grants require at least 15 weeks of instructional time and a certain number of clock hours or credit hours, while Direct Loan programs need at least 10 weeks of instructional time and 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible institutions have specific durational requirements for Pell Grants and Direct Loan programs. Pell Grants require at least 15 weeks of instructional time and a certain number of clock hours or credit hours, while Direct Loan programs need at least 10 weeks of instructional time and 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Eligibility for Title IV funds requires enrollment in an eligible program, U.S. citizenship or eligible noncitizen status, a high school diploma or equivalent, and meeting program-specific criteria for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans. To receive Pell Grants, students must meet program-specific criteria including being enrolled in an undergraduate program, not having completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrating financial need. Recipients are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters. For Direct Loan program loans, students must be enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be required for specific loan types, such as Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for any student, and PLUS Loans for parents or graduate students. New borrowers must meet specific requirements. The amount of Title IV aid for students is determined by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the cost of attendance. Pell Grants are awarded without considering other financial assistance. Annual appropriations and the Higher Education Act set the maximum Pell Grant amount a student can receive. For the award year 2020-2021, the maximum Pell Grant award for a full-time student is $6,345, which may be adjusted based on various factors. Pell Grants used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those for degree programs are taxed only if not used for tuition. Direct Loan program rules vary by loan type, and other factors can impact aid amount. Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits based on statutory rules. Other financial assistance received must be considered when awarding Direct Loans. The Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits based on statutory rules. Dependent undergraduate students can borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, handling tasks like system maintenance, customer service, and program integrity. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, including providing customer service, training, and user support for program administration. IHEs handle day-to-day functions like verifying student eligibility, calculating aid amounts, and managing program funds. Program integrity provisions ensure quality and oversight through state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. State authorization, accreditation, and ED certification are key components of the program integrity triad for Title IV programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. State approval and licensure requirements vary among states, with some states approving individual educational programs while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. States may evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, and student outcomes differently. State approval and licensure requirements vary by state, evaluating program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, and student outcomes. To participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by a recognized accrediting agency, which evaluates faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and success. Accrediting agencies evaluate various aspects of an institution, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. They have discretion in the evaluation measures used. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes, but can be sought for employer and licensure requirements. Institutions seeking Title IV participation must apply for certification from the Department of Education, which evaluates program eligibility requirements. The Department of Education (ED) evaluates whether an institution meets Title IV participation requirements by reviewing each educational program for eligibility. Programs must meet specific criteria such as completion and placement rates. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The 2014 gainful employment regulations, which established debt-to-earnings rates, were rescinded in 2019. The Gainful Employment (GE) framework established debt-to-earnings rates for educational programs to measure program quality. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. Programs must also meet third-party standards and educational prerequisites for licensure. The Higher Education Act (HEA) does not define performance measures for Title IV programs. The Higher Education Act (HEA) does not define performance measures for Title IV programs, but requires reporting of enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, and student charges. Data shows that a significant number of non-degree for-credit programs are offered by private for-profit IHEs, while public IHEs award the majority of non-degree for-credit credentials. In AY2015-2016, around 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Support for non-degree programs is limited in various ways, including eligibility criteria and program quality assessment. Non-degree program quality is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad, with state authorizers and accreditors having flexibility in determining criteria. Variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessing institutional experiences. Potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements include concerns about oversight, conflicts of interest, and input requirements. State boards may face challenges due to conflicts of interest, overrepresentation of special interests, and lengthy authorization processes. There are conflicts across state laws for institutions offering programs in multiple states. Despite reporting requirements on student outcomes, few states base authorization renewal decisions on these outcomes. A 2014 GAO report highlighted strengths and weaknesses of accreditation, such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment. Weaknesses include conflicting interests and insufficient accreditor oversight. Education tax benefits, administered by the Internal Revenue Service, offset some costs of higher education for eligible taxpayers. They provide advantages to upper middle-income taxpayers and are claimed when filing federal income tax returns. Taxpayers receive benefits after paying for education expenses, sometimes months later. Some benefits are only available to individuals in degree programs, with eligibility rules in place. Education tax benefits, such as the Lifetime Learning Credit, provide financial assistance for education expenses. These benefits are available to individuals in non-degree programs and can be claimed when filing federal income tax returns. They are considered a form of \"spending through the tax code\" and may incentivize overconsumption of education. The Lifetime Learning Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses for individuals pursuing education. It phases out for taxpayers above certain income thresholds. Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes eligible employer provided educational costs from taxable income. 529 accounts help families save for future educational expenses and can be used for eligible education expenses at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment. Expenses not required for enrollment must be reduced by tax-free educational assistance. This assistance can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses improving job skills. Employer-provided educational assistance can cover non-work-related courses or non-degree programs. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses like tuition and fees. To qualify for tax benefits, participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent or spouse. Taxpayers can claim the credit for education expenses for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. The tax credit cannot be claimed if filing as married filing separately, if they are nonresident aliens, or if income is $68,000 or more ($136,000 or more if married filing jointly). Participants can use this tax benefit if their employer offers educational assistance. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at its establishment. Individuals can apply for the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) when filing their federal income tax return after incurring qualified educational expenses. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. Employers may provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance. Taxpayers can withdraw funds from their 529 accounts tax-free for qualifying education expenses. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for benefit administration. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing Form 1040 and IRS Form 8863. Taxpayers can apply for the LLC by filing their federal income tax return (Form 1040) and IRS Form 8863. The forms describe eligibility rules and help calculate the credit amount. An employer's educational assistance program must meet specific requirements and cannot discriminate in favor of certain employees. Employees eligible for 529 plans must receive notice of terms. States sponsor 529 plans, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from 529 plans are reported on Form 1099-Q. Non-eligible expenses may be subject to taxation. Taxpayers do not need to document how withdrawals are spent unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. In 2015, approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC tax credit, with half claimed by taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $200,000. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Data on employer provided educational assistance are unavailable for evaluation. The impact of employer provided educational assistance and 529 plans on enrollment in non-degree programs and job skills improvement has not been evaluated. Research on education tax benefits shows limited effect on increasing enrollment, with delays in receiving benefits and confusion over different benefits being potential limitations. The education tax benefits discussed in this report primarily benefit taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income taxpayers. Veterans education programs like GI Bills aim to help former servicemembers transition to civilian life and provide various benefits to promote military retention. VET TEC is an alternative approach incentivizing training providers for program completion and employment, separate from GI Bills. VET TEC is a program that incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, separate from the GI Bills. It is funded by a limited allocation from GI Bill appropriations. The Post-9/11 GI Bill represents the majority of GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013, supporting education through degree pursuit and work-based learning programs. VET TEC benefits support students in non-degree high-technology programs at approved training providers. The programs include computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Training providers must meet specific criteria and not charge tuition or offer degrees. The VET TEC program offers benefits for non-degree high-technology programs in areas like computer programming, software, and data processing. Eligibility is based on meeting specific criteria and being a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available to eligible servicemembers, veterans, and their family members, with living stipend payments provided directly to participants. The VET TEC program and Bill provide living stipend payments and cover program costs. Eligible individuals can receive personalized counseling for career guidance. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational assistance payments over 36 months, with various benefit payment options based on factors like benefit level and type of education pursued. Transfer of benefits requires sharing the entitlement period. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments based on an individual's qualifying active duty service. Payments cover tuition, fees, housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, and additional monthly payments. Veterans pursuing OJT or apprenticeship receive a decreasing housing allowance to offset wage increases. Under VET TEC, veterans receive a monthly housing allowance similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment. Participants apply to the VA for eligibility and enroll in approved programs. Educational institutions certify enrollment to the VA. Institutions and training establishments certify enrollment and pursuit of eligible individuals to the VA. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payments, and distributes them. Program quality for GI Bill-approved programs is overseen by state approving agencies, while VET TEC programs focus on participant employment outcomes. The VA and SAAs share responsibility for program oversight. Quality standards are established for educational programs, institutions, and training establishments. Quality standards for educational programs, institutions, and training establishments have been established to ensure program objectives are met and to prevent abuse. Key standards include program objective, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. Additional requirements vary depending on the type of program. The GI Bill sets standards for educational programs, including requirements for facilities, instructors, curricula, and meeting state licensure or certification standards. Non-degree programs must meet various criteria, such as FAA approval for flight training programs and faculty qualifications. The VA is the final authority in approving programs. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC based on facility qualifications, curriculum alignment, and meeting standards. Payment structure ensures program quality by reimbursing providers upon veteran completion and meaningful employment within 180 days. Providers must be licensed, meet the 85-15 rule, and offer non self-paced programs. VA reports annually on qualifications earned by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants. The VET TEC program measures the performance of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants by tracking program completion rates, job placement, and retention. While most participants pursue degrees, some opt for educational certificates or on-the-job training. VA approves non-degree programs for GI Bill purposes, including over 18,000 school locations and nearly 500 flight school locations. The VET TEC program offers non-degree programs approved for GI Bill purposes, with various school locations and apprenticeship opportunities available. Popular certificates include welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is for military personnel and their families, but oversight challenges have been identified in ensuring program quality. The 2018 VA OIG report highlighted limitations in SAA funding and oversight actions for institutions auditing. SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides food benefits to low-income households. States receive SNAP E&T funding for employment and education services, established by Congress in 1987. The purpose of SNAP E&T is to help SNAP participants gain skills for employment. States can choose to make their E&T programs mandatory or voluntary. Components of an E&T program include job search programs, workfare, education, and job retention programs. SNAP E&T funding includes various streams of mandatory funding, with nearly $124 million available without a state match. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS, in partnership with Seattle Jobs Initiative, has been operating SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project aimed at providing technical assistance and resources for more effective SNAP E&T programs. Integration between the WIOA Title I program and SNAP E&T is required by statutory provisions. The SNAP E&T program must be delivered through the statewide workforce development system, with services available at WIOA One-Stop centers. SNAP staff are experienced in addressing challenges like low basic skills and mental health issues. Educational activities provided by SNAP E&T programs include improving basic skills, job search abilities, high school equivalency programs, remedial education, and English as a second language instruction to enhance employability. The SNAP E&T program offers educational components to enhance employability, such as vocational training, basic education, apprenticeships, and work experience. Participants must meet work requirements and income eligibility to qualify for SNAP benefits. The SNAP E&T program requires participants to meet work requirements and income eligibility to qualify for benefits. Household income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level, with certain state options allowing up to 200%. General work requirements are in place, with non-disabled adults required to register for work and maintain at least 30 hours per week. States have flexibility in designing E&T programs and may make participation mandatory for certain populations. Assigning individuals to specific E&T programs varies, with state agencies assessing participants to determine the most effective components for them. The USDA guidance requires state agencies to assess participants for effective E&T programs. The 2018 farm bill now mandates case management services for all states. E&T funds cannot be used for TANF recipients, and some IHE students may be ineligible for SNAP. SNAP E&T covers educational program costs and associated expenses like dependent care. SNAP E&T funds cover education program costs, including dependent care and transportation. Funding is administered by state agencies and contracted programs, often through third-party partnerships like community colleges. Federal funds reimburse partners based on a 100% or 50% match, depending on the funding stream. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant as the first payer for college expenses, with E&T covering the remaining costs. Expenses supported by E&T must be reasonable and necessary. The SNAP E&T program covers education costs not covered by the Pell Grant, with expenses needing to be reasonable and necessary. Workforce partnerships were added to the program by the 2018 farm bill, allowing for training and work opportunities. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules and must consult with the state workforce development board or private employers. Programs vary in capacity and services offered, with requirements set by statute and regulation. The SNAP E&T program allows for education and workforce training opportunities, with states consulting with the state workforce development board or private employers. USDA has established performance indicators reporting, but has not yet published the information based on the reports. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after completion of participation in SNAP E&T. The SNAP E&T program includes education and workforce training opportunities, with states offering services other than education to participants. Some states provided an education component in their E&T program, serving almost 70,000 SNAP participants. However, fewer than 10% of participants receive education, and information on the quality of educational programs is lacking. Future guidance and policymaking may be informed by an evaluation on the 2014 farm bill pilot projects. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF is administered by HHS and is a mandatory spending program, allowing states to spend funds on various benefits, services, and activities. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant that provides monthly assistance to needy families with children, primarily single mothers. Funds can be used for various benefits, services, and activities, including subsidized employment, training, and education programs. Some states have used TANF funds to support career pathways, which offer education programs and support services to help individuals advance in their chosen career paths. The TANF program provides assistance to low-income families with children, offering support services, work-study jobs, and vocational education training. State eligibility rules vary, with a focus on parents or caretakers of children. TANF funds state assistance programs, with over one-third of recipients having less than a high school education. The TANF program, created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, provides funds to states for assistance programs for needy families with children. States determine eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and required activities for adult recipients. TANF also offers support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services. TANF funds support services like advising, career planning, and employment services at state and local levels. States decide which participants receive services, sometimes referring them to WIOA One Stop Centers. States may operate employment and training services separately from WIOA. There are no federal rules on program quality, but states may establish their own. The minimum work participation rate is TANF's main performance measure, requiring a percentage of recipients to be working or engaged in activities. Rules limit training and education, with vocational training capped at 12 months. States can meet the work participation rate in various ways. TANF recipients may face limitations in pursuing non-degree programs due to child care and educational preparation needs. The cash assistance caseload is predominantly single mothers with young children, and states can use TANF funds for child care assistance. Vocational training is limited to 12 months, potentially restricting the types of training available. Income eligibility thresholds may prevent individuals in apprenticeship programs from receiving assistance, and the quality of training and education programs is uncertain."
