    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for undocumented students by establishing Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Despite California's efforts to provide opportunities for undocumented youth, only 20% of high school graduates attend college. Many are unaware of policies like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA. Currently, most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. The creation of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions aims to streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting Assembly Bill 540 requirements. These centers provide support services, workshops, legal clinics, and peer mentoring to increase awareness of available resources and enhance professional development for undocumented students. Several college campuses, including UCLA, UC Davis, CSULA, CSUF, and CSUN, have already established these centers to empower and create a safe environment for this population. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging campuses to designate a Dream Resource Liaison to assist students meeting specific requirements by providing access to financial aid and academic opportunities. California Community Colleges and State Universities are encouraged to have a staff person designated as a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in available resources for all students, including undocumented students. The California State University campuses are encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements. The University of California is also encouraged to have a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services for students, and they can be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The California State University campuses and the University of California are encouraged to have Dream Resource Liaisons to assist students with financial aid and academic opportunities. Dream Resource Centers can provide support services and may be located within existing student service or academic centers. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California are authorized to accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided."
