    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act highlights key points. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the US Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for creators and promote the free flow of ideas and information. The copyright term is limited to ensure the public is not permanently deprived of the benefits of an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on this system. The public domain is essential for both commercial and noncommercial creators, as it provides raw material for new productions and educational purposes. Current copyright law protects works published as early as 1923, but older works are no longer commercially viable. The public domain is crucial for creators as it offers material for new productions and educational use. However, older works, although less commercially valuable, are still useful for historians, artists, and teachers. The existing copyright system hinders the public domain's purpose by preventing access to abandoned works with no commercial value. Establishing a mechanism for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain is necessary to prevent the public from being deprived of works with no commercial or copyright purpose. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS. The definition of \"United States work\" in section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended for sections 306 and 411. Changes are made to the duration of copyright for works created on or after January 1, 1978, and for works created but not published or copyrighted before that date. The amendment to section 304 of title 17, United States Code, involves changes to the duration of copyright for certain works, subject to section 306. The amendment to section 304 of title 17, United States Code, involves changes to the duration of copyright for certain works, subject to section 306. In paragraph (2), subparagraphs (A) and (B) are modified to exclude copyrights expiring under section 306. Additionally, subsection (b) is amended to clarify the application of the maintenance fee for published United States works. The maintenance fee for published United States works must be paid every 10 years to keep the copyright in force. If the fee is not paid within 6 months after the due date, the copyright will expire. Ancillary or promotional works related to the main work are also covered under this provision. The fee must be accompanied by a prescribed form and any additional material required by the Register of Copyrights. The registration provisions of sections 408 and 409 require a prescribed deposit, fee, and additional identifying material as per regulations. The Copyright Office fees are amended to include a maintenance fee for published United States works. The Register of Copyrights must establish procedures for easier submission and access to information under section 306 of title 17, United States Code."
