    "content": "Members of Congress have introduced legislation to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to allow the importation of FDA-approved drugs from lower-priced foreign sources. Senator Dorgan introduced S. 1232, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009, which aims to address rising concerns over prescription drug spending. The bill is similar to previous bills introduced in Congress and seeks to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs with safety measures. Current law and bills aim to balance availability of safe imported prescription drugs with reducing financial burden on U.S. consumers. Importing prescription drugs is illegal except for pharmacists and wholesalers under certain conditions. Secretaries have not certified importation programs due to safety and cost concerns. The MEDS Act of 2000 added importation provisions to the FFDCA, but Congress retained the certification requirement in the MMA. The Obama Administration is open to drug importation, with a proposal in the FY2010 budget. Current law does not allow individual importation, but the Secretary can permit it under certain conditions. FDA is working on policy options for drug importation. The FDA currently allows individuals to import a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use with written affirmation. S. 1232 aims to rewrite Section 804 to allow pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals to import prescription drugs with potential safety safeguards. S. 1232 aims to allow pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals to import prescription drugs with potential safety safeguards, including provisions to influence industry behavior for cost savings. The bill would require manufacturers to notify the HHS Secretary of any differences in imported drugs from FDA-approved versions for U.S. sale. S. 1232 would permit prescription drug importation from select countries, with safety measures in place to prevent adulterated or counterfeit drugs from entering the U.S. market. Exporters from permitted countries would need to comply with registration requirements. S. 1232 would require exporters and importers to register, implement a monitored chain of custody for drug shipments, and incorporate counterfeit-resistant technologies in packaging to ensure drug authenticity. Physical monitoring of facilities along the supply chain would also be mandated. The bill S. 1232 mandates the use of overt, optically variable, counterfeit-resistant technologies in the packaging of all prescription drugs, including blister packs, shrink wrap, labels, seals, bottles, and boxes. Exporters and importers must mark shipping containers for compliance, with anti-counterfeiting or track-and-trace technology. Internet pharmacies must provide detailed information on their website, including pharmacist credentials and contact information. Various restrictions are also included in the bill. The bill S. 1232 includes restrictions for Internet pharmacies, requiring valid U.S. prescriptions and a qualifying medical relationship with the patient. It addresses issues like prescription validity, disclosure information, and physician-patient contact requirements. S. 1232 also contains provisions to influence industry behavior and prohibits manufacturers from discriminatory practices. S. 1232 aims to prevent manufacturers from discriminating against exporters, importers, or distributors of imported prescription drugs by charging higher prices or restricting supplies. It also addresses the issue of drug differentiation for distribution in permitted countries versus the U.S. Enforcement would involve the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. Additionally, the bill seeks to reverse a recent court ruling that allowed drug manufacturers to block U.S. imports of their patented products. S. 1232 aims to reverse a court ruling that allowed drug manufacturers to block U.S. imports of their patented products. It introduces a new subsection in the Patent and Trademark Act to allow goods authorized for foreign sales by a U.S. patent holder to be imported into the U.S. without regard to the patent. The bill sets up a fee mechanism to fund the importation program, with fees covering all costs and limited to 2.5% of the total price of drugs imported. The bill, S. 1232, proposes a fee mechanism for importers and exporters based on their activity level. Fees collected would fund the administration of importation provisions. The Secretary has discretion to allow importation for personal use if it poses no unreasonable risk. The bill requires the Secretary to finalize importation rules within a year of enacting an interim rule. Importation of qualifying drugs can begin 90 days after enactment from registered exporters and permitted countries by registered importers. The bill, S. 1232, proposes a fee mechanism for importers and exporters based on their activity level to fund importation provisions. Importation of qualifying drugs can begin 90 days after enactment from registered exporters and permitted countries by registered importers. If any provision of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009 is held unconstitutional, the remainder of the act would not be affected. Several CRS reports cover legal issues surrounding prescription drug importation in greater depth."
