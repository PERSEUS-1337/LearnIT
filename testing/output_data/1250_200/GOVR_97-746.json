    "content": "The number of non-U.S. citizens enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities slowed after 9/11 due to visa policies and global competition. However, a 2009 report showed a significant 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the academic year 2008-2009, with a notable rise in students from China. New foreign student enrollment also increased by 16.0%, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. Differences in enrollment were seen based on institution type, study level, and disciplines, with varying trends based on students' regions of origin. Foreign student enrollment in the United States for the academic year 2008-2009 saw an increase of 8.0%, with notable contributions from India, China, and South Korea. The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, and physical sciences. Data from NSF shows that foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering in 2006. In 2006, foreign students (temporary and permanent resident status) earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering, with notable increases in physical sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various science and engineering fields, with increases in computer sciences, earth sciences, and social sciences. Specific data shows that a significant number of non-U.S. citizens receiving doctorate degrees were from China, India, Taiwan, Canada, Africa, Turkey, Japan, and Germany. Certain restrictions apply to foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions. Foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions, with temporary resident status, are required to be full-time students and are restricted from seeking employment. They can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Financial support comes from various sources including personal, university, foreign government, and employer. While ineligible for direct federal aid, they receive support through research and teaching assistantships funded by the university. Foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions, with temporary resident status, receive support through research and teaching assistantships funded by the university. The 2007 report shows that non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive more financial assistance from universities than U.S. doctoral recipients. A breakdown by race/ethnicity reveals varying levels of self-financing among different groups. In the physical sciences, universities provide primary support for a majority of temporary resident students. In the physical sciences, universities primarily support temporary resident students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. Foreign doctoral students receive more financial assistance from universities than U.S. students in various disciplines. Foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs benefit U.S. universities by increasing skilled workers in the labor force, contributing to the workforce at institutions, and providing tuition revenue. Foreign students pay tuition, which is a significant source of income for educational institutions. Minority communities argue that there is a disparity in access to graduate education, scholarships, research funds, and collaborations for U.S. minorities compared to foreign students. Former professor Frank L. Morris accused colleges of favoring foreign students over minorities in terms of resources and opportunities. Morris criticized the generous immigration policy and disproportionate funding for foreign doctoral students over American minority students, particularly African American doctoral students. This has hindered the economic well-being of the African American community by providing inadequate training for the technologically-driven U.S. economy. Criticisms also include communication issues with foreign teaching assistants and the impact of accented English on the learning process. Some states have implemented English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants. Several states have set English-language standards for foreign students serving as teaching assistants to demonstrate proficiency in English. Some academics and scientists see scientific migration as a net gain, enabling the U.S. economy to stay at the forefront of science and technology. International graduate students and scholars play a crucial role in research activities, with their presence being essential for research and teaching in various sectors. The number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the U.S. remained stable in the 1980s but saw a significant increase in 1992. In 1992, there was a notable increase in the admissions of immigrant scientists and engineers in the United States, driven by changes in immigration laws. The number of scientists and engineers on permanent visas rose to 23,534 by 1993, with further increases due to legislative changes. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force reached a peak in 2000, reflecting high levels of entry during the 1990s. Administrative changes, immigration legislation, and the aftermath of September 11th have influenced the issuance of permanent visas in recent years. The H-1B program has also seen an increase in annual quotas for foreign-born workers. The H-1B program allows foreign-born workers to obtain visas to work in the U.S. for up to six years. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has led to decreased job opportunities and wages for U.S. workers. The program has been used by companies to fill positions not considered temporary, leading to concerns about over-reliance on H-1B visa workers in high-tech positions. Some in the scientific and technical community believe that an over-reliance on H-1B visa workers has weakened opportunities for U.S. workers. Critics argue that foreign labor is hired at lower salaries, displacing American workers. Advocates of the H-1B program argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions, even during slow economic growth. The Government Accountability Office found that Labor's review of H-1B applications does not consistently identify all inaccuracies. The Wage and Hour Division enforces H-1B program requirements by investigating complaints against employers. USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, hindering investigations. Justice pursues charges of discriminatory hiring practices but has not found significant misconduct. Concerns exist about lower salaries for foreign computer professionals compared to U.S. counterparts. The hiring of H-1B workers is a contentious issue, with concerns about lower salaries for foreign computer professionals compared to their U.S. counterparts. The Department of Labor enforces policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas. Many believe that the U.S. needs foreign talent to compete in the global economy, but there are calls for stricter monitoring of their entry into colleges and universities. Some argue that the lack of native-born students entering scientific fields is a more pressing issue than the presence of foreign-born students. The debate on foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs intensified after 9/11. There are concerns about the need to attract more native-born students to STEM fields, as relying solely on foreign talent may not be sustainable. The presence of foreign students is seen as essential but should complement, not replace, domestic talent. The United States is facing challenges in attracting international students, with concerns about access to sensitive areas and research. There is debate about the impact of stricter requirements on enrollments in colleges and universities, as well as potential negative effects on U.S. industry competitiveness. Tracking foreign students attending U.S. institutions is a key issue. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act authorized the SEVP/CIPRIS program to track foreign students in the US, but it was never fully implemented due to cost concerns and opposition from universities. The USA Patriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act enhanced data collection on foreign students in U.S. institutions. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was developed to track foreign students and ensure visa compliance. However, SEVIS faced delays and issues with visa processing due to more rigorous screening of applicants. The existing problems with SEVIS are technical and personnel-related, causing delays in visa processing. A proposal for SEVIS II aims to enhance the tracking system and address security issues. A hearing in 2005 focused on strengthening the visa process for antiterrorism measures while facilitating legitimate travel. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads, lack of resources, training, and data availability. The visa-processing offices lack strategic direction, resources, and training, with unreliable data hindering security and visa fraud detection. Clear procedures for visa issuance and monitoring are crucial for consistent adjudication. The Government Accountability Office has highlighted improvements in visa processing but identified ongoing issues that need immediate attention, such as clarifying policies and ensuring consular officers have necessary resources. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation, including H.R. 4321, aims to clarify visa policies, improve national security, and exempt U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based limits. Other bills focus on attracting foreign students in scientific disciplines while protecting American interests. Several bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress to attract foreign students in scientific and technical fields while safeguarding American interests. H.R. 1736, the International Science and Technology Cooperation Act, addresses issues impacting collaboration between U.S. and foreign scientists. S. 887, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, aims to limit the number of H-1B and L-1 employees that large U.S. employers can hire. H.R. 1791, the STAPLE Act, proposes numerical limitations on immigrants with U.S. doctorates in scientific fields and offers of employment in related fields. The STAPLE Act proposes H-1B visa numerical limitations for immigrants with U.S. doctorates in scientific fields, requiring education as a condition of employment."
