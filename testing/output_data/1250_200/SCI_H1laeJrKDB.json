To address limitations in control and understanding of these models, recent research focuses on studying the semantics of the latent space. This paper introduces a method to enhance interpretability by identifying meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over image properties like object position and scale. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for simple image transformations. It has been successfully applied to GANs and variational auto-encoders. Recent research focuses on studying the semantics of the latent space in deep generative models to enhance interpretability and control over image properties. This method allows for precise control over object position and scale in generated images, benefiting applications like image in-painting and dataset-synthesis. The study of the latent space structure provides insights into generative models' capabilities for unsupervised data representations. Generative models are powerful tools for learning unsupervised data representations. Latent spaces in auto-encoders exhibit a vector space structure encoding factors of variations like object presence, position, and lighting. Factors of variations can be modal (discrete values) or continuous (range of values), efficiently representing natural images. Describing images using factors of variations is a common approach, enhancing interpretability and control over image properties. In this paper, the authors propose a method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in images. The method does not require labeled data or an encoder model. It is tested on three factors of variation: vertical position, horizontal position, and scale of objects in images. This approach enhances interpretability and control over image properties beyond semantic attributes like gender or emotion. The method proposed in the paper allows for finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, enabling precise control over continuous factors of variations in generated images. It focuses on position and scale as measurable quantities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method both qualitatively and quantitatively. Key contributions include the ability to control image properties by sampling latent representations along linear directions, a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models, and insights into the challenges of inverting generative models through optimization. The text discusses the challenges of inverting generative models with optimization, focusing on the impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models. It highlights the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining labels, emphasizing the ability to determine latent codes for transformations in the latent space. The text discusses the challenges of inverting generative models with optimization, focusing on the impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models. It highlights the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining labels, emphasizing the ability to determine latent codes for transformations in the latent space. In the context of image translation, the goal is to find the latent code that minimizes reconstruction error, with choices like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or cross-entropy, to avoid producing blurry images. The text discusses the challenges of using pixel-wise losses like MSE and cross-entropy in generative models, which can lead to blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed, but they are computationally expensive. The poor performance of MSE is attributed to its favoring of expected values, limiting the generator's ability to produce diverse texture patterns. The text proposes studying the effect of MSE on images in the frequency domain to understand why textures are reconstructed as uniform regions. In the Fourier domain, the text proposes reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function to generate sharper images with more details and realistic textures. This approach allows for a wider range of possibilities for the generated images. A comparison to other losses using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) is also provided. In the Fourier domain, the text suggests reducing high frequency weight in the loss function for sharper, detailed images with realistic textures. Comparison to other losses is done using Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) is addressed, with a dataset of trajectories in latent space corresponding to a transformation T in pixel space. The transformation is parametrized by \u03b4t controlling the degree of transformation. In practice, the optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) is challenging due to slow convergence and the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space. To address this, the transformation T T is decomposed into smaller transformations and solved sequentially to guide optimization on the manifold. This approach improves convergence compared to previous methods. Our approach decomposes the transformation into smaller steps, solving sequentially to guide optimization on the image manifold. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require extra training and can be used directly. We address challenges such as undefined regions in transformed images and outliers by discarding latent codes with high reconstruction errors. To reduce outliers, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors in generated trajectories. Algorithm 1 is used to create trajectories in the latent space. A model is then defined to encode factors of variations in the latent space, predicting parameters from the latent code coordinates along an axis. The dSprite dataset involves horizontal position x and axis projection z following specific distributions. A parametrized model g \u03b8 is used with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u) to estimate u and \u03b8 by minimizing MSE between \u03b4t and f (\u03b8,u) using gradient descent. This method helps estimate the distribution of generated images. The curr_chunk discusses the application of gradient descent on a dataset produced by Algorithm 1 for a given transformation. It highlights the estimation of image distribution generated by a model and the control over sampling images. Experiments were conducted on two datasets, dSprites and ILSVRC, to study disentanglement and potential bias in training datasets. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation details of experiments using TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model on the ILSVRC dataset. The BigGAN model takes two vectors as inputs to generate images from different categories. Several \u03b2-VAEs were also trained to study the importance of disentanglement in image generation. The \u03b2-VAE architecture used in the experiments was trained on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. The evaluation focused on factors of variation like position and scale, using saliency detection for natural images from the BigGAN model. The scale was assessed by the proportion of salient pixels, and the evaluation procedure involved sampling latent codes and generating images to estimate the real value of the factors. The study focused on evaluating factors of variation using a \u03b2-VAE architecture trained on dSprites. Latent codes were sampled to generate images for assessing position and scale control. Results showed precise control over object position and scale for selected ILSVRC categories. The study merged datasets to analyze shared directions across categories. Results showed spatial factors are mainly encoded in the first part of the latent code. The contribution of level 5 is higher for y position compared to x position and scale. The study analyzed spatial factors encoded in the latent code, with a focus on y position having a higher contribution than x position and scale. Results on ILSVRC dataset showed performance variations with geometric transformations, suggesting correlations between object position and background affect algorithm performance. Testing disentanglement effect on method performance, \u03b2-VAE models were trained on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Our method trained \u03b2-VAE models on dSprites with varying \u03b2 values, showing that higher \u03b2 values lead to more disentangled latent spaces. Results in Figure 5 demonstrate precise control over image object position by moving in the latent space. The effectiveness of the method improves with increased disentanglement, as seen in the decreasing standard deviation with higher \u03b2 values. This highlights the importance of disentangled representations for controlling the generative process in models like GANs and auto-encoders. Our method does not require labels and shows that it is possible to find meaningful directions in generative models without explicit control mechanisms like conditional GANs or VAE. InfoGan has demonstrated that adding a code to the input of the GAN generator can disentangle the latent space, but our approach achieves similar results without the need for explicit regularization terms. Our approach focuses on disentangling the latent space in generative models without the need for explicit control mechanisms. Unlike previous works that analyze network activations, we concentrate on finding latent representations without an encoder. Previous studies have shown that inverting the generator of a GAN can be achieved by optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction errors. The inversion process involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error in generative models. Previous methods have shown limitations on complex datasets like ILSVRC. A new reconstruction loss in Section 2.1.1 improves reconstruction quality significantly. White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in latent space arithmetic. Additionally, a new algorithmic data augmentation technique called \"synthetic attribute\" aims to generate less blurry images with a VAE. Recent works on ArXiv focus on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. Recent papers on ArXiv highlight the importance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, particularly in controlling their output. While similar to other methods in using transformations and linear trajectories in the latent space, the authors' approach differs in training procedures and evaluation methods. They generate a dataset of trajectories for training and use a saliency model for evaluation, allowing for performance measurement across various categories. The study also explores the control of auto-encoders, the impact of disentangled representations, and proposes an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators. The study focuses on the impact of disentangled representations on the control and structure of the latent space of BigGAN. A new reconstruction error is proposed for inverting generators, allowing for more precise control over the generative process. The authors aim to extract meaningful directions in the latent space to control properties of generated images, such as translation and scale. This work is a step towards understanding the representations learned by generative models. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. It introduces a new reconstruction error for inverting generators, leading to smoother images with less high frequencies. The optimization process favors images with smaller magnitudes in high frequencies, promoting a more controlled generative process. The \u03b2-VAE architecture was designed to generate images of size 64x64 using a simple convolutional VAE architecture. The decoder network consists of transposed convolutions and dense layers. The framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision, promoting a controlled generative process. The study evaluates the reconstruction results of their method with different values of \u03c3, showing good results with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5. A comparison with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) is also presented, highlighting the accuracy of their approach in avoiding artifacts. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation was performed on 1000 images from the ILSVRC dataset, showing promising results with the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric. The reconstruction results using the method were evaluated with different values of \u03c3, showing good performance with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5. The Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric indicated that images reconstructed with the method were closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The optimization problem of Equation 2 is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold, especially for transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations in pixel space is curved, as shown with images from the dSprites dataset. The dSprites dataset shows progressive transformations of images, visualized through PCA trajectories. Large translations, rotations, and scales cause issues as the shortest path in pixel-space is orthogonal to the manifold. This poses a problem during optimization of the latent code, where gradients become small when near orthogonality occurs. In an ideal scenario, the descent direction in pixel space should align with the generative model's manifold. The direction of descent in pixel space should align with the generative model's manifold to avoid slowing down optimization. An example with an ideal GAN generating a circle illustrates how orthogonal gradients can halt progress. Additional qualitative examples show results for geometric transformations and brightness changes using the BigGAN model. The BigGAN model generates images with variations in position, scale, and brightness. Latent codes are sampled by adding a learned direction. Some categories may have uncontrolled brightness due to lack of training data. Direction is learned for position and scale on ten categories, while brightness is learned on the top five categories."
