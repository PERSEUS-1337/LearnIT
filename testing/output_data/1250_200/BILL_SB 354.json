    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code is required for administration. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those specified in the California Constitution and federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. Additionally, the article does not apply to public employees protected under federal law until a court ruling or January 1, 2016. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those specified in the California Constitution and federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. The benefit plan required by this article applies to new public employees as defined in Section 7522.04. The benefit plan required by this article applies to new public employees who are defined as new members in Section 7522.04. Individuals who were employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then became employed by a subsequent public employer on or after that date, will be subject to the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity established within the previous six months. Any agreement for reciprocity between public retirement systems and individuals changing employment positions before January 1, 2013, will be subject to the defined benefit plan of the new employer's retirement system. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower cost formula before January 1, 2013, they can continue using that formula. However, if they adopt a new formula after that date, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after that date, it must meet specific requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the existing defined contribution plan or an approved plan. The Cities of Brea and Fullerton may form a joint powers authority to provide employees with a defined benefit plan. Other cities in Orange County may join the authority, but no more than three cities are allowed. The formation of a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, must not exempt new employees or members from the requirements of the article. New members can only participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is not required to adopt certain benefit formulas or compensation limitations. This article does not provide membership in a public retirement system for individuals ineligible under the system's rules. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
