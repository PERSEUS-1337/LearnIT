    "content": "The \"Community-Based Independence for Seniors Act\" emphasizes the importance of community-based services in maintaining the health and independence of seniors. Without these services, seniors may face negative health outcomes and loss of independence, leading to reliance on Medicaid for long-term care expenses. Targeting community-based services to at-risk seniors can help prevent asset depletion and Medicaid dependency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program to prevent institutionalization among low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Up to 5 eligible MA plans can enroll 1,000 beneficiaries each in the program, using rebates to provide supplemental benefits. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program aims to provide supplemental benefits to low-income Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in eligible MA plans, including long-term care services like homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, adult day care services, and non-Medicare-covered equipment. Eligible MA plans must have experience in offering special needs plans for nursing home-eligible, non-institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries living in the community. The eligibility criteria for participating in the Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program include experience in offering special needs plans for nursing home-eligible, non-institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries in the community, working with low-income beneficiaries, having a service area in a State that provides necessary Medicaid data, and meeting other criteria set by the Secretary. Eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries are defined as individuals who are Medicare Advantage eligible, subsidy eligible, and not eligible for benefits under title XIX. The eligibility criteria for the Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program include being age 65 or older, not eligible for Medicaid benefits, unable to perform daily living activities, and not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Eligible beneficiaries can make changes outside of the annual election periods. The CBI-SNP demonstration program allows eligible Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in a participating MA plan, with education provided by the Secretary through various organizations. The program will run for 5 years starting January 1, 2018, with budget neutrality ensured by the Secretary. The CBI-SNP demonstration program may be expanded nationwide under the Social Security Act, with an independent evaluation required. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be evaluated by an independent third party to determine its impact on patient care, hospitalizations, Medicaid admissions, spend down of income/assets, and quality of life. The evaluation criteria will include specific goals, hypotheses, and data collection requirements. Reports must be submitted by January 1, 2022. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2022, containing the evaluation results of the CBI-SNP demonstration program and recommendations for legislative or administrative action. Funding of $3,000,000 will be transferred for program implementation from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary will transfer funding for program implementation from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. An additional amount will be transferred for evaluation and reporting purposes. The transferred amounts will remain available until expended. The Paperwork Reduction Act will not apply to the testing and evaluation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program."
