    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017\" or the \"MEMA Act of 2017\". It includes a National Flood Mapping Program. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 is amended to include partnering with other agencies and private entities to meet program objectives and incorporating building-specific flood risk information. The Administrator, in coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, will establish a digital display environment for flood hazard risk information within 5 years of the Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017. This will involve partnering with states and communities to adopt successful approaches and technologies. The Administrator will create a digital display for flood hazard risk information by adopting successful approaches and technologies from states and communities. This display will include special flood hazard areas, base flood elevations, and structure-specific flood risk information for each property address. The Administrator will provide digital flood hazard risk information for each property address, including elevation data, current elevation certificate, letter of map changes, risk premium rate, and required disclosures. The Insurance Act of 1968 requires an explanation of the difference between chargeable premium rates and full risk premium rates for properties, along with the methodology used. It also includes the estimated cost to repair structures damaged by floods with different recurrence intervals. The Insurance Act of 1968 mandates the explanation of chargeable premium rates versus full risk premium rates for properties, including repair costs for flood-damaged structures at varying recurrence intervals. Additionally, it requires the assessment of structure mitigation cost-effectiveness, premium rate adjustments, and claims history privacy restrictions for the database. The Administrator is required to develop a spatial database of buildings in the national flood insurance program, including footprints, elevations, elevation certificates, parcel, address, and imagery data. The Administrator is tasked with collecting necessary data for flood hazard identification and reduction, including elevation certificates, parcel, address, and imagery data, flood insurance rate maps, and any other data deemed necessary. Data procurement may involve directing communities to provide information, such as elevation data, for structures obtaining permits. The Administrator collects elevation data for structures in flood hazard areas, issues guidelines, partners with stakeholders for data sharing, and contracts for new LiDAR data. A one-time premium credit of up to $500 is provided for purchasing an elevation certificate. Coordination for mass letters of map change is also conducted. The Administrator offers a one-time premium credit of up to $500 for purchasing an elevation certificate. Guidelines are issued for LiDAR-based letter of map amendment approaches. An annual progress report on the implementation of this subsection is required. Reimbursement authority is added to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow reimbursement for State or local agencies assisting the Administrator in flood risk analysis and mapping, if they comply with established standards and guidance documents."
