    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the possession of weapons of mass destruction by hostile states or terrorist groups poses the greatest threat to national security. It is a top priority to protect the US and its allies from such attacks. The US policy is to ensure compliance with nuclear non-proliferation and chemical weapons treaties. The United States has been well-served by various international treaties and agreements related to the prohibition and control of weapons of mass destruction, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, IAEA safeguards system, and control lists of various export control regimes. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, established by various acts, has achieved significant milestones in nuclear disarmament, including deactivating warheads, destroying missiles, silos, launchers, bombers, and air-to-surface missiles.

Bush called for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to prevent weapons and dangerous materials from falling into the wrong hands. The program helps former Soviet states find employment for weapons scientists and dismantles, destroys, and secures weapons and materials.
