    "content": "The \"Crackdown on Deadbeat Dealers Act of 2002\" aims to address the issue of a small number of licensed firearms dealers contributing significantly to crime guns. In 1998, a small percentage of dealers accounted for over half of crime guns traced to them. The Act proposes increasing compliance inspections of firearms dealers and imposing harsher penalties on gun kingpins. Section 923(g)(1)(B)(ii)(I) of title 18, United States Code is amended to increase penalties for gun kingpins. The penalty for engaging in an illegal firearms business under Section 924(a)(2) is now a fine, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. The Sentencing Commission will review and amend sentencing guidelines for violations of section 922(a)(1) accordingly. SEC. 5 amends Section 924(a)(3) of title 18, imposing fines and imprisonment for serious recordkeeping offenses related to gun trafficking. SEC. 6 introduces suspension of firearms dealer's license and civil penalties for violations of the Gun Control Act. Subsections (e) and (f) of section 923 of title 18, United States Code, allow the Secretary to suspend or revoke a license or impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for willful violations of gun laws or failure to provide secure gun storage. The Secretary can also penalize dealers who transfer armor-piercing ammunition.

Upon request, the Secretary will promptly hold a hearing to review denial, suspension, revocation, or assessment of a license. The Secretary can stay the suspension or revocation upon request.

The court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties, regardless of whether it was presented at the hearing. If the court finds that the Secretary acted without authority in denying, suspending, or revoking a license, they will order the Secretary to comply with the court's decision. SEC. 7. TERMINATION OF FIREARMS DEALER'S LICENSE UPON FELONY CONVICTION. Amends Section 925(b) of title 18, United States Code, to change the wording regarding the termination of a firearms dealer's license upon felony conviction."
