    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" and extends the publicly traded partnership ownership structure to energy power generation projects, transportation fuels, and related energy activities. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act amends section 7704(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from minerals, natural resources, renewable energy, and electric power generation exclusively utilizing specified resources or energy property. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands the types of resources eligible for income and gains under the Internal Revenue Code, including renewable energy, electric power generation, and thermal energy storage. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act broadens the scope of eligible resources for income and gains under the Internal Revenue Code, including renewable energy, electric power generation, and thermal energy storage, waste heat to power, renewable fuel infrastructure, and renewable fuels. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands eligible resources for income and gains under the Internal Revenue Code to include renewable fuels, renewable chemicals, energy efficient buildings, and gasification with sequestration. Gasification with sequestration involves producing products or generating electric power from a project that meets specific requirements and separates and stores at least 75% of qualified carbon dioxide. Carbon capture and sequestration includes generating or storing electric power from power generation facilities. The text chunk discusses the requirements for capturing and disposing of qualified carbon dioxide from power generation facilities or units placed in service after January 8, 2013. The captured carbon dioxide must be stored in secure geological storage to qualify under section 45Q. The text chunk outlines the criteria for capturing and disposing of qualified carbon dioxide from power generation facilities or units placed in service before January 9, 2013. The captured carbon dioxide must be stored in secure geological storage to meet the requirements of section 45Q. The text discusses the sale of goods or services from qualified facilities under section 45Q(c) where captured carbon dioxide is disposed of in secure geological storage. Additionally, it defines qualifying renewable chemicals produced in the United States or its territories. The text discusses the production and use of biobased products with a high biobased content of 95 percent or higher, for the production of chemical products, polymers, plastics, or formulated products. The text discusses biobased products with a high biobased content used for the production of chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products, including various specific substances like acetic acid, acrylic acid, and polylactic acid. The text discusses biobased products with a high biobased content used for the production of chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products, including specific substances like isoprene, itaconic acid, ketals, levulinic acid, olefins, polyhydroxyalkonate, polylactic acid, polyitaconic acid, polyols from vegetable oils, poly(xylitan levulinate ketal), 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, succinic acid, terpenes, thiols, or p-Xylene, or any chemical listed by the Secretary for this purpose. The biobased content percentage is determined by testing representative samples using ASTM D6866. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to consider applications for listing chemicals under section 7874(d)(6)(A)(vi)(II). The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of the Act."
