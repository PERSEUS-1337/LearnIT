The Act aims to protect and enhance the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Clark County, Nevada. The Congress finds Red Rock as a significant natural resource that must be protected and enhanced for future generations. The Corporation owns land on Red Rock's eastern boundary and is developing a master-planned community, including 1,071 acres of high-ground lands that should be included in Red Rock for preservation. The Corporation has volunteered to forgo development of high-ground lands in Red Rock and proposes that the United States acquire title to preserve them. The purposes of this Act include exchanging lands to protect and expand Red Rock, as well as fulfilling the goals of previous conservation acts. SEC. 4. RED ROCK LAND EXCHANGE. The Corporation offers approximately 1,082 acres of nonfederal land to the United States for incorporation into the NCA. In exchange, the Corporation will receive approximately 998 acres of Federal lands, and Clark County, Nevada will receive approximately 1,221 acres of Federal lands for a park. The conveyances of private and Federal properties will occur simultaneously. The Red Rock Map will be kept on file for public inspection in Nevada. The Bureau of Land Management in Nevada and Reno, Nevada have documents available for public inspection. Conditions for conveyance include hazardous materials removal responsibility, a survey within 90 days, and specific requirements for lands conveyed to Clark County.

If the County tries to transfer or use the lands inconsistently, they will revert to the United States. SEC. 5. STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF LANDS.
