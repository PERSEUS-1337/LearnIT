    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act\". Congress acknowledges the substantial volume of electronic devices in the United States, with over 2 billion sold since 1980. Only 15 to 20 percent of discarded devices are recycled, despite the potential to recover valuable materials. Challenges remain in recycling electronic devices due to cost and proper material separation. The challenges of electronic device recycling include costly material separation, exporting devices to developing countries with crude recycling methods, and the need to improve logistics, technology, and consumer education to increase recyclability. Responsible electronic device recycling can help communities and industries develop programs to increase participation. Developing tools and technologies to extend device lifespan and promote safe reuse would reduce environmental impact and improve recyclability. Accurately assessing environmental impacts of device production and recycling is complex, but better data and methods would help determine optimal end-of-life management options. The Electronic Device Engineering Research, Development, and Demonstration Projects are aimed at improving device lifespan, promoting safe reuse, and reducing environmental impact. The Administrator will award multiyear grants to consortia for research on managing environmental impacts of electronic devices and developing innovative approaches. This research aims to enhance device collection and recycling efficiency, explore new uses for recovered materials, create eco-friendly alternatives to hazardous materials, and improve methods for handling and disposing of such materials safely. Additionally, it will focus on redesigning products for easier disassembly and recycling. The consortium will conduct lifecycle analyses of electronic devices, develop tools for assessing environmental impacts, design products for easier refurbishment and recycling, extend device lifecycles, and address barriers to recycling and reuse. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition. Grants for research projects on electronic device recycling will be awarded based on merit and competition. Consortiums must submit applications describing the research project, its relevance to reducing impediments in the recycling industry, potential for industry implementation, and promotion of collaboration among scientists and engineers from various disciplines. Research results will be publicly disseminated. Research results from electronic device recycling projects will be made publicly available through various channels such as best practices development, conference dissemination, EPA website publication, demonstration projects, and educational materials. For-profit consortium members must contribute at least 10% of the total project cost. Proprietary information will be protected by the Administrator. The Administrator will protect proprietary information and trade secrets provided by consortium members. A biennial report to Congress will list grants awarded, consortium entities, and research projects conducted under the Act. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2011\n- $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2012\n\nThis section outlines the funding authorized for the Administrator to carry out the Act, with specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year. The National Academy of Sciences will report on electronic device recycling. The Administrator will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to report on opportunities and barriers for increasing electronic device recyclability and safety within one year of the Act's enactment. This includes addressing recycling, reuse, and reducing hazardous materials in electronic devices to mitigate environmental and health risks. The report will identify gaps in current research and training programs for electronic device recycling, recommend areas for additional research resources, and address regulatory barriers to implementing best practices and technological innovations. SEC. 5. ENGINEERING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Administrator will award grants to higher education institutions to develop curricula incorporating environmental design principles into electronic device development for training students and professionals in the industry. Outreach will be conducted to minority serving institutions for grant information and application assistance. Grants awarded under this section will enhance engineering curriculum by incorporating environmental design principles for electronic devices. Activities include developing multidisciplinary curriculum, creating research opportunities, establishing certificate programs, and designing short courses for continuing education. The institution of higher education can apply for grants to enhance engineering curriculum by incorporating environmental design principles for electronic devices. The grants aim to fund activities such as developing multidisciplinary curriculum, creating research opportunities, establishing certificate programs, and designing short courses for continuing education. Authorized appropriations for this program include $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $5,150,000 for fiscal year 2011, and $5,304,000 for fiscal year 2012. The Director will establish a physical property database for environmentally friendly alternative materials in electronic devices. A strategic plan will be developed with industry input to prioritize and characterize these materials. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2010-2012. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Consortium, Director, Electronic device, and Institution of higher education. The Director will create a database for eco-friendly materials in electronic devices with industry input. $3,000,000 is allocated for fiscal years 2010-2012. The Act defines key terms related to electronic devices and institutions of higher education, including minority serving institutions. The Act defining key terms related to electronic devices and institutions of higher education, including minority serving institutions, was passed by the House of Representatives on April 22, 2009."
