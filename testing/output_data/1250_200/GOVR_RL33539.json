    "content": "Intelligence officials and Congress are discussing reducing intelligence spending while maintaining core capabilities. DNI James R. Clapper Jr. warned that sequestration could lead to a 7% cut, or $4 billion, in the National Intelligence Program budget, resulting in reduced global coverage and intelligence collection. He also highlighted the negative impact of past budget cuts in the 1990s, which distorted the intelligence workforce. Congress passed the FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation in December 2012, with the final bill signed into law in January 2013. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 created a Director of National Intelligence to oversee the intelligence community and advise the President. This was in response to the increased intelligence threats following the 9/11 attacks. The FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation was passed in December 2012 and signed into law in January 2013. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence to improve coordination and oversight of the intelligence community. This was a response to the 9/11 Commission's findings of inadequate coordination and inefficiencies in the intelligence community. The Act granted the DNI authority over budgeting and management of intelligence collection systems, addressing key issues raised by the Commission. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence to improve coordination and oversight of the intelligence community, in response to the 9/11 Commission's findings. The Act granted the DNI authority over budgeting and management of intelligence collection systems. The intelligence community includes various agencies such as the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, and branches of the military. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and various other intelligence offices/agencies are components of Cabinet departments with different roles and missions. The CIA remains the key analytic entity in the intelligence community, with all-source analytical capabilities covering global topics of interest to national security policymakers. It also conducts intelligence collection and covert actions as directed by the President. The CIA collects intelligence through human sources and conducts covert actions as directed by the President. The National Security Agency (NSA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) are major intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense. NSA focuses on signals intelligence, NRO operates reconnaissance satellites, and NGA provides geospatial data for military operations. Additionally, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is responsible for defense attach\u00e9s and analytical products for the DOD. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is responsible for defense attach\u00e9s and analytical products for the DOD, serving as the premier all-source analytic unit. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is known for high-quality analysis, focusing strictly on analytical functions. The FBI's key intelligence functions are in counterterrorism and counterintelligence, with a significant emphasis on preventing subordination of intelligence efforts to law enforcement. The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296) established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to fuse law enforcement and intelligence information for counterterrorism efforts. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis collaborates with other agencies to ensure state and local law enforcement receive intelligence on terrorist threats. The Coast Guard, under DHS, focuses on maritime security and homeland defense. The Energy Department also plays a role in analyzing intelligence information. The Coast Guard, now part of the DHS, deals with maritime security and homeland defense. The Energy Department analyzes foreign nuclear weapons programs, nonproliferation, and energy-security issues, with a focus on counterintelligence efforts. The Treasury Department collects information affecting U.S. fiscal policies and covers terrorist financing. Intelligence authorization bills provided guidance to intelligence agencies from FY1979 to FY2005, with a gap until October 2010. Annual intelligence authorization acts began in 1978, authorizing intelligence activities and providing detailed guidance to agencies. The absence of intelligence authorization acts led to key intelligence issues being addressed in defense authorization acts and defense appropriations acts. Congress passed three Intelligence Authorization bills for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, focusing on Director of National Intelligence authorities, Government Accountability Office audit authority, and measures to combat national security leaks. These bills reflect a determination to address intelligence priorities and wasteful spending estimates. The Intelligence Authorization bills for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 focus on Director of National Intelligence authorities, Government Accountability Office audit authority, and combating national security leaks. The DNI is tasked with eliminating waste and duplication in the intelligence community, but some believe this responsibility has been neglected, leading to redundancy in intelligence organizations. In counterterrorism, multiple intelligence organizations work to identify and disrupt terror plots, ensuring due diligence on threat reporting. Redundancy in warning systems and competitive analysis help prevent analytic biases and single points of failure. Maintaining a balance between eliminating unnecessary redundancy and fostering competition has been effective in preventing large-scale attacks like 9/11. The 113th Congress faces the challenge of balancing information sharing in intelligence to prevent large-scale attacks like 9/11. Reforms such as the USA Patriot Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 have improved information sharing within the intelligence community. Intelligence successes and failures show progress in this area, as seen in the review of the 2009 Christmas day bombing attempt. Significant improvement in information sharing has been noted in recent years. Reviews of incidents like the 2009 Christmas day bombing attempt and the 2012 Benghazi attack found that intelligence was effectively shared between agencies. Despite some remaining challenges, the main issue now is information overload rather than a lack of sharing. Analysts must now sift through large volumes of data to connect relevant points. The challenge in the intelligence community is connecting vast amounts of data to identify key information. Analysts struggle to sift through terabytes of intelligence daily, hindering their ability to connect the dots and prevent incidents like the Christmas day bombing attempt and the Fort Hood shooting. The fusion of domestic and foreign intelligence, along with new technologies generating massive data, has exacerbated this issue. Congress may need to review changes made by the intelligence community to address this problem. The House Intelligence Committee highlighted the integration of intelligence into military operations in 1997. The Persian Gulf War underscored the importance of intelligence from tactical and national systems. Technical challenges in data transmission have been addressed with congressional support. Intelligence played a crucial role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and subsequent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. A 2012 report by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board noted the CIA's support in counterterrorism efforts over the past decade. The 2012 report by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board found that the CIA and intelligence community have become too focused on tactical operations and military support, potentially neglecting their traditional functions of gathering and analyzing intelligence on strategic topics. Concerns were raised during confirmation hearings for CIA Director Brennan, who plans to review the CIA's mission allocation. Some argue that the emphasis on counterterrorism and operational support may be more about public perception than actual resource allocation. Intelligence agencies collect vast amounts of information daily, with mechanisms in place to ensure proper allocation of resources. Intelligence agencies collect vast amounts of information daily, with a focus on locating fixed installations and moving targets. The emergence of international terrorist threats has challenged traditional intelligence gathering methods, leading to a call for increased emphasis and resources on human intelligence capabilities. The National Clandestine Service was established at CIA in October 2005 to manage humint operations and coordinate efforts by other intelligence agencies. Congressional concerns exist regarding major technical systems, such as reconnaissance satellites, with significant budgetary implications. Intelligence agencies and their targets now heavily rely on commercial technologies, including encryption systems. There is ongoing debate on acquisition programs for new satellites, with the ultimate goal of providing accurate analysis in a timely manner. The performance of the intelligence community's analytical offices in the past decade is a subject of discussion, with some pointing out failures in preparing accurate assessments and estimates. The performance of the intelligence community's analytical offices in the past decade is debated, with some highlighting high quality analysis while others point to failures like the 9/11 attacks and flawed Iraqi weapons estimate. Congressional concerns include weaknesses in analysis, lack of language skills, and a focus on current intelligence over strategic analysis. Funding has increased post-9/11, and the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 aims to improve analysis through provisions like red team analyses and ensuring timely, objective, and independent intelligence products. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 aims to improve analysis through provisions like red team analyses and ensuring timely, objective, and independent intelligence products. Efforts to train analysts have been affected by long lead times, and the quality of intelligence analysis may be tested by emerging national security challenges. Oversight of the implementation of the Act remains a concern for Congress. The 113th Congress will continue to oversee the implementation of the Intelligence Reform Act, monitoring the relationship between the DNI and CIA Director. Congressional interest will focus on the effectiveness of post-9/11 intelligence elements like the FBI and DHS Intelligence & Analysis. Future satellite procurement programs, unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and efforts to prevent such disclosures will also be key areas of concern. The committee called on the executive branch to investigate and prosecute those responsible for targeted killings. The CIA's role in such actions may face scrutiny as the government seeks transparency. The Benghazi attack in 2012 raised intelligence issues, including debates on whether it was a terrorist attack and if there was a protest prior. The intelligence community initially assessed incorrectly that a protest had occurred. The intelligence community initially assessed incorrectly on September 12 that a protest had occurred in the Benghazi attack. The assessment was later revised based on new information, acknowledging it as a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. Analysts faced challenges in making judgments with incomplete information, and the nature of intelligence work involves evolving assessments as more information becomes available. This incident highlighted the importance of accurate intelligence analysis following past failures in providing advance warning of attacks and flawed estimates of weapons of mass destruction. The intelligence community's analytical offices faced scrutiny after past failures like 9/11 and Iraqi WMD estimates. Congressional oversight on Benghazi aims to assess improvements in analytic tradecraft. Challenges in evaluating intelligence analysis have been noted, but select committees have shown capability in independent evaluations. Oversight questions on Benghazi include the validity of the initial protest judgment and the credibility of protest information at the time. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in U.S. counterterrorism efforts has been crucial, providing intelligence collection and the ability to launch weapons at designated targets. Operated remotely, UAVs offer advantages such as avoiding direct combat and diplomatic complications. The use of UAVs in U.S. counterterrorism efforts provides significant advantages, avoiding diplomatic complications and direct combat. Military services and intelligence agencies operate UAVs based on operational and statutory considerations. Concerns have been raised about expanded UAV use in targeted attacks, questioning the legality and effectiveness of such actions. Some question the effectiveness of drone strikes in the long term, warning that attacks in countries like Pakistan may fuel opposition to U.S. policy goals and strengthen al-Qaeda. Former DNI Blair highlighted civilian casualties and resentment towards high-tech strikes in Pakistan. Congress is expected to closely monitor UAV use in counterterrorism efforts. FBI Director Mueller implemented reforms to enhance intelligence efforts post-9/11, addressing past criticisms of intelligence collection and sharing. Congress has expressed concerns about these issues. The FBI implemented reforms post-9/11 to enhance intelligence efforts, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of these changes. The Fort Hood shooting in 2009 revealed shortcomings in information dissemination within the FBI, prompting a Senate investigation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security to identify and assess terrorist threats to the homeland. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security to identify and assess terrorist threats to the homeland. The Directorate has since been divided into two components, with intelligence collection and analysis functions now handled by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was established in January 2003 under the DCI, and later transferred to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to assess potential terrorist threats. NCTC serves as a nexus for foreign and domestic intelligence agencies, while I&A acts as a liaison between federal, state, and local partners with a broader mandate beyond counterterrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) within the Department of Homeland Security to assess terrorist threats. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) has significant authority over intelligence agencies within DOD, with potential conflicts with the DNI's office. Stephen Cambone and James Clapper have held the position, with Michael Vickers confirmed in 2011. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) has considerable authority over intelligence agencies within DOD, serving as Director of Defense Intelligence and on the DNI's executive committee. There are concerns about potential conflicts with the DNI's office and the relationship between the two positions. Congressional interest remains in the mission and responsibilities of the USD(I) and its relationship with the DNI. Intelligence officials claim there is no unnecessary duplication of effort in collecting humint overseas. Intelligence officials emphasize effective coordination between CIA and DOD humint collectors. Concerns raised about DOD's management of intelligence personnel led to the creation of Defense Clandestine Service. Senate committee froze funding for DOD's human intelligence personnel growth in 2013. The Senate committee froze funding for DOD's human intelligence personnel growth in 2013, despite significant expansion in CIA and DOD case officer ranks since 9/11. Congressional provisions require full disclosure of intelligence activities to the intelligence committees. The House Intelligence Committee included a provision in its FY2010 intelligence authorization bill that would remove the Gang of Eight provisions and require that all committee Members be briefed on all intelligence activities, including covert actions, unless the committee itself decided to limit notification. The Administration expressed firm opposition to this provision. The Senate version of the FY2010 intelligence authorization bill, which became P.L. 111-259, addresses notification of covert actions and intelligence activities. It requires the Administration to provide information to all committee members or explain reasons for withholding information. Members have expressed frustration with lack of consultation on intelligence activities, as seen during the Senate confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan. The Senate Intelligence Authorization legislation, passed in January 2013, focused on tighter restrictions to prevent unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The bill includes anti-leak proposals such as limiting interaction between the media and cleared personnel, developing an insider threat program, and allowing the government to withhold pensions of those who illegally disclose classified data. The Senate Intelligence Authorization legislation passed in January 2013 focused on preventing unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The bill included anti-leak proposals and revised the definition of \"intelligence agency\" to encompass all elements of the intelligence community. The White House and the DNI also took measures to address unauthorized disclosures, but the effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain. The GAO has the authority to audit and investigate the use of public funds, with exceptions for intelligence activities. Some members believe the GAO should have a role in overseeing intelligence efforts. Some Members believe the GAO should have a role in overseeing intelligence efforts, despite resistance from the Bush and Obama Administrations. Provisions for an expanded GAO role were included in the Senate and House FY2011 Intelligence Authorization bills, with an amendment added to the FY2011 Defense Authorization bill requiring the DNI to provide necessary information for GAO analysis. The DNI issued Intelligence Community Directive Number 114 to govern GAO access to intelligence information, with restrictions on core national intelligence capabilities. GAO responded positively but noted potential hindrances to their work. The DNI issued Intelligence Community Directive Number 114 to govern GAO access to intelligence information, with restrictions on core national intelligence capabilities. However, some language in the directive could hinder GAO's work, prompting Congress to examine its interpretation and impact on GAO access. The intelligence community is structured around major agencies responsible for specific intelligence disciplines, including signals intelligence (sigint), imagery intelligence (imint), and human intelligence (humint). Sigint collection is handled by NSA at Fort Meade, MD, with ongoing changes in culture and operations to adapt to evolving encryption systems and global threats. The NSA has undergone significant changes in culture and operations since the late 1990s to adapt to new technologies and target terrorist groups. Lieutenant General Michael Hayden played a key role in reorganizing the agency. The initiative involved early retirements and outsourcing functions. The imagery intelligence discipline, collected through satellites, manned aircraft, and UAVs, is also undergoing profound changes. The satellite program covering the Soviet Union was a major achievement for the U.S. intelligence community. The U.S. intelligence community's achievement of acquiring accurate intelligence on military targets from the Soviet Union was crucial for defense and strategic planning during the Cold War. Today, there are more collection targets, requiring additional satellites for surveillance. The use of commercial satellite imagery by federal agencies raises questions about meeting intelligence requirements. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing and dissemination, later renamed the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) was formerly known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). NGA's goal is to use imagery and geospatial information to describe physical features and activities on Earth. The CIA is the primary collector of human intelligence (humint), but the Defense Department also plays a role through defense attach\u00e9s and other agents. Critics argue that inadequate humint has been a systemic issue, impacting the ability to prevent events like the 9/11 attacks. The need for humint from clandestine sources like terrorist groups or narcotics traffickers is crucial, as they do not appear at embassy social gatherings. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under nonofficial cover presents challenges such as administrative complexities, conflicts of interest, and corruption risks. The CIA established guidelines in 1995 to govern the recruitment of informants with unsavory backgrounds, aiming to prevent conflicts of interest and corruption. The FY2002 Intelligence Authorization Act directed the DCI to rescind and replace these guidelines, which were replaced in July 2002. One major constraint on humint collection is the availability of personnel trained in appropriate languages. The CIA established guidelines in 1995 for informant recruitment, which were replaced in July 2002. A major constraint on humint collection is the availability of personnel trained in appropriate languages. Efforts are being made to recruit experts in a wider range of languages and dialects, including the use of civilian contract personnel, military reservists, and bonuses for maintaining proficiency. The National Security Education Program provides scholarships and career training for individuals in national security agencies. Masint, a highly technical discipline, involves analytical refinements to information collected by sigint and imint sensors, including spectral imaging for object identification based on light reflection and absorption. Masint involves analytical refinements to information collected by sigint and imint sensors, including spectral imaging for object identification based on light reflection and absorption. DIA and other DOD agencies handle masint, but retaining personnel with expertise in masint systems is a challenge due to better-paying opportunities in private industry. Open source information (osint) from various sources like newspapers, internet websites, and TV is becoming increasingly important for gathering information on a wide range of topics. Some believe that intelligence agencies should be more aggressive in using osint, which may reduce the need for certain collection efforts. The availability of osint raises questions about the necessity of intelligence agencies to collect, analyze, and disseminate information. The Intelligence Reform Act established an Open Source Center to coordinate open source intelligence for other agencies, managed by CIA personnel. Integrating data from different intelligence sources remains a challenge due to technical issues and security concerns. Some argue that intelligence officials prioritize information security over sharing essential data. The Intelligence Reform Act mandated the establishment of an Intelligence Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing terrorism-related information. Barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement information have been a challenge, but the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 allowed for more sharing. The Homeland Security Act and the creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center aimed to improve information sharing between agencies. The Homeland Security Act and subsequent legislation aimed to improve information sharing between agencies to combat terrorism. The National Counterterrorism Center was established to analyze and integrate intelligence related to terrorism, with budgetary divisions between the National Intelligence Program and the Military Intelligence Program. The National Counterterrorism Center was established to analyze and integrate intelligence related to terrorism, with budgetary divisions between the National Intelligence Program and the Military Intelligence Program. The bulk of national intelligence spending, over $50 billion, is hidden within the DOD budget, described in classified annexes to legislation. Intelligence spending is authorized in intelligence authorization acts, with a \"catch-all\" provision in defense appropriations acts when authorization legislation is not enacted. Members of Congress have access to classified annexes but must make special arrangements to read them. In response to a lawsuit, DCI George Tenet disclosed that the intelligence budget for FY1997 was $26.6 billion, with FY1998 at $26.7 billion. Figures for subsequent years were not released. The Intelligence Reform Act in 2004 did not require public disclosure of intelligence spending amounts. However, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated the DNI to publicly disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the NIP, with the President having the option to waive or postpone disclosure after FY2008. The DNI disclosed the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the NIP, with amounts for FY2008 at $47.5 billion, FY2009 at $49.8 billion, FY2010 at $53.1 billion, FY2011 at $54.6 billion, FY2012 at $53.9 billion, and FY2013 requested. Additionally, the total annual intelligence spending was stated to be $75 billion in 2009, including military intelligence activities. The MIP appropriations for FY2010 were $27 billion, decreasing to $24 billion in FY2011. The NIP budget for FY2012 was $53.9 billion, and the requested amount for FY2013 was $52.6 billion. The FY2013 intelligence authorization bill was slightly above the President's request. The Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over the NIP, while the House Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over both NIP and MIP programs. Intelligence spending is mainly done by agencies within DOD, involving oversight from armed services committees. Most intelligence appropriations are included in national defense acts for agencies like CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA. The intelligence budgeting process involves funds for various intelligence agencies, including the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA. There have been discussions about establishing a select panel within the appropriations committee to oversee intelligence program appropriations, but this has not been consistently implemented. Intelligence budgeting issues were central to the debate on intelligence reform legislation in 2004, with a focus on the role of the Director of National Intelligence in developing the annual National Intelligence Program budget. The annual National Intelligence Program budget is separate from the MIP budgets prepared by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The goal is to ensure unity of effort in monitoring terrorist activities. The National Intelligence Program includes major components of the Defense Department like NSA, NRO, and NGA. P.L. 108-458 provides broad budgetary authorities to the DNI, with guidelines to respect statutory responsibilities of other departments. Implementing the Intelligence Reform Act's budgetary provisions remains complex. Observers anticipate that the implementation of the Intelligence Reform Act's budgetary provisions will rely on effective relationships between the Office of the DNI, DOD, and the White House staff. Recent legislative actions, such as the FY2012 Intelligence Authorization bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, have introduced provisions to align intelligence budget submissions with Defense Department formats. These changes aim to enhance the DNI's management of intelligence accounts and improve congressional oversight. In response to the September 11 attacks, the Senate and House Intelligence Committees conducted a joint investigation known as the \"Joint Inquiry.\" The inquiry found that while the Intelligence Community had general indications of a possible terrorist attack in 2001, they did not have specific information on the timing and details of the attacks. Former policymakers, CIA, and FBI officials testified during public hearings led by Eleanor Hill, the inquiry staff director. The Intelligence Community had information prior to September 11 about the details of the attacks. The Joint Inquiry found a steady stream of intelligence reporting from 1998 to 2001 indicating the possibility of terrorist attacks in the US. Specific terrorists and the use of civilian airliners were mentioned in the reports. The inquiry also highlighted the lack of preparedness in the intelligence community to deal with global terrorism, budgetary inefficiencies, shortage of linguists and human sources, and a lack of information sharing among agencies. Recommendations were made to strengthen intelligence capabilities. The intelligence committees recommended creating a Cabinet-level Director of National Intelligence separate from the CIA director, with greater authority over intelligence agencies in the Defense Department. They also suggested reorienting the FBI to counterterrorism and possibly creating a new domestic surveillance agency. An independent commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks was established in the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act, with Thomas H. Kean as chairman and Lee H. Hamilton as vice chairman. Hearings were held in spring 2004 with Administration and outside witnesses. The 9/11 Commission, led by Kean and Hamilton, held hearings in spring 2004 on intelligence agencies' roles before the 9/11 attacks. The report, published in July 2004, recommended creating a National Intelligence Director to manage the National Intelligence Program and oversee agencies contributing to it. The NID would submit a budget and nominees for agency heads to the President, with DOD taking lead on paramilitary operations. Congress was advised to pass a separate annual appropriations act for intelligence. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a National Intelligence Director to oversee intelligence agencies and manage the National Intelligence Program. President Bush signed executive orders to reform intelligence, including establishing a National Counterterrorism Center. Legislative proposals were introduced to establish a separate National Intelligence Director from the CIA Director. The Senate passed S. 2845 and the House passed H.R. 10 to create the position. The focus of the conference committee was on the authorities of the proposed Director of National Intelligence regarding budgets and operations of major intelligence agencies in the Department of Defense. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed into law in December 2004 as P.L. 108-458, addressed the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence over major intelligence agencies in the Department of Defense. Ongoing oversight of the Act's implementation continued in the 113th Congress, with potential modifications or addressing difficulties through executive orders or memoranda of understanding. In December 2005, reports of NSA surveillance outside of FISA parameters sparked criticism of the Administration. The Bush Administration defended monitoring communications involving Al Qaeda affiliates in the US based on constitutional authority and the Joint Resolution of September 18, 2001. Debate arose over whether FISA should govern such surveillance. In March 2006, procedures for oversight of NSA efforts were established, with legislative initiatives considered to modify FISA. Differing views on NSA efforts were reflected in the House Intelligence Committee's 2006 report. In January 2007, decisions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court prompted the Bush Administration's response. In response to decisions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in January 2007, the Bush Administration announced that electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program would now require approval from the FISC. The Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing in May 2007 to discuss proposed revisions to FISA to accommodate changes in communication technologies. A judge on the FISC ruled in 2007 that surveillance of foreign communications passing through the US required a FISC order. The Director of National Intelligence issued a statement in August 2007 supporting FISA modernization without the need for court orders for intelligence activities. The DNI issued a statement on FISA modernization in August 2007, arguing against the need for court orders for collecting foreign intelligence from overseas targets. The Protect America Act (PAA) was signed into law on August 5, 2007, allowing surveillance without court orders for foreign-to-foreign communications. This legislation also permitted the DNI and Attorney General to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year. The Protect America Act (PAA) was signed into law on August 5, 2007, allowing surveillance without court orders for foreign-to-foreign communications. It permitted the DNI and Attorney General to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year, including U.S. persons located outside of the United States. The DNI and Attorney General had to certify that this acquisition did not constitute electronic surveillance, with the right to contest in court. The PAA expired on February 1, 2008, and efforts to extend it further failed in the House. H.R. 5349 was rejected on February 13. The RESTORE Act (H.R. 3773) was passed on November 15, 2007, to clarify surveillance rules for communications between non-U.S. persons outside the United States. Strict minimization procedures would apply if a U.S. person's communications were incidentally intercepted. Court orders would be required for targeting non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the U.S. with unknown parties in the communication. The RESTORE Act (H.R. 3773) clarified surveillance rules for communications between non-U.S. persons outside the United States. It required court orders for targeting non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the U.S. with unknown parties in the communication. The Senate Intelligence Committee reported its own version of a FISA amendment on October 26, 2007, allowing targeting of persons outside the U.S. for foreign intelligence information with increased judicial oversight and quarterly audits. The Senate bill required FISC approval for targeting a U.S. person outside the U.S. for foreign intelligence information. It also provided retroactive immunity to telecom companies for assistance in intelligence activities. The role of the judiciary in overseeing surveillance involving U.S. persons was a central issue. FISA allowed electronic surveillance of U.S. persons with a FISC order. The Senate approved S. 2248 on February 12, 2008, allowing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information with FISC approval. The House amendment to H.R. 3773 required FISC review of procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. even if not believed to be communicating with a U.S. person. The House amendment to H.R. 3773 added unprecedented requirements for targeting communications of non-U.S. persons, which the Bush Administration argued could delay collection efforts. It required FISC approval for targeting procedures and minimization procedures, or a determination of an emergency situation with certification filed within seven days. For acquisitions targeting a U.S. person believed to be outside the U.S., a FISC order was required for up to 90 days, renewable for additional periods. Emergency acquisitions had to be followed by a court order application within seven days. The House version of H.R. 3773 did not grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies but allowed them to defend themselves in court. It also proposed a commission on warrantless electronic surveillance activities from 2001 to 2007. After discussions, a new bill, H.R. 6304, was introduced to strengthen FISC's role in intelligence surveillance and provide telecom companies a chance to prove their actions were in response to executive branch requests. H.R. 6304 was passed by the House and Senate in 2008, becoming P.L. 110-261. The FISA provisions, including those for \"Lone Wolf\" terrorists, roving wiretaps, and access to business records, were extended multiple times until June 1, 2015, by various legislative acts. The House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued reports on various Intelligence Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2005 to 2010. The Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2009 to 2012 were issued by the 110th to 112th Congress. Additionally, reports on counterterrorism intelligence capabilities and prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq were also published by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2005 to 2012 were authorized by the 108th to 112th Congress. The Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2011 to 2013 were authorized by the 112th Congress. The reports cover various intelligence activities and the attempted terrorist attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253. Additionally, there are references to the 9/11 Commission Report and a review of FBI security programs."
