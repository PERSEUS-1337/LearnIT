The proliferation of nuclear weapons is now a major military threat post-Cold War. The UN Security Council recognizes the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapon use. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports. North Korea and the United States were involved in nuclear discussions. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement exchanging nuclear technology. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons programs and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States maintains consistent security interests in line with international treaties. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones to prevent conflicts and arms races. It signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty in 1996. The IAEA is important for countering proliferation but may face challenges due to constraints. The US policy includes immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons and strengthen international nonproliferation efforts. The United States is committed to supporting the treaty and enhancing controls over nuclear equipment transfer. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage challenges and could be converted into fuel for nuclear warheads if in the wrong hands. The United States should adopt a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and prevent their use worldwide. The United States should adopt a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and their use worldwide. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by reaching agreements with Russia on fissile materials, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads, negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and enforcing multilateral agreements for continuous reduction of nuclear arsenals. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by reaching multilateral agreements to significantly reduce nuclear arsenals, halt production of weapons-usable fissile materials, strengthen IAEA safeguards, and enhance nuclear and dual-use export controls. To reduce nuclear proliferation, the United States plans to strengthen export controls, impose sanctions on proliferators, reduce regional tensions, and advocate for a \"no first use\" policy among nuclear weapon states. The United States aims to assist countries in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if nuclear weapons are used against them, negotiate with Russia to eliminate tactical nuclear weapons, ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's nuclear activities, and start negotiations on START III with Russia. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those related to nuclear non-proliferation and negotiations with Russia. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms related to nuclear non-proliferation, including \"fissile materials,\" \"IAEA,\" \"no first use,\" \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" and more. The Act defines terms related to nuclear non-proliferation, including \"nuclear weapon state,\" \"START I treaty,\" \"START II treaty,\" and \"START III treaty.\" These terms refer to countries with nuclear weapons, treaties for reducing strategic arms, and discussions between US and Russian leaders."
