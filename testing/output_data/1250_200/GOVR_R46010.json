The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged states to adopt net metering to offset energy provided by utilities with on-site generation. This is relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar in the nation's electricity system. Net metering policies, including how states have modified them, are crucial for the deployment of solar energy sources. Congress may consider various options regarding state policy modifications, such as restrictions or encouragement, based on their priorities. This report provides background information and discusses current issues related to net metering policy. Net metering policies determine compensation for electricity delivered to the grid from distributed generation. It involves subtracting generated electricity from consumed electricity for billing. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. Net metering policies in the United States require utilities to offer compensation for electricity delivered to the grid from distributed generation. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place, with almost 2 million customers participating in 2018. This represents about 1% of U.S. electricity customers, showing an increase in participation from 2013 to 2018. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018, with participation rates varying by state. Hawaii has the highest participation rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. Electricity ratemaking is the process of allocating costs to customers incurred by utilities in producing and delivering electricity. State regulators approve rates for utilities to charge customers, ensuring cost recovery through bill payments. This includes costs of power plant operation, fuel, and compliance. Electricity ratemaking involves utilities recovering costs from customers through bill payments. This includes building and operating power plants, maintaining transmission systems, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. Rates are typically set based on volumetric rates, where customers within a customer class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour. Customers' bills vary based on electricity consumption, with regulators estimating rates to cover total costs. Electricity ratemaking involves utilities recovering costs from customers through bill payments. Costs for electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and other utility expenses are shared among all customers. Customer charges, separate from electricity rates, appear as fixed values on bills. Some high-consuming customers may have special system modifications and pay demand charges in addition to volumetric charges. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering. Net metering policies vary among states, with some compensating customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity. State decisions on compensation mechanisms can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG) systems. Initially, NEM was seen as a simple approach with the retail rate as a proxy for rate setting. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation due to reflecting total utility costs. This encouraged participation in net metering more than other compensation approaches. Retail rates for net metering may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Net metering customers reduce utility-provided electricity but still rely on other utility services, potentially causing rates for non-net metering customers to rise over time. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers, leading to cross-subsidies. Studies vary in estimating the extent of cross-subsidies, with methodological differences contributing to the lack of consensus. Local factors like distributed generation penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies, making extrapolation challenging. One synthesis of estimates conducted in or around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer per year. Observers may disagree on the extent of cross-subsidies warranting policy action. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, including net metering, and found that DG would likely result in rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers, depending on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Some states are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cost shifts and cross-subsidies. This is part of a larger effort to allocate system costs and benefits more precisely. Regulatory decisions and participation rates will influence the extent of these changes. Some states are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cost shifts and cross-subsidies. This approach is meant to allow utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance and operation while preserving perceived advantages for compensating net metering customers at the retail rate. Proponents argue that fixed charges reduce cost shifting and increase fairness, while opponents, including the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe that net metering promotes competition and societal benefits that fixed charges may ignore. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate as an alternative compensation rate for net metering customers, which primarily reflects costs associated with producing energy. This rate is usually lower than retail rates and may be estimated by a regulator using an independent methodology or by referral to wholesale electricity markets. Avoided cost rates are lower than retail rates and apply to net metering customers with solar PV. Compensation is based on a value of solar rate, reflecting societal benefits. VOS rates can be higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates. New York uses a similar approach for distributed energy resources. The approach to compensating distributed energy resources (DER) in New York reflects estimated grid and societal benefits. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, with challenges in quantifying time- and location-specific costs and benefits. Different assumptions and value categories impact study results. State net metering policies vary in aspects beyond compensation, such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, all of which can impact distributed generation deployment. Program caps, which limit participation based on factors like power units or percentage of electricity demand, can mitigate risks to the electricity system and prevent financial impacts for utilities. Net metering policies vary by state, including program caps and source eligibility. Solar energy is the primary source for net metering, but other energy types can participate based on cost and customer factors. Customers may have periods of excess generation or consumption. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation for it. Credits for surplus generation can carry over to the next billing period, potentially reducing total electricity costs to $0. Different provisions exist for credit retention policies, allowing for various arrangements such as single generators behind a single meter or aggregate net metering for multiple meters on a property. Aggregate net metering applies to single customers with multiple electricity meters on their property, such as farms, municipalities, or school districts. Shared net metering, like in community solar projects, involves multiple customers sharing the same generation capacity. Virtual net metering is a form of shared net metering for onsite projects, like multi-family dwellings. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address state net metering policies, including limiting regulators' ability to lower compensation rates or add fixed charges to bills. Legislation in Congress addresses state net metering policies, including considerations for cross-subsidies, community solar net billing, and studies on costs and benefits. Bills in the 116th Congress require studies by the National Academies on alternative incentives for distributed generation, net metering techniques, and consumer incentives."
