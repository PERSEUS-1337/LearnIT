    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. Defense spending trends and force structure changes have necessitated additional base closures. The Department of Defense began advocating for more base closures in 1997 with the release of the Quadrennial Defense Review by Secretary William Cohen. He emphasized the need for further closures to align infrastructure with force structure reductions and achieve significant cost savings for future readiness and weapons programs. Secretary of Defense Cohen proposed new rounds of base closures to fund future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. However, there was resistance from Capitol Hill due to concerns about economic and political fallout in their districts. Despite initial pushback, some Senators pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure and secure funds for new weapons. On July 9, the Senate voted against the McCain-Levin initiative for new base closings. A substitute amendment by Senators Dorgan, Lott, and Daschle required DOD to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner for possible base closures in 2001. In the House, Representative Hefley opposed new closures for at least five years, questioning DOD's savings estimates. Despite opposition in Congress, senior DOD officials and the President continued to push for new rounds of base closures. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili advocated for closures to free up funds for priority weapons programs. Congressional Budget Office could not confirm DOD's savings estimates, questioning the need for immediate closures without a full understanding of military implications. Gen. John Shalikashvili and Secretary of Defense announced Defense Reform Initiative with two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to save $2.8 billion annually. Support for closures came from the National Defense Panel urging quick action. The DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel urged Congress and the Defense Department to quickly restore the base realignment and closure process, calling for closures to begin earlier than the current 2001-2005 proposal. President Clinton opposed closing two Air Force maintenance depots despite recommendations for cost savings. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly depots, opting for privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas. However, this move was criticized for political meddling and favoritism. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan, fearing job loss and vulnerability to future base closures. Resentment over Clinton's intervention in the 1995 base closure process persisted. Some Members opposed President Clinton's intervention in the 1995 base closure process, leading to resentment and ongoing debates. Legislation was proposed to block DOD from privatizing depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases, with concerns about job loss and vulnerability to future closures. Despite initial approval by House and Senate committees, depot-related provisions were ultimately removed from the DOD authorization bill due to threats of filibuster. The depot-related provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill due to threats of filibuster. Efforts to restore these restrictions were defeated in the House and withdrawn in the Senate. The language became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the defense authorization bill, with opposing camps unwilling to yield. A resolution was eventually achieved by the Senate. The Senate and House conferees reached a compromise on depot work restrictions, increasing the limit for private contractors to 50%. The House passed the conference report, but the Senate debated it without a final vote. Senator Hutchison's attempt to postpone the vote was denied, and the Senate eventually passed the report with a 90 to 10 vote. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), including language prohibiting DOD from taking any actions. In November 1998, Clinton signed a bill (P.L. 105-85) that included language prohibiting DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The report was due by January-February 1999, but DOD submitted it early in April 1998. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, stating that the current base structure was 23% in excess and savings from closures would fund modernization and readiness. The Defense Secretary emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, stating that the current base structure was in excess and savings from closures would fund modernization and readiness. The base closure report highlighted significant imbalances between force and base structures, with projected savings exceeding initial estimates. The Defense Secretary called for new base closure legislation to address excess base structures and fund modernization. The 1988-1995 rounds were expected to exceed savings estimates, with additional savings projected for 2001 and 2005 closures. The report recommended following previous closure commission models and highlighted successful economic recovery in impacted communities. A controversial Air Force memo mentioned White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin to pursue maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members of Congress strongly opposed new base closures, accusing the Administration of meddling in the process. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with the Senate committee rejecting a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin were key figures in the debate. The Senate committee defeated a proposed new round of base closures in 2001, with Senators McCain and Levin considering a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. However, the majority sentiment was against them, leading to the abandonment of their initiative. Senator Inhofe's amendment to the bill aimed to make it harder for the Pentagon to close bases, setting new thresholds for civilian personnel numbers. The Inhofe amendment in the FY1999 defense authorization bill aimed to hinder the Pentagon from closing bases by setting new thresholds for civilian personnel numbers and expressing opposition to new closure rounds until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding DOD's savings estimates consistent with its own. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding savings estimates consistent with its own. However, CBO explained that actual BRAC savings cannot be measured as they are avoided costs. DOD can only estimate savings, lacking analysis on potential base closures and impact on local communities. Some requested data, including original cost and savings estimates, were not located by DOD. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, providing more detail than the CBO review. GAO gave DOD good grades overall, stating that most required information was provided. It noted that previous BRAC closure rounds would result in significant net savings but emphasized that DOD's report only offered a rough estimate of costs and savings, lacking precise accounting. GAO also highlighted that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. The GAO reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding that previous BRAC actions had resulted in significant net savings. DOD's analysis showed no long-term issues affecting military capabilities due to BRAC actions, with communities rebounding economically. Proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would follow similar processes. Congress debated authorizing new base closings in the 106th Congress. Senator McCain and Senator Levin sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003. Senator McCain highlighted the excess infrastructure capacity claimed by DOD and emphasized the potential savings from closing and realigning bases. The bill proposed changes to the BRAC selection process, including starting and finishing two months later in 2001 to allow a new President to nominate commission members. Secretary of Defense Cohen also emphasized the importance of further base closures. Secretary of Defense Cohen stressed the importance of further base closures to improve efficiency and save money, despite opposition from Congress and constituents. He emphasized the wastage of money on unneeded facilities and highlighted the potential savings of $20 billion during implementation and $3 billion annually thereafter. The Senate and House rejected Defense Cohen's call for more base closure rounds, blocking DOD's initiative for the third year in a row. Despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin, the proposal was effectively quashed for the year. The Administration sought authority to close bases in 2003 and 2005, citing a strong economy as an opportune time for Congress to act. Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Congress to improve the base closing process due to bureaucratic obstacles and potential cost savings of $20 billion. Despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin, Congress rejected authorizing new base closure rounds in 2000. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill to authorize new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005. The Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating potential savings of up to $21 billion by 2015. Senator Hutchison expressed concerns about closing more military bases prematurely. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill to authorize new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005, supported by Taxpayers for Common Sense for potential savings of up to $21 billion by 2015. Senator Hutchison expressed concerns about closing more military bases prematurely, highlighting past BRAC decisions now considered mistakes. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments due to excess capacity in military infrastructure. The Pentagon proposed a new round of base closings and consolidations under the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI)\" starting in 2003, based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. Brooks AFB was allowed to transfer its property to the local community as a demonstration project approved by Congress. The Senate Armed Services Committee grappled with base closure proposals, ultimately recommending a new round in 2003. The full Senate approved the closures by a narrow margin, marking the first success in five years of effort. General Henry H. Shelton emphasized the need for cost-saving measures in a letter to Senator John Warner. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld advocated for closing excess military bases to redirect resources for war-fighting. Opponents argued that the timing, amidst the war on terrorism and economic uncertainty, was not ideal. Supporters emphasized the need to prioritize military resources over home-state interests. Senator John McCain urged trust in military leadership. McCain urged trust in military leadership during the stalemate over base closures in the House and Senate FY2002 defense authorization bill. After weeks of deadlock, a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) on December 28, 2001. The conference report retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language with some modifications. The 2005 BRAC Act extends the authority for base closure and realignment, requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit force structure plans and review all types of installations. Certification is needed for closure and realignment, with military value as the primary consideration for recommendations. The 2005 BRAC Act extends the authority for base closure and realignment, requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit force structure plans and review all types of installations. Certification is needed for closure and realignment, with military value as the primary consideration for recommendations. The process includes increasing the number of commission members, allowing the Secretary of Defense to testify on proposed base additions, and prohibiting privatization-in-place unless recommended by the commission. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld successfully obtained approval from Congress for a new round of base closures. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld succeeded in winning approval from Congress for a new round of base closures. The 2005 BRAC Act raised concerns for communities near military bases regarding survival and range encroachment, prompting defensive and offensive strategies to keep military units at home or acquire units from other areas to ensure base survival. The 2005 BRAC Act raised concerns about encroachment on military bases, potentially leading to closures. The process involves the President's nominations, approval or disapproval, and Congress's 45-day window for objections."
