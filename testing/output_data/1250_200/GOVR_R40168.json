    "content": "High levels of oil imports and high crude oil and gasoline prices in recent years have increased interest in the U.S. fuel supply. Congressional focus has been on alternatives to petroleum, improving transportation sector efficiency, and enhancing stability and security in the petroleum supply and refining sectors. Global oil prices and refinery constraints led to historic highs in U.S. gasoline pump prices from 2006 to 2008. Interest in alternative fuels and vehicles fluctuates with oil and gasoline price volatility. Statutory policies can help maintain interest during market fluctuations. After a period of high oil imports and prices, interest in alternative fuels and efficient transportation grew. Petroleum and gasoline prices fluctuated, peaking in spring 2011 before stabilizing. Environmental concerns also drove interest in alternatives to petroleum. Federal policies aimed to reduce petroleum consumption by promoting alternative fuels and efficient vehicles. Key tax incentives for biofuels and electric vehicles expired in 2011 but were extended through 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended some incentives for biofuels through 2013, including a mandate to use biofuels in transportation that will increase yearly through 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) required the use of 15.2 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels in 2012, with a proposed increase to 16.55 billion gallons in 2013. Covered entities must submit credits (RINs) equal to their obligations each year. Cases of fraud in the biodiesel RINs market have led to criminal prosecutions and EPA quality-assurance guidelines. Volatility in the ethanol RINs spot market raises concerns about RFS implementation. EPA approved a partial waiver allowing up to 15% ethanol blends in gasoline, removing a component of the \"blend wall.\" Stakeholder concerns over potential engine and infrastructure damage from E15 led to restrictions on its use in certain vehicles and applications. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by federal agencies, state governments, and alternative fuel providers. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to limit EPA's authority to implement the E15 waiver due to concerns over potential engine and infrastructure damage. Interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies has grown due to environmental issues, energy security, vehicle emissions, and high gasoline prices. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by federal agencies, state governments, and fuel providers. It also established tax incentives for electric, alternative fuel, and hybrid vehicles. Congress began working on comprehensive energy legislation in response to high fuel prices in the early 2000s. The 108th Congress debated vehicle tax credits, amendments to vehicle purchase requirements, renewable fuel mandates, and tax credits for ethanol and biodiesel fuels. However, the bill stalled. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005, P.L. 109-58) was signed by President Bush on August 8, 2005, addressing energy policy issues. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140) expanded renewable fuel mandates, tightened fuel economy standards, and established the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Biofuels are promoted for energy security, environmental quality, and farm income, with support in the 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills. The 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills included titles to promote biofuels and other farm-based energy supplies. The 2002 Farm Bill established programs for biofuels and biorefineries, while the 2008 Farm Bill expanded on these programs and increased biofuels tax credits for cellulosic fuels. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 supported alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles through tax credits and grants. Tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel production expired in 2009. Tax credits for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and ethanol production were set to expire, but were extended through 2013 by the Tax Relief Act of 2010 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Incentives were also extended for alternative fuels, advanced technology vehicles, and infrastructure for electric vehicles. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit was not extended. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Clean Air Act Amendments, and highway authorization bills have established fuel economy standards, promoted low emission vehicles, and provided tax incentives for alternative fuels. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended tax incentives for biodiesel and other alternative fuels. Recent events, such as high fuel prices, have renewed interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles. The high pump prices for gasoline and diesel fuel have raised concerns over fuel conservation and energy security. There is growing interest in more efficient vehicles or vehicles that abandon the use of petroleum altogether. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) requires an increase in fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon (mpg) combined in 2020. Ongoing technological developments in hybrid vehicles, ethanol fuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen fuel have raised key policy questions. The government is considering reducing its role in vehicle and fuel markets, focusing on the costs and environmental impacts of ethanol and hydrogen production. Gasoline prices have spiked due to various factors, leading to congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum. Tax incentives for alternative fuels were in place until the end of 2011. Interest in alternatives remains strong with key tax incentives for alternative fuels, including credits for ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic biofuels. Most incentives were extended through 2013, except for the conventional ethanol tax credit. Supporters argue that tax incentives are needed to promote the production and purchase of alternative fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal mandates for renewable fuels, including biofuels. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard in 2010, requiring the use of 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuels in transportation fuels. Ethanol from corn was primarily used to meet this mandate. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate in 2010 required the use of 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuels in transportation, mainly met with corn ethanol. The RFS also includes mandates for cellulosic biofuels and other advanced biofuels, with a 2013 mandate of 16.55 billion gallons. EPA's assessment of biofuels' greenhouse gas impacts has sparked controversy, with critics questioning the methodology. The RFS mandates a shift towards cellulosic biofuels, starting at 100 million gallons in 2010 and increasing to 16 billion gallons by 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of renewable fuels, including cellulosic biofuels, starting at 100 million gallons in 2010 and increasing to 16 billion gallons by 2022. However, due to production capacity constraints, EPA set the cellulosic biofuel mandate at 6.5 million gallons for 2010. Many projects have been delayed or scaled back, leading to a revised target of 5 million gallons for 2010. The EPA set the cellulosic biofuel mandate at 6.6 million gallons for 2011, 8.65 million gallons for 2012, and 14 million gallons for 2013. The 2012 mandate was challenged in court and vacated due to lack of commercial-scale production. The EPA argues that production capacity will increase in 2013. Ethanol concentration in gasoline was limited to 10% (E10) due to EPA regulations. The limit on ethanol concentration in gasoline is currently set at 10% (E10) due to various factors such as EPA regulations, vehicle warranties, and infrastructure design. However, to meet Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates, gasoline suppliers may need to blend ethanol above 10% or explore other options like using E85 or biodiesel. Stakeholders are advocating for higher ethanol blends like E15, E20, or higher, with Growth Energy applying for a waiver from the EPA in 2009. Stakeholders are advocating for EPA approval of higher-level ethanol blends like E15, E20, or higher. Growth Energy applied for a waiver in 2009 to increase the maximum ethanol concentration to 15% (E15). EPA approved the use of E15 in newer vehicles but deferred a decision on older vehicles due to emissions concerns. EPA denied a waiver for older vehicles and engines until sufficient data proves no negative impact on emissions control devices. EPA considers short- and long-term effects on emissions from various vehicles and engines. The blend wall concerns emissions control, vehicle warranties, and infrastructure effects. Automakers and small engine manufacturers limit ethanol levels due to equipment damage concerns. Older vehicles may experience corrosion, higher operating temperatures, and increased emissions with higher ethanol concentrations. Fueling infrastructure may need modifications to accommodate blends higher than E10. The EPA granted a waiver for E15 use in newer vehicles, but fuel pumps need labeling to prevent its use in older vehicles. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn, is a widely used biofuel in the US, but there is interest in developing biofuels with a smaller environmental footprint. Biofuels from cellulosic materials like fast-growing trees and agricultural wastes are seen as a way to reduce environmental impact and expand the US biofuels industry. However, converting cellulose into fuel is currently expensive due to complex chemical processing, with research focused on lowering costs. R&D is focused on reducing costs and increasing the feasibility of cellulosic biofuels. Efforts include increasing crop yields, developing harvesting techniques, and limiting environmental impact. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 provide support for the development of cellulosic biofuels. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 established a 50% depreciation allowance for cellulosic ethanol plants. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel mandate for advanced biofuels with specific requirements. The 2008 Farm Bill provided a tax credit for the production of cellulosic biofuels. The Renewable Fuel Standard is a market-based compliance system using Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) as credits. Obligated parties must submit Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations in the Renewable Fuel Standard program. RINs are 38-digit numbers representing data like the year, producer, and type of fuel. Concerns over RIN generation and market integrity led to the establishment of the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) for all RIN transactions. The EPA has implemented the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) for all RIN transactions to address concerns over RIN generation and market integrity. Obligated parties are responsible for certifying the validity of RINs they purchase or receive, with potential penalties for passing on fraudulent RINs. EPA issued Notices of Violations to companies for fraudulently generating biodiesel RINs, leading to criminal convictions. EPA is considering a system for third-party certification of RINs and proposed a Quality Assurance Plan program to provide an \"affirmative defense\" for obligated parties using fraudulent RINs. The EPA is finalizing rules regarding the use of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and the replacement of invalid RINs. Prices for renewable fuel RINs, particularly ethanol RINs, have seen a significant increase in early 2013, possibly due to concerns over the blend wall and RFS mandates. Some stakeholders are concerned about market speculation and a potential scarcity of RINs due to a reduction in U.S. ethanol output. Ethanol prices in Brazil and other countries can be lower than in the U.S. due to lower production costs and government incentives. Concerns over ethanol imports have also arisen, with added duties previously acting as a barrier but now expired. Before the duty expired, ethanol imports from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries were granted duty-free status, even if the ethanol was produced in a non-CBI country. This loophole allowed ethanol to be produced in another country, dehydrated in a CBI country, and then shipped to the United States, reaching up to 5% of the U.S. ethanol market. With the expiration of added duties, there may be more interest in importing ethanol, either through CBI countries or directly from ethanol producers, especially from Brazil due to the Renewable Fuel Standard requiring more advanced biofuels. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) may require the use of more advanced biofuels like Brazilian sugarcane ethanol in the future. If targets for cellulosic biofuels are not met, the mandate for other advanced biofuels could expand. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California could also increase demand for sugarcane ethanol. President Bush signed acts extending the duty on imported ethanol, but the duty has since expired. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates alternative fuel vehicle purchases for federal and state fleets. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates that federal and state vehicle fleets must be capable of operating on alternative fuels, with 90% of vehicles purchased by alternative fuel providers being alternative fuel vehicles. However, the effectiveness of this mandate has been criticized as vehicles purchased are often dual-fuel and primarily fueled by gasoline due to its availability and lower cost compared to alternative fuels. Many agencies have failed to meet their statutory obligation, leading to lawsuits to enforce compliance. In July 2002, a lawsuit was filed against federal agencies for failing to meet EPAct quotas. The court ordered agencies to prepare compliance reports, which have been completed. Most agencies have since complied, with all federal fleets meeting requirements in FY2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified EPAct 1992 requirements, mandating dual-fuel vehicles to operate on alternative fuels unless granted a waiver. The Secretary of Energy must conduct a study on EPAct effectiveness, and state/fuel provider fleets can petition for waivers based on fuel-saving measures. President Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, amending the definition of \"alternative fuel vehicle\" to include hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles. The DOE has the authority to extend requirements to local government and private fleets, but as of 2002, no determination had been made. A lawsuit prompted the U.S. District Court to order the DOE to establish a timeline for new rulemaking, resulting in a rulemaking issued on March 4, 2003. The U.S. District Court ordered the DOE to establish a timeline for a new rulemaking, which determined that a program promoting EPAct goals was not feasible. President Bush and Obama signed executive orders requiring federal agencies to use plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $300 million for high fuel economy vehicles. Supporters argue that tax incentives are more effective than purchase mandates. EPAct 1992 also established tax incentives for alternative fuel vehicles. Tax incentives for the purchase of vehicles and fuels are deemed more effective than purchase mandates. EPAct 1992 and Energy Policy Act of 2005 established tax credits for electric, clean-fuel, hybrid, and alternative fuel vehicles. The incentives varied in value and expiration dates based on vehicle technology. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 introduced a tax credit for plug-in vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for passenger vehicles depending on battery capacity. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified tax credits for plug-in vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for passenger vehicles depending on battery capacity. The law also established credits for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed four-wheeled plug-in vehicles, as well as for vehicle conversions to run on battery power. Purchasers can claim these credits even if subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Eligibility for the tax credit phases out after a manufacturer produces 200,000 eligible vehicles. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are synthetic fuels produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. They can be blended with conventional diesel and used in engines with few modifications. Interest in biodiesel is growing due to its ability to displace conventional diesel and its potential to promote rural economies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, production costs are currently high, leading to interest in providing tax incentives for production. The cost barriers for biodiesel and renewable diesel production have led to interest in tax incentives to reduce production costs. The American Jobs Creation Act provided a tax credit for biodiesel sales, with credits extended through 2008 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally, a credit of $0.10 per gallon was established for small agri-biodiesel producers. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel production through 2013. Interest has also grown in hydrogen fuel and fuel cells as a way to reduce dependence on energy imports and vehicle emissions. The Bush Administration supported research and development for hydrogen fuel and fuel cells to reduce vehicle emissions. Initiatives like the FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiative aimed to increase federal spending on R&D for these technologies. President Bush requested $1.8 billion between FY2004 and FY2008 for these initiatives. The Bush Administration supported research and development for hydrogen fuel and fuel cells to reduce vehicle emissions, requesting $1.8 billion between FY2004 and FY2008. Congress appropriated a total of $1.4 billion for the initiatives, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizing $3.3 billion through FY2010. Opponents argued that funding should focus on near-term technologies like hybrid vehicles, which have become increasingly popular in the United States. Hybrids, popular in the United States, combine a gasoline engine with an electrical motor system to improve efficiency and limit oil consumption. Some states offer incentives for hybrid vehicle drivers, such as exemptions from HOV lane requirements. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded incentives for hybrid vehicle purchases. EISA also established a program for federal loans to support new facilities or retooling for high-efficiency vehicles. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program, providing up to $25 billion in direct loans for automakers and parts suppliers to produce highly fuel efficient vehicles. Critics question the program's effectiveness in promoting technologies already incentivized by stricter fuel economy standards. The Government Accountability Office has raised concerns about DOE's technical expertise in evaluating loan applications and project performance. The California Energy Commission and various organizations in Washington, DC provide information on alternative fuel vehicles such as fuel cells, methanol, biodiesel, natural gas, propane, and ethanol. The U.S. Department of Energy also plays a role in promoting advanced technology vehicles through the ATVM Loan Program. The Renewable Fuels Association and the U.S. Department of Energy provide reports and information on alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also monitors the progress of acquiring alternative fuel vehicles and implementing loan programs."
