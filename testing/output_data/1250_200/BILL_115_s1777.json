For employees employed for less than a full year, the amount in subparagraph (A) is reduced based on the ratio of weeks not employed to 52. The applicable percentage is determined for subsection (a).

The low-wage employee ratio is calculated as the percentage of low-wage employees to total employees. Applicable employers meeting certain requirements will have their applicable percentage reduced by 25 points. This reduction applies to full-time low-wage employees and their families. The applicable employer must offer full-time low-wage employees the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored health plan. The plan must cover at least 60% of costs and the employee's contribution cannot exceed a certain percentage of their annual wages. Additionally, the employer must meet retirement plan requirements.

Final average pay is determined based on the period of consecutive years with the greatest compensation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for employers to meet requirements through a combination of defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Plans must meet requirements without considering social security and similar contributions and benefits. Certain employees may be excluded, such as those under 21 years old, with less than 1 year of service, or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Secretary of Labor must find a collective bargaining agreement for benefits covered under the plan to be valid. Nonresident aliens working outside the United States are also included. Definitions and special rules apply, including the meaning of 'wages' and the allocation of taxes among different entities treated as a single employer. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after chapter 36, related to benefits covered under a collective bargaining agreement and the allocation of taxes among entities treated as a single employer. Chapter 37 introduces the Corporate Responsibility Tax, with amendments applying to calendar years after the enactment of the Act."
