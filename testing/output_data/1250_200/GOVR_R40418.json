    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in laboratories. Departments like DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded high-containment laboratories to study dangerous pathogens, aiding in biodefense efforts. These labs offer better responses to biological attacks but also pose a risk as potential sources of materials or training for attackers. Research is also being conducted to develop countermeasures and diagnostics for dangerous pathogens. The federal government increased funding for biodefense post 9/11 and anthrax attacks, focusing on laboratory capacity. Funding rose from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. Concerns about aging infrastructure and limited capacity were exacerbated. Non-federal entities also expanded high-containment labs due to bioterrorism and emerging diseases threats. This raised policy questions on necessary capacity and federal investment. The federal government's increased funding for biodefense post 9/11 and anthrax attacks focused on expanding laboratory capacity, raising policy questions on necessary capacity and federal investment. Policymakers are now interested in the expansion of high-containment laboratories, with questions on optimal size, coordination of efforts, and balancing benefits with risks. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tightening government oversight of these facilities. This report focuses on the federal government's regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, oversight mechanisms, and policy options for congressional consideration. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety aims to prevent unintentional infections. Federal regulatory programs address these issues independently, with biosafety being a long-standing concern and biosecurity gaining recent attention. The federal government established the Select Agent Program to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. This program was created in response to the threat of bioterrorism, with laws like the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 and the USA PATRIOT Act increasing restrictions on possession of select agents. Increased restrictions on possession of select agents require entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. Scientists must register with the DOJ for access to select agents, with permits valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must implement security plans to prevent theft or unauthorized access, reviewed by HHS or USDA for compliance. The CDC and USDA review facilities for regulatory compliance and security plan implementation. Failure to comply with Select Agent Program regulations can result in fines. Possession of select agents without completing security risk assessments may violate federal law. Approximately 390 entities are certified to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff approved for access. The majority of certified entities are owned or operated by state or local governments, including public health laboratories. Federal government efforts aim to enhance testing and response capabilities in the event of a biological attack. The federal government has established a Laboratory Response Network connecting state or local public health laboratories to enhance testing and response capabilities in the event of a biological attack. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities choosing to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than comply with regulations. Inspectors General have conducted investigations on the Select Agent Program's internal controls, processing of applications, and regulatory compliance of facilities. The HHS and USDA Inspectors General found non-compliance with select agent regulations at universities and laboratories. Some entities withdrew their select agent licenses, and fines were imposed on organizations for violations. The CDC suspended a select agent certificate at Texas A&M University due to reporting failures and inadequate security assessments for lab workers. The HHS OIG fined 12 organizations $1,887,000 for Select Agent regulation violations. Scientists acknowledge risks of working with dangerous pathogens and follow guidelines like Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. CDC and NIH established biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for handling biological agents based on pathogen danger. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define different biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) based on the danger posed by pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are considered high-containment laboratories with specific physical and procedural protections. The guidelines outline primary and secondary barriers to infection, standard and special laboratory practices, and recommend biosafety levels be determined by a combination of pathogen and experiment. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines outline different biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) based on pathogen risk. Researchers must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing labs. BSL levels are determined by pathogen transmission potential and treatment availability. BSL-1 for low-risk, BSL-2 for treatable diseases, BSL-3 for serious diseases, and BSL-4 for life-threatening infections. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines recommend conducting procedures at BSL-3 for high individual risk activities and at BSL-4 for life-threatening diseases. Pathogens can be handled at lower biosafety levels based on the specific activity. Some select agents can be studied outside high-containment facilities, with anthrax recommended at BSL-2 for certain activities and BSL-3 for others. Thirteen select agents require BSL-4 containment, while thirty can be studied at BSL-2 depending on the procedure. BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may not always use select agents, so many are not subject to select agent regulations. BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion falling under the Select Agent Program, with compliance with BMBL guidelines being widely adopted. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is voluntary but required for federal contracts and grants, with noncompliance risking loss of funding. Some federal agencies mandate BMBL compliance in their laboratories. The BMBL guidelines are widely adopted in laboratories, including federal facilities, and those built using federal funds. Compliance is required for federal contracts and grants, with some agencies mandating compliance in their laboratories. The guidelines are also incorporated into building design standards and the Select Agent Program. The BMBL guidelines are widely adopted in laboratories, including federal facilities, and those built using federal funds. Compliance is required for federal contracts and grants, with some agencies mandating compliance in their laboratories. The guidelines are also incorporated into building design standards and the Select Agent Program. Design standards for NIH buildings include specifications for ventilation, utilities, and access controls. NIH issues checklists for high-containment laboratories to ensure requirements are met before occupancy. The process of certifying a laboratory is common in various agencies, with guidelines suggesting commissioning be done by companies not involved in facility design or construction. The NIH recommends commissioning or certifying laboratories through independent companies specialized in facility design. Individuals overseeing technical aspects should be licensed Professional Engineers with extensive experience. Non-compliance with biosafety guidelines could result in the withdrawal of federal funding. Grantee organizations may be required to demonstrate compliance if requested. Grantees are not required to submit documented assurance of compliance with regulations, but may need to provide evidence if requested. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research typically require an institutional biosafety committee to oversee compliance. The committee determines biosafety levels for research activities and may extend oversight to other research with biosafety concerns. IBCs help scientists determine appropriate protection levels for experiments. The BMBL suggests that IBCs oversee research with biosafety concerns and determine protection levels for experiments. Some experts argue that IBCs lack sufficient oversight. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with BMBL guidelines for entities possessing select agents. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased, with BSL-4 space in the US growing twelve-fold since 2004 due to federal construction and funding. The expansion of high-containment laboratory space in the United States has increased twelve-fold since 2004 due to federal construction and increased funding for research activities. The federal government is investing in biocontainment laboratories across various departments, creating both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, conducting offensive and defensive research. The Department of Defense (DOD) has modernized its laboratories since World War II, focusing on defensive research. President Nixon ended the offensive biological weapons program in 1969. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the only DOD location with BSL-4 lab space, with other sites having BSL-3 space. DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million investment. Various DOD labs have increased their BSL-3 capacity since 2001 for infectious disease research and testing of biological countermeasures. The Department of Homeland Security established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center at USAMRIID for analyzing pathogens to identify biological attack perpetrators. Permanent BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories are under construction in Frederick, MD, expected to be operational by 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now being replaced by the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas. NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focusing on animal pathogens research and countermeasures. The Department of Health and Human Services also maintains BSL-4 laboratories in Bethesda, MD, and Atlanta, GA. The Department of Health and Human Services has invested in constructing two BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and thirteen BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) in various locations across the United States. These facilities are intended to support research on pathogens for biodefense purposes and to assist in public health efforts during emergencies. Additionally, the HHS has established the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to coordinate laboratory responses to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The LRN is an integrated network of laboratories that respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others. These labs primarily focus on diagnostic and public health testing, especially in emergency situations requiring additional testing capacity. USDA is conducting research in the new NBAF and building new BSL-3 labs in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are investing in high-containment lab facilities to enhance faculty competitiveness for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Academic institutions are investing in high-containment laboratory space to enhance faculty competitiveness for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, product development, and manufacturing goals. Policymakers are facing challenges in determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, and balancing national needs. Policymakers are grappling with determining the right capacity for high-containment laboratories, increasing oversight, and balancing national needs. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, it was evident that existing infrastructure was insufficient, leading to the decision to construct more facilities with federal support. However, concerns exist about over-building capacity and the lack of a coordinated expansion plan. Policymakers are concerned about the excess capacity of high-containment laboratories compared to national needs. Information on existing laboratory capacity is lacking, hindering coordinated planning. Estimates vary, with DHS and HHS identifying 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, but this has been criticized. Registration with select agents does not necessarily indicate high-containment laboratory use. Entities registered to work with select agents may or may not use high-containment laboratories. Nongovernmental estimates show an increase in high-containment laboratory capability. The Government Accountability Office noted a rise in laboratories but couldn't determine the exact number of BSL-3 facilities. Coordinated planning involving multiple federal agencies is needed to assess if construction has exceeded national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will be necessary to fully utilize the additional capacity, especially for agencies experiencing a significant increase in high-containment laboratory capacity. Increased funding may be challenging for agencies experiencing a large increase in high-containment laboratory capacity, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs. Interagency federal planning efforts could help reduce overcapacity costs, but require agreement on prioritization and shared facility use. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies. Congress may need to consider conducting a survey to assess the utilization of existing or future facilities at the agency level. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Policymakers are reevaluating oversight frameworks, with some calling for more federal regulation and mandatory biosafety training. Some experts suggest expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories to include mandatory biosafety training and enhanced biosecurity measures. Others propose a self-regulatory approach focused on increased worker engagement and responsibility, with training in best practices and self-policing by scientists. The expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity allows for more diverse biodefense research and efficient public health testing, but also raises concerns about theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security of stored pathogens in response to these concerns. The Select Agent Program aims to improve physical security in high-containment facilities storing pathogens. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses, and regulatory focus on compliance could reduce risks. Despite planning, accidents can occur and overwhelm safety measures. Each facility has inherent risks, which increase with new constructions. The magnitude of incremental risk is hard to measure and depends on compliance with regulations and best practices. The incremental risk in high-containment laboratories is challenging to measure and varies based on compliance with regulations and best practices. Policymakers may conduct a cost/benefit analysis considering factors like accidental releases, subsequent illnesses, and the total number of laboratories. Benefits of research breakthroughs and costs of infectious releases are weighed, but subtle effects like national sampling networks may be overlooked. Policy decisions may be reactive to high-profile incidents rather than based on actual risks. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the potential for insider threats. The increase in trained technicians and scientists may also increase the risk of malicious intent. The DOJ has cited the 2001 anthrax mailings as an example of a government scientist using high-containment techniques for bioterrorism. The international community may view the expansion of high-containment capacity as excessive and potentially for offensive biological weapons. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about potential misuse for bioterrorism. International proliferation of such facilities may increase the risk of malevolent use of high-containment techniques and information. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact business decisions of pharmaceutical companies, potentially affecting national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or natural disease outbreaks. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of treatments may face restricted access during international crises. Differences in biosecurity regulations may hinder international collaborations and lead industry to invest in countries with perceived lower barriers. The impact of biosecurity regulations on research collaboration remains unclear. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has sparked local debate, with some supporting the economic benefits and job creation, while others raise concerns about public health and security risks. Policymakers are faced with addressing these conflicting viewpoints. Policymakers are considering options for oversight of high-containment laboratories, balancing security concerns with research productivity. There is debate over whether current efforts are sufficient or if additional action is needed. Some policymakers argue that current oversight of high-containment laboratories is adequate, while others believe additional measures could hinder research. Supporters of the status quo suggest focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists instead of implementing new regulations. Concerned policymakers may delay action to fully understand policy impacts. Policymakers may defer action on oversight of high-containment laboratories to await recommendations from expert groups created by the Bush Administration in 2005. These groups include the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States and the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity. Some policymakers may consider these efforts insufficient and may call for additional studies. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009. The Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States was established through an Executive Order on January 9, 2009. It consists of various government officials and is tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing laws and regulations related to biosafety and biosecurity. The HHS also formed the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight in December 2007 to address oversight gaps in high-containment laboratories. The task force, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various federal agencies and departments. It focuses on oversight of research at high-containment laboratories, addressing biosafety gaps, and providing recommendations. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research and biosafety training programs. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing high-containment laboratory issues and providing recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations or address the issue without waiting for reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories have been unsuccessful, with calls for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity from various sources. Multiple sources and commissions have called for a comprehensive inventory of non-federal high-containment laboratories, located in various institutions. Challenges include the difficulty of identifying existing facilities and concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government are potential solutions. One potential solution to the challenge of identifying high-containment laboratories is mandating registration with the federal government. This approach could create a comprehensive list of such facilities, providing information on capacity, use, and distribution. Another option is to limit the survey to federal facilities, requiring all agencies to report their high-containment facilities to Congress. This would allow for more efficient planning by policymakers. The government could efficiently plan for the use and expansion of federal high-containment facilities by conducting a government-wide needs assessment. Comparing the assessment with existing capacity can help determine if there is an overexpansion, which has resource allocation costs and security concerns. Congress may need to consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories and the quality of information acquired. A needs assessment from specific agencies or multiple agencies could be required to maximize the benefits of such a survey. In the absence of a government-wide needs assessment, policymakers are considering a moratorium on new federally funded high-containment laboratory construction to avoid over-building. Incremental increases in laboratory capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new space. Some agencies argue that existing laboratory space should be expanded instead of constructing new facilities, citing dated infrastructure as a reason. However, without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability, due to delays in planned research activities. The federal government may face delays in establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities due to a potential construction moratorium. Analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. One proposed approach is to apply Select Agent Program requirements to all high-containment laboratories for uniform security standards. Alternatively, licensing could take a different form. Licensing and certifying high-containment laboratories may face challenges in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment to ensure biosecurity for the use of select agents. Expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens not covered by current regulations could improve biosecurity oversight in high-containment laboratories. Some experts argue that diseases like SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever, which could be used as biological weapons, are not adequately regulated under the current system. Some pathogens causing diseases are considered biological weapons, leading to concerns about expanding the regulated select agent list. Scientists question the current taxonomic-based definition of select agents and suggest identifying them based on other features. This approach would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, limiting disruption to scientific development and public health activities. The government could focus regulatory efforts on high-containment laboratories posing the greatest risk by expanding background checks for personnel. Different levels of screening may be required for access to high-containment facilities without select agents, depending on the potential risks. Implementing enhanced personnel oversight may face challenges, including resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Facilities may pose implementation challenges, with potential resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may prefer to exit high-containment research fields rather than obtain required clearance. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs, but a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs and risks. Developing training standards could ensure core competencies for all trainees. The development of training standards for biosafety could help ensure core competencies for trainees, but there are concerns about the quality and effectiveness of current programs. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training to address biosecurity vulnerabilities and the dual-use nature of pathogens in high-containment laboratories. The impact of such training on reducing laboratory acquired infections is uncertain. Enhancing reporting mechanisms in high-containment laboratories can improve biosecurity by sharing lessons from accidents. However, fear of penalties or professional repercussions may hinder reporting. Experts recommend establishing a database of accidents and remedies to prevent future incidents. Establishing a database of accidents and corresponding remediation in high-containment laboratories is recommended to prevent future incidents. Experts suggest coupling this database with the reporting required under the Select Agent Program, with minimal penalties for reporting to encourage participation. Policymakers need to balance increasing oversight with potential regulatory burdens and resistance from stakeholders. Increased federal oversight may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. The benefits include reducing opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. Expanding the Select Agent Program could hinder public health response and international collaboration. Critics argue that the program's requirements may impede timely transfer of materials between laboratories. International collaboration on regulated pathogens may suffer due to differing security regimes. International collaboration on regulated pathogens may be hindered by a lack of comparable security regimes in foreign countries. The impacts of a licensing regime on scientists and public health laboratories could be significant, leading to reduced scientific productivity and increased costs. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency for regulated facilities is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being considered suitable regulators. Policymakers may need to consider shifting oversight of high-containment laboratories to agencies like DHS due to increased homeland security concerns. This could involve augmenting existing authorities or creating new ones, potentially leading to a mix of oversight responsibilities. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and deciding on consolidation of oversight into one agency could be crucial for smooth implementation. Limited federal resources have been allocated to overseeing biosafety practices, which are mainly voluntary. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address issues related to biosafety practices for high-containment laboratories. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. The National Academy of Sciences would review the program and recommend improvements, while the HHS Secretary would develop mandatory biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents. Additional funding and staffing may be necessary for agencies to meet new mandates. The HHS Secretary would develop minimum biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents. Guidance on monitoring and inventory procedures would be improved. Evaluation of capacity, sharing of lessons learned, and personnel training would be reported to Congress. A Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System would be established. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) would authorize grants for Regional Biocontainment Laboratories. The bill would authorize DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. A report to Congress would detail activities to integrate the RBL network and assess the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity. International harmonization of biocontainment technologies is crucial to address bioterror threats. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining enhanced oversight goals for high-containment laboratories. When considering policy options for high-containment laboratories, policymakers must balance security benefits with regulatory burdens, costs, and impacts on scientific progress. This involves reconciling competing national needs and potential conflicts."
