    "content": "Habeas corpus allows individuals in custody to petition for release if detention is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled on detainee rights, but has not granted relief to state prisoners claiming innocence. Legislation has been proposed to address these issues. Federal law limits habeas relief for finality, federalism, and efficiency reasons. The law imposes bars to habeas relief for finality, federalism, and efficiency reasons. One bar prohibits repetitious habeas petitions claiming a constitutionally defective state conviction. Newly discovered evidence of innocence may warrant relief, but freestanding claims of innocence have not been granted habeas relief by the Supreme Court. Legislation has been proposed to allow habeas relief based on actual innocence. The 111th Congress proposed bills to establish actual innocence as a basis for habeas relief, including the Effective Death Penalty Appeals Act (H.R. 3986) and the Justice for the Wrongfully Accused Act (H.R. 3320). H.R. 3986 aimed to allow second habeas petitions based on newly discovered evidence of innocence, with a probability standard favored by the Supreme Court. The Court favored a clear and convincing evidence standard in cases where the petitioner challenged not his conviction but claimed he was innocent of the aggravating factor that justified imposition of the death penalty. The statutory provisions now favor a clear and convincing evidence standard in the constitutional defect plus innocence exception to the second or successive petition bar. The Johnson bill would have released federal habeas courts from the binding impact of state court determinations in cases of probable innocence. The Johnson bill proposed releasing federal habeas courts from state court determinations in cases of probable innocence, but the 111th Congress adjourned without further action on the bill. The Moore bill focused on evidence establishing innocence for state prisoners, including those on death row, and eased limitations on filing second or successive habeas petitions while maintaining existing standards. The bill proposed changes to the requirements for filing habeas petitions based on new laws or newly discovered evidence of innocence. It aimed to allow petitions without appellate court approval in cases of actual innocence supported by forensic testing, withheld evidence, or witness recantations. Additionally, it sought to permit courts to consider forensic evidence, exculpatory evidence, and official misconduct in support of claims of innocence. The Moore bill proposed changes to habeas petition requirements, allowing petitions for actual innocence without appellate court approval. It aimed to consider forensic evidence, witness recantations, and official misconduct in support of innocence claims. The bill also addressed the bar for failure to exhaust state remedies. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on the bill. The proposals introduced by various representatives and senators included the Military Commissions Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2009, Interrogation and Detention Reform Act of 2008, Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2009, Terrorist Detainees Procedures Act of 2009, Detainment Reform Act of 2009, and Terrorist Detention Review Reform Act. These proposals were in response to the Boumediene v. Bush case, which granted foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo the right to habeas corpus. The Military Commissions Act stripped federal courts of habeas jurisdiction for foreign enemy combatant detainees, which was deemed unconstitutional by the Court. Various bills aimed to repeal this provision. Various bills were proposed in the 111th Congress to repeal the provision of the Military Commissions Act that stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over habeas petitions from Guantanamo detainees. The bills aimed to establish new habeas provisions and review procedures for detained enemy combatants, threatening individuals, and unprivileged enemy belligerents. However, the Congress adjourned without taking further action on these proposals. Witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee's habeas hearings criticized aspects of federal habeas law that were not addressed in the legislative proposals. Witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee's habeas hearings criticized the impact of the one-year statute of limitations in federal habeas law and the complexity of provisions that can be fatal if tardy. They also expressed concern over the binding effect given to state court determinations of federal law. Chief Justice Kogan and Mr. Hanlon were critical of the \"opt in\" provisions for streamlined habeas procedures in capital cases, with Chief Justice Kogan advocating for their repeal and Mr. Hanlon suggesting that the role of gatekeeper be returned to federal courts. Mr. Hanlon recommended returning the role of gatekeeper to federal courts and federal funding for capital defender organizations. Chief Justice Kogan also had concerns about the Teague rule, harmless error, and deference to state fact finding in the death penalty system. Chief Justice Kogan expressed concerns about the interpretation of constitutional law in relation to habeas treatment of harmless constitutional errors committed at the state level. He highlighted the incongruity between sections 2254(e)(1) and 2254(d)(2) in the context of state court findings. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on these matters."
