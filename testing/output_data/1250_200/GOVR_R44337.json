    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income, benefiting farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. The positive ripple effects of U.S. food and fiber trade extend to farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and industries providing seed, fertilizer, and machinery. Rising farm productivity and market-oriented policies drive interest in liberalizing agricultural trade among TPP countries. TPP countries account for a significant portion of U.S. agricultural exports. Between 2011 and 2015, U.S. agricultural exports to TPP countries averaged $63.5 billion, while imports from these countries amounted to $60.9 billion. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 aimed to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, potentially enhancing competitiveness. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report in May 2016 on the economic impact of the agreement, including on agriculture and food sectors. Four key considerations about the TPP agreement relevant to U.S. food and agriculture are highlighted. The TPP agreement aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products. Key considerations include the lack of free trade agreements with five TPP countries, with Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia offering the most potential for boosting exports. Industry reactions, provisions beyond market access, and actions needed for the agreement to enter into force are also discussed. The three countries with the greatest potential for boosting U.S. farm and food exports via lower tariffs in the TPP agreement are Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. These countries have higher agricultural tariffs than the United States, which could benefit U.S. exports as tariffs decline. Japan is seen as the leading market opportunity due to its protected markets and high GDP, while Vietnam is also a significant market with a fast-growing economy. Vietnam, with the fourth-largest population in the TPP and a fast-growing economy, is viewed as a market that could hold significant future growth potential for U.S. farm and food products. Preferential access that U.S. food and agricultural interests have to markets in Canada and Mexico under NAFTA would become available to a wider group of potential competitors over time as tariffs are lowered within the TPP zone. U.S. rice growers are concerned about potential loss of exports to Mexico as tariffs on Vietnamese rice are lowered under TPP. Export expansion opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural interests, such as beef and pork to Japan and dairy products to Japan, Canada, and Vietnam, are to be phased in over a period of years. If the United States does not implement the TPP agreement, U.S. agricultural export competitors could gain a competitive edge in Japan and elsewhere. Australia already enjoys preferential tariff rates on beef exports to Japan compared to the U.S. TPP would level the playing field for U.S. beef in Japan. The European Union is not part of the TPP but could potentially ratify a similar agreement without U.S. participation. The TPP agreement aims to level the playing field for U.S. beef in Japan, where Australia currently enjoys preferential tariff rates. The European Union is not part of the TPP but is negotiating FTAs that could enhance its competitive position in certain markets. The agreement does not address domestic subsidy regimes, which are typically handled in multilateral trade negotiations. The ITC report concluded that TPP would benefit U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding market access. The ITC report mandated by the trade promotion authority legislation (P.L. 114-26) projects TPP outcomes for U.S. agriculture in year 15 (2032). Results show U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%), while agricultural imports would rise by $2.7 billion (1.5%). U.S. dairy product exports would grow by $1.85 billion (18%), processed foods and beef would see gains of $1.54 billion (3.8%) and $875 million (8.4%) respectively. However, corn and rice exports may decrease. U.S. imports of processed foods, beef, and dairy products are projected to increase with TPP, primarily due to lower tariffs and expanded market access. The TPP agreement would boost U.S. agricultural exports by $7.2 billion, with significant gains in Japan and Vietnam. The American Farm Bureau Federation predicts a $4.4 billion increase in farm income annually with TPP. Support for TPP in the food and agriculture industry is widespread but not unanimous. The TPP agreement would impact market access for various agricultural commodities and food products. Japan would reduce tariffs on beef over a 16-year period, with the U.S. eliminating tariffs on beef and pork within 15 years. Vietnam would also eliminate tariffs on beef products over three to eight years. Japan, the leading market for U.S. pork exports, would cut tariffs on pork cuts immediately to 2.2% and phase out residual tariffs over nine years. A special safeguard would allow temporary duty increases if imports exceed a trigger level. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork products within 10 years, while the U.S. would immediately eliminate most tariffs. Canada would gradually increase access to its poultry and egg markets over five years. Under the TPP agreement, Canada would gradually increase access to its highly protected poultry and egg markets over five years through new duty-free TRQs. Vietnamese tariffs on poultry would be eliminated within 13 years, while U.S. tariffs would be eliminated within 10 years. In terms of dairy, Canada would allow incremental additional access to its dairy product markets over five years, amounting to 3.25% of its output for 2016 under TRQs. Canada would gradually increase access to its dairy product markets over a period of 14 to 19 years under the TPP agreement. This additional access would amount to about 0.3% of current U.S. milk production and would be open to all TPP countries. In-quota dairy products would enter Canada duty-free, and Canada would eliminate its over-quota tariff on whey powder over 10 years. Japan and the United States would also eliminate tariffs on certain dairy products within 16 to 21 years. The United States would establish TRQs for dairy products from Australia and New Zealand, gradually phasing out tariffs and increasing TRQs for Canadian dairy products annually until year 19 of the agreement. Under the TPP agreement, Canada would gradually increase access to its dairy product markets over 14 to 19 years. This would include duty-free entry for in-quota dairy products and the elimination of tariffs on certain dairy products by Japan and the United States within 16 to 21 years. Additionally, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the US would make changes to tariffs on corn, soybeans, and wheat products. Japan would eliminate tariffs on soybean products within 10 years and lower government-imposed markups on wheat over nine years. A new duty-free quota for U.S. wheat would be established, along with new quotas for processed wheat products. Vietnam and Malaysia would also eliminate tariffs on certain products within a few years. Japan would establish new TPP-wide TRQs for wheat products and wheat-based food preparations, with Vietnam and Malaysia eliminating tariffs on certain products within a few years. Japan would also establish a new TPP-wide TRQ for barley, with progressive reductions in tariffs and new duty-free quotas for U.S. unroasted and roasted malt. Additionally, Japan would establish a duty-free quota for U.S. rice, starting at 50,000 tons and rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. The TPP agreement includes new duty-free quotas for U.S. rice in Japan, starting at 50,000 tons and rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. Japan would also eliminate tariffs on certain fresh and dried nuts immediately, including almonds, walnuts, and pecans. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on cotton within four years. Tariffs on fresh and dried nuts would be adjusted, with tariffs on almonds at 2.4%, walnuts at 10%, and pecans at 4.5%. Vietnam would reduce tariffs on walnuts and almonds over three years. Japan would lower tariffs on oranges over six to eight years, with a safeguard in place. Tariffs on grapefruit and orange juice would be phased out in six to eight years. In Japan, tariffs on fresh apples would be reduced by 25% immediately and eliminated over 10 years. Tariffs on fresh cherries would be halved upon agreement entry and phased out in five years. Tariffs on fresh grapes, raisins, and various other fruits would be eliminated immediately or over a few years. Vietnam and Malaysia would also reduce tariffs on various fruits. The United States would eliminate tariffs on various fruits immediately, including fresh apricots, cherries, mangoes, papayas, peaches, pears, plums, and strawberries. Additionally, new duty-free quotas for sugar would be established, with Australia and Canada receiving the majority of the quotas. Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam would also expand access to their markets for sugar and sweetener-related products. Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam would expand market access for sugar and sweetener-related products. U.S. tariffs on tobacco would be eliminated within 10 years, while Japan and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on smoking tobacco and cigars over 11 years. Vietnam would create a TRQ for unmanufactured tobacco imports and eliminate tariffs on tobacco products over time. A controversy has emerged over a provision in the Exceptions chapter of the agreement. The TPP agreement includes a provision allowing countries to deny protections under ISDS to tobacco product manufacturers for claims related to tobacco control measures. This exclusion could potentially impact sales of leaf tobacco. The agreement also addresses market access for various farm commodity groups and includes a timetable for tariff elimination for food and agricultural products in specific TPP markets. Additionally, the agreement covers trade-related measures beyond tariffs and TRQs that are important to producers and exporters of food and agricultural products. The TPP agreement includes provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, and biotechnology that benefit U.S. agriculture. It outlines rules of origin, criteria for determining TPP origin of agricultural products, and eligibility for preferential tariff rates. The TPP agreement outlines rules of origin for agricultural products, including criteria for determining TPP origin. A de minimis provision allows goods to be considered of TPP origin if non-TPP content is under 10% of the transactional value. Exceptions to this rule include certain agricultural goods like dairy products, edible oil-bearing crops, citrus juices, and non-TPP fruits. The TPP agreement addresses non-tariff barriers to trade, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) related to food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It goes beyond the WTO SPS agreement in areas such as risk assessment, transparency, and rapid response to export issues. The agreement includes commitments to base SPS measures on international standards or scientific evidence, manage risks without unnecessary trade distortion, and allow for public comment on development. The TPP agreement includes commitments to base SPS measures on international standards or scientific evidence, manage risks without unnecessary trade distortion, and allow for public comment on development. It also requires rapid notification of shipments held on importation and outlines a dispute resolution process. Additionally, the agreement promotes transparency and information sharing on agricultural biotechnology products to minimize disruptions to trade. The TPP agreement promotes transparency and information sharing on agricultural biotechnology products to minimize disruptions to trade. Importers and exporters exchange information to minimize LLP occurrences and establish a working group on agricultural biotechnology within the TPP Committee on Agricultural Trade. Parties are not obligated to adopt or modify laws related to biotechnology. Geographical Indications protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. Geographical Indications (GIs) are mainly used for wines, spirits, and agricultural products like Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs have sparked controversy in international trade as some consider them protected property while others see them as generic names. For example, \"feta\" is a protected GI in the EU but considered generic in the US. The TPP agreement requires members to recognize GIs and provide a transparent process for objections and cancellations. The TPP agreement requires parties to adopt a procedure for objecting to the recognition of Geographical Indications (GIs). Reasons for opposing a GI include potential confusion with a trademark, pending applications, or if the term is the customary name in the country. For wines and spirits, members are not obligated to recognize a GI if it is the same as a grape variety name in their territory. Criteria for determining customary common names include usage in dictionaries, newspapers, websites, and trade references. Members must provide information on GIs from other international agreements and allow objections. The TPP agreement requires parties to provide information on Geographical Indications (GIs) from other agreements and allow objections. It also includes commitments to eliminate export subsidies and limit restrictions on food and agricultural exports. The agreement aims to set standards for future reform on a multilateral basis. The TPP agreement limits restrictions on food and agricultural exports to 6 months, with consultation required for restrictions lasting over 12 months. The TBT chapter includes annexes relevant to food and agriculture, such as parameters for labeling wines and distilled spirits and proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives. The TPP agreement does not require disclosure of wine-making practices on labels unless for health or safety reasons. It also addresses proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives, encouraging cooperation on organic product regulations among TPP members. Numerous food and agricultural organizations have expressed support for the TPP agreement since its issuance on November 5, 2015. These include the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and others. Several agricultural organizations, including the Users Association, United Fresh Produce Association, U.S. Dairy Export Council, U.S. Grains Council, U.S. Wheat Associates, and Wine Institute, along with Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATACs), provided input on the TPP agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables endorsed the TPP, with members from various industry groups such as the Almond Board of California, Florida Tomato Exchange, and National Pecan Growers Council. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners and Sweetener Products also supported the TPP, meeting Congress's negotiating objectives under TPA (P.L. 114-26). The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised aspects of the TPP agreement, highlighting new market access opportunities and enhanced SPS commitments. However, it did not endorse TPP outright due to criticisms such as inadequate dairy product TRQs from Canada and Japan and a product-specific exception for tobacco products. Opponents of TPP include the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, U.S. Rice Producers Association, and UFCW, citing concerns about enforcement mechanisms. The UFCW criticizes the TPP agreement for lacking an enforcement mechanism against currency manipulation, which could lead to job losses in the US. USA Rice has not taken a stance on the agreement. Trade ministers from 12 countries signed the TPP agreement on February 4, 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect, with a 90-day window for a vote without amendments."
