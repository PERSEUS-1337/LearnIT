Diabetes self-management training is crucial for patients to effectively manage their condition, provided by certified educators. Diabetes self-management training, provided by certified educators, has been proven effective in reducing risks and complications. Lifestyle changes can significantly decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially in older individuals. Certified diabetes educators play a crucial role in helping patients control their diabetes and improve their health. Lifestyle changes taught by these educators lead to better glycemic control and reduced complications. Proper medical treatment and self-management can prevent serious complications of diabetes by up to 90% for blindness, 85% for amputations, and 50% for heart disease and stroke. There are over 20,000 diabetes educators in the US, most of whom are certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. Certified diabetes educators, licensed by a State as health professionals, are uniquely qualified to provide diabetes self-management training under the Medicare program. They must meet specific professional credentials, have years of experience in diabetes self-management training, pass a national examination, and renew their credentials periodically.
