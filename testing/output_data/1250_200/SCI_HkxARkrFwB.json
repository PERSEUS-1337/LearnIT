    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a lot of space, leading to memory constraints. Two efficient methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed to store word embedding matrices during training and inference. These methods achieve a significant reduction in storage space without compromising accuracy in NLP tasks. Word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe are used in deep learning NLP models to represent words as continuous vectors. These vectors, of dimensionality p much smaller than the vocabulary size d, capture semantic relationships between words and reduce the width of neural network layers needed for processing. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix needs to be stored in GPU memory for efficient access during training and inference. Vocabulary sizes can be large, reaching d = 10^5 or 10^6, and the dimensionality of embeddings used in current systems is crucial for effective NLP tasks. The dimensionality of word embeddings in NLP models ranges from p = 300 to p = 1024, stored in GPU memory for efficient access. Quantum computing uses qubits interconnected to achieve exponential state space dimensionality, allowing for entanglement, a purely quantum phenomenon. The curr_chunk discusses the representation of quantum entanglement in quantum computing and its application in storing word embedding matrices efficiently for NLP machine learning algorithms. The methods proposed, word2ket and word2ketXS, operate on word embeddings to enhance processing efficiency. The loss of representation power in classical approximation approaches does not significantly impact NLP algorithms. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with little impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. A tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W, denoted as V \u2297 W, is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The tensor product space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, forming an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k } in V \u2297 W. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensionalities of V and W, and tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is represented as |u, with a countable orthonormal basis. In quantum computing, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is represented as |u, called a ket. The tensor product space contains vectors v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. Tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. In quantum computing, tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is not known. A word embedding model maps word identifiers into a real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. Embeddings of individual words are represented as entangled tensors in word2ket, using a tensor of rank r and order n. In quantum computing, tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. The word embedding model represents embeddings of individual words as entangled tensors in word2ket, using a tensor of rank r and order n. The calculation of inner product between word embeddings takes O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. The total space requirement for processing embedding vectors in a batch is O(bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O(rn log^2 p) time. The proposed word2ket representation involves a balanced tensor product tree for efficient parallel processing of word embeddings. This structure allows for O(log2n) linear layers with linear activation functions. Gradients with respect to individual elements can be defined, but the high Lipschitz constant of the gradient poses a challenge. The balanced tensor product tree for word embeddings involves using LayerNorm to address the high Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Linear operators A and B map vectors from V to U and W to Y respectively. The tensor product of A and B is a linear operator mapping vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. In a p-dimensional word embedding model, a linear operator F maps a one-hot vector to the corresponding word embedding vector. The text discusses a word embedding model using a linear operator to map one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. It introduces a matrix representation of the linear operator and explains how tensor product-based exponential compression is applied to the embedding matrix for space efficiency. The method utilizes a balanced binary tree structure to avoid reconstructing the full embedding matrix each time. The text introduces space-efficient word embeddings using lazy tensors to avoid reconstructing the full embedding matrix for downstream NLP tasks like text summarization, language translation, and question answering. The proposed embeddings are compared with regular embeddings in terms of accuracy in these tasks. In text summarization experiments, word2ket embeddings achieved a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. The encoder-decoder architecture used had internal layers with a dimensionality of 256 and dropout rate of 0.2, trained for 20 epochs. Different dimensionality values were explored, but word2ketXS proved to be more space-efficient while maintaining similar scores to word2ket. In text summarization experiments, word2ket achieved a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. On the other hand, word2ketXS offered over 100-fold space reduction while maintaining similar scores to word2ket. The evaluation then focused on word2ketXS for further NLP tasks. The study evaluated the use of word2ketXS embeddings for NLP tasks, achieving significant space savings with minimal impact on performance. The model used a 3-layer bidirectional LSTM with 128 hidden units and reported a slight drop in F1 score for a 1000-fold reduction in parameter space. Training time increased when using word2ketXS embeddings, but the space savings were substantial. The training time for 40 epochs increased when using word2ketXS-based model with order 2 and order 4 tensors, taking 7.4 and 9 hours respectively. The memory footprint of word embeddings decreased significantly, impacting the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require millions of parameters, with 30% belonging to word embeddings. Sparse Transformers, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 require millions of parameters, with a significant portion dedicated to word embeddings. To reduce memory requirements, various approaches like dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, and bit encoding have been proposed. An optimized method for quantization of floating point numbers in the embedding matrix has also been suggested. Bit encoding methods have been proposed for compressing models for low-memory inference, with approaches like pruning, quantization, sparsity, and low numerical precision also being utilized. Fourier-based approximation methods have been used for approximating matrices, but word2ketXS achieves higher space saving rates. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. The vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality limit the use of tensor product spaces in document embeddings. Arora et al. (2018) utilized sketching of a tensor to represent n-grams in documents."
