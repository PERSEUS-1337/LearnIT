Major highlights include implementing standards-based assessments in reading, mathematics, and science, providing grants for assessment development, requiring states to participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress tests, and applying adequate yearly progress standards. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) extended and amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) by implementing standards-based assessments in reading, mathematics, and science, applying adequate yearly progress (AYP) standards, and introducing consequences for schools and LEAs that fail to meet AYP standards. Additionally, ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas were modified to target high-poverty LEAs and move Puerto Rico towards parity with the states. New programs for reading instruction and teacher recruitment were initiated, and requirements for paraprofessionals paid with Title I-A funds were established. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 expanded the Elementary and Secondary Education Act by implementing standards-based assessments and consequences for schools. It also included provisions for teacher recruitment, professional development, and funding transfers among programs. Additionally, federal support for public school choice was increased, and various education programs were consolidated into state grants. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program was converted into a formula grant with a focus on after-school activities. The Senate bill includes provisions for mandatory funding for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B grants, discipline provisions for children with disabilities, authorization for states to eliminate program requirements for increased accountability, and pest management in schools. Both House and Senate versions include aggregate performance bonuses or sanctions for states. Comparisons of major features of the NCLB and relevant provisions of previous law are provided in a table."
