    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Technology Retraining and Investment Now Act for the 21st Century\". The Congress finds that the value added by workers in the US and other countries is increasingly dependent on educational and training investments. There is a disparity in investment between the US and its trading partners, leading to declining educational performance in the US. This makes it challenging for US businesses to fund worker education compared to other countries. The global workforce environment creates competitive pressures on domestic companies to utilize highly educated knowledge workers from other countries. It is in the interest of the United States government to reverse this trend while maintaining trade obligations and global competitiveness. Public-private partnerships in the US help advance the needs of citizens, businesses, and communities, such as the research and development tax credit. Businesses are best suited to train the workforce for available jobs and improve cost effectiveness. The Act aims to encourage businesses and individuals to support the educational development of knowledge workers in the United States by providing incentives for information and communications technology education and training investments. This is crucial as a substantial number of baby boomers are retiring, and the US needs to train its workforce for high-paying technology jobs to support benefit programs for retirees. Additionally, mature workers should be incentivized to retrain for new jobs after retirement. The Act aims to encourage businesses and individuals to support educational development for knowledge workers in the United States by providing incentives for training investments in fields like information technology, engineering, and manufacturing. This will help businesses utilize training dollars more effectively and maximize the skills of newly trained individuals. SEC. 30D.
