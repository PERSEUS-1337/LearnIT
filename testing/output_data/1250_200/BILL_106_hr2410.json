The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 is amended to reserve a minimum of $150,000,000 for grants under subpart 2 each fiscal year.

GRANTS TO REDUCE DRUG USE AND TRANSACTIONS IN SCHOOL ZONES. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 is amended to include Subpart 2 - Drug-Free School Zone Enforcement, with provisions for state allotments. State allotments are determined for each fiscal year based on the school-aged population of each state and the amount received under part A of title I in the previous year. No state shall receive less than one-half of 1 percent of the total amount allotted. The Secretary may reallot funds if a state cannot utilize them within two years. State grants are provided for drug-free school zone enforcement under SEC. 4122. State Department of Justice or equivalent agency must submit an application to the Secretary to receive funding under SEC. 4121. The application must include assurances and any other required information. Funds must be used to make subgrants to local government units, with at least 95 percent of the allotment allocated for this purpose. The government receiving a subgrant must use funds to reduce drug-related activities near schools by hiring law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and coordinating with drug enforcement agencies. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of the total amount allotted for each fiscal year. The definitions in this subpart clarify that \"State\" refers to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, while \"unit of local government\" is defined as per the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968."
