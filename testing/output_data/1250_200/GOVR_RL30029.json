    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming predominant in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The term \"Nilotic\" to describe people today has fallen out of favor due to intermingling with Bantu and Nilo-Saharan speakers. Bantu agriculture was not suited to southern Africa's climate, where the Khoisan or San people lived. By 500 BC, the Bantu had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. African farmers grew a variety of crops, including bananas from contacts with the Indian Ocean region. They also had cattle, but the tsetse fly limited their presence in central Africa. After the discovery of America, African farmers adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, exchanging goods with pastoralists in dry regions like Kenya's Rift Valley. Large towns and cities did not develop in Africa due to disease-causing organisms. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent in pre-colonial Africa, with broadly similar languages spoken over wide areas correlating with cultural practices and religious beliefs. African loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships, rather than large ethnic groups. Powerful individuals or chiefs emerged, consolidating authority through conquest and alliance. African kingdoms developed, such as the Kongo kingdom to the south of the Congo River estuary. Great artistic achievements characterized these pre-colonial kingdoms, including naturalistic bronze castings in Benin and Congolese masks that inspired modern artists like Picasso. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, lasting 400 years and resulting in 10-13 million Africans being taken, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak occurred in the 18th century, with annual totals reaching 100,000. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. The Atlantic slave trade was conducted by European traders based on the West African coast, purchasing slaves from African owners with various goods. Slavery had long been practiced in Africa, where captives from wars, criminals, and others were enslaved. Some individuals sold into the trade were also kidnap victims. The Atlantic slave trade involved kidnap victims being sold into slavery. Historians note that treatment of slaves in traditional African societies was generally less harsh than in the New World. The trade led to turmoil, warfare, and instability in West Africa, fueled by the exchange of slaves for guns. This weakened Africa and made it vulnerable to European colonization. Prior to 1870, European powers showed no signs of leaving their coastal positions in Africa. Instead, it was expected that indigenous political entities would strengthen and evolve into nation-states. The kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and a national language, while Buganda in East Africa was known for its powerful king, strong army, and growing trade. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were also emerging, particularly in Muslim societies, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. Islam had been slowly spreading in West Africa through trade contacts and had made significant gains in northeastern Africa through trade and Arab immigration. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread rapidly in West Africa through holy wars, creating a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto in modern Nigeria. Meanwhile, in East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar and Egypt were extending their power. In southern Africa, the Boers established a secondary empire to escape British cultural influences. In the 19th and 18th centuries, Boers migrated into the African interior to avoid British influence. They defeated the Zulu using modern weapons and established farms in depopulated areas. The European scramble for Africa began in the 1870s, leading to European control over sub-Saharan Africa by 1920, except for Ethiopia and Liberia. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization, defeating them at Adowa in 1896. Menelik II defeated Italian troops at Adowa in 1896, but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. The European scramble for Africa was aided by advances in medicine and military technology, giving them advantages over African forces. Many Africans did not resist colonization due to Europe's military superiority, although some groups like the Ashanti and Zulu did launch armed struggles. European powers, driven by imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests, colonized Africa for financial gains and resource exploitation. The discovery of diamonds in South Africa and gold in Johannesburg further fueled expansion. Germany sought agricultural potential in Tanganyika for raw cotton. At the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, King Leopold II of Belgium successfully gained recognition for his International Association of the Congo (IAC), which controlled Congo and was described as his \"one-man enterprise.\" Leopold's plans were supported by U.S. President Chester Arthur and a Senate resolution. The conference aimed to set rules for future acquisition of territories in Africa. The Berlin conference in 1884-1885 set rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, limiting colonization to Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also secured territories in Angola and Mozambique. By World War I, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa, with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt. The United States did not have colonies in Africa but assisted in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers established the Republic of Liberia in 1822 after struggles with disease and local warriors. They later used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the president, sparking a decade of political violence and a civil war. The effects of colonialism in Africa, particularly Leopold's rule in Congo, were notably negative. The abuses in Congo under Leopold's rule were widespread, including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. The international scandal led to the Belgian government taking control in 1908 and implementing reforms. Colonialism in British and French territories brought infrastructure improvements, public health standards, and some education opportunities, with Christian missions playing a key role in promoting literacy and education. European investment in Africa was limited, with colonial governments expecting colonies to pay for their own development. The colonial state heavily influenced the economy, regulating crops, prices, and investment. This led to post-independence statist systems hindering market economies. Africa became dependent on exporting primary products for manufactured goods, with prices of primary products performing poorly. The colonial state in Africa was authoritarian and not focused on promoting democracy. Colonial regimes imprisoned critics and set precedents for post-colonial rulers. Political participation was limited until the end of the colonial period. Britain and France worked closely with traditional authorities to obtain labor and tax revenues. During the colonial era, colonial authorities worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation strengthened traditional authorities, leading to issues of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices also intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. Europeans viewed the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" encouraging Africans to do the same. The British, in particular, ruled indirectly through tribal chiefs, further solidifying tribal identities. Africans found it advantageous to work through tribal organizations for their interests during this time. During the colonial era, Africans found it advantageous to work through tribal organizations to advance their interests, strengthening tribal loyalties. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundary divisions, weakening political institutions and economies. The Europeans suppressed indigenous political arrangements, hindering the development of pre-colonial political entities in ways that could have minimized the problems facing African states today. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, weakening Britain and France. The war emphasized democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government and free political institutions in their territories. Africans educated abroad during the 1930s returned to Africa after the war. After World War II, Africans educated abroad in the 1930s returned to Africa and organized opposition to colonial regimes. Influenced by European intellectual currents and socialist ideas, they were inspired by revolutionary movements in Asia and the struggle for social justice by black Americans. British policymakers foresaw independence for African colonies in the future, while France pursued assimilation policies for its colonies. Individual Africans could become French citizens through education, as seen with Leopold Senghor, future President of Senegal. In the 1950s, nationalist sentiments were rising in Africa, leading to anti-colonial protests and independence movements. British colonies like Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence in the early 1960s. French colonies also saw political parties organizing for independence, with Guinea choosing independence over association with France in 1958. This prompted France to grant independence to 14 African countries in 1960. In the 1960s, independence movements in Africa led to the emergence of 14 independent countries from French-held Africa. Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960. In southern Africa, white populations delayed independence, leading to armed struggles for freedom. Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, facing UN sanctions and civil war before becoming Zimbabwe in 1980. Angola and Mozambique gained independence in 1975 after Portuguese rule ended. Namibia also saw armed struggle for independence. In the 1960s, Mozambique gained independence in 1975 after Portuguese rule ended. Namibia achieved independence in 1990 following a U.N.-supervised election. In South Africa, apartheid was imposed in 1948 by the National Party, leading to protests and violent resistance in the 1970s and 1980s. The government responded with repression and military strikes against the opposition African National Congress. In the late 1980s, South Africa's white-controlled government faced international isolation due to apartheid. Secret discussions with the ANC led to constitutional negotiations, and universal-suffrage elections were held in 1994, with Nelson Mandela becoming President. In the early 1960s, western and eastern Africa saw a promising future with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new African elite. In the early 1960s, African countries expected faster growth with the construction of infrastructure. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity. However, conflicts and coups plagued the region, including civil war in the Congo and Nigeria. Ethnic tensions in Nigeria led to a civil war that lasted until 1970. In the aftermath of a coup in Nigeria, ethnic tensions escalated, leading to a civil war with the Ibo people attempting to secede. Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth plummeted in the 1970s and 1980s, with many countries under authoritarian regimes and experiencing violent conflicts. Civil wars erupted in Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Chad, Angola, and Mozambique, exacerbated by drought in 1982-1984. The colonial legacy of ethnic divisions, authoritarian rule, and economic interference has been cited as underlying causes of Africa's post-independence challenges. The impact of the colonial era on Africa is blamed for ethnic divisions, authoritarian rule, and economic interference. Colleges and universities were established late in the colonial period, leaving a small indigenous elite to face the challenges of independence. Africa faced a population challenge with a significant increase from 1950 to 1990. The Cold War also contributed to Africa's problems by fueling conflicts with arms from the Soviet Union and the United States supporting anti-Soviet regimes. This competitive involvement strengthened anti-democratic governments on both sides. France's policy in Africa during the Cold War aimed to maintain great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies, providing military and economic assistance, and promising intervention to protect friendly regimes. French businesses also gained privileged access to trade in these regions. In the later 1980s and early 1990s, scholars focused on African state weaknesses, blaming corruption, personal ambitions of leaders, ethnic favoritism, and \"pathological patrimonialism\" for hindering societal change and economic development. In the early 1990s, Africa faced challenges due to corrupt state institutions, personal ambitions of leaders, and economic difficulties. Despite some positive developments, such as the end of the Cold War and changes in South Africa, the continent struggled with low GDP growth and ongoing conflicts. The mid-1990s saw positive economic and political reforms in several African countries, with GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates. Political reforms were also underway, including the emergence of multiple political parties and free and fair elections. These developments were well-received by analysts. In the 1990s, African countries saw positive economic and political reforms, with free and fair elections being held. Analysts initially reacted favorably to these developments, but later expressed disappointment as some authoritarian leaders manipulated the electoral process to maintain power, creating \"pseudo-democracies.\" Richard Joseph noted that Africa's democratic opening resulted in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in the early 2000s were discouraging for advocates of democratization. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from elections led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, political violence marred the 2000 elections, and government actions against white-owned farms raised concerns about the rule of law. Additionally, the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa was intensifying according to a United Nations update in December 2000. The AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is worsening, with 25.3 million people infected with HIV in the region. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa are high, with some countries having over 20% of the adult population HIV-positive. The ongoing armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also a major concern. The ongoing armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its neighboring countries, have set back development prospects, created serious refugee problems, and raised fears of wider war. Economic performance in Africa remains disappointing, with low GDP growth rates and a marginalized position in the global economy. The marginalized position of Africa in the global economy is a concern for many, with predictions of increasing international marginalization due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Some argue against this pessimistic view, stating that Afro-pessimism overlooks the potential for growth and development in the continent. Many observers reject Afro-pessimism, arguing that Africa is experiencing positive changes such as governments becoming more accountable, economic empowerment, and progress in addressing challenges. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges past economic stagnation but sees potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki and others promote the idea of an African Renaissance. The African Renaissance concept is endorsed by various optimists who highlight positive political developments in Africa, such as successful democratic transitions in South Africa and Nigeria. They emphasize the wave of elections in the region as a significant step towards establishing democratic norms. The African Renaissance concept is supported by optimists who see a wave of elections in Africa as paving the way for further democratization and economic growth. Optimists believe that with economic policy reforms, improved governance, and international support, many African countries could see an increase in per capita incomes and quality of life. Debt relief and the continent's natural resources also contribute to a brighter future. The Clinton Administration had a positive outlook towards Africa. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa had an Afro-optimist tone, with President Clinton making extensive trips to the continent in 1998 and 2000. He praised Africa's progress in democratization and economic growth, highlighting countries like Nigeria for their cooperation with the United States. President Clinton praised Nigeria for its progress in democratization and cooperation with the United States. He emphasized combating the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and highlighted Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, especially in oil imports. The Administration endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act for increased trade and investment in Africa, citing other interests such as preventing weapons proliferation and combating the drug trade. The Administration launched various Africa assistance initiatives, including the Leland Initiative to improve Internet access and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative to address food insecurity. In July 1999, the LIFE Initiative was introduced to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic globally. Despite encountering difficulties, the Administration's efforts involved multiple U.S. agencies and boosted their Africa-related capabilities. The Administration's Africa-related initiatives faced challenges, notably the loss of U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. This led to hesitation in sending peacekeepers during the Rwanda genocide. Efforts were made to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through initiatives like the Africa Crisis Response Initiative and training Nigerian battalions for peacekeeping duties. U.S. officials also played mediator roles in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2000 being highlighted as a success. The peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2000 was seen as a success by U.S. officials. Trade results during the Clinton years showed mixed growth rates for imports and exports with Africa, with most trade focused on oil producers and South Africa. Despite this, U.S. firms had made significant investments in Africa. The U.S. foreign direct investment in the petroleum sector in Africa was about 1.2%. U.S. firms had made major investments in Africa, including Southwestern Bell's acquisition in the telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa became a focus in foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. Controversies over Africa policy have centered on issues like apartheid, African development, and Soviet/Cuban involvement. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion. During the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, the United States supported African nationalists and backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa. The focus was on Congo (Zaire), where covert aid was provided to suppress communist-inspired rebellions. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus of Africa policy shifted to southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose over policymakers' perceived sympathy towards white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing aggressive policies in Africa. Congress banned further involvement in Angola in 1975, with Kissinger accusing them of avoiding confrontation with Soviet expansionism. President Jimmy Carter's Administration emphasized human rights in foreign policy, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe. President Jimmy Carter's Administration focused on human rights in U.S. foreign policy, pushing for majority rule in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia. The Administration also criticized apartheid in South Africa and pressed for reforms in Zaire. In response to Soviet and Cuban influence in sub-Saharan Africa, ties were forged with Somalia, leading to the 1977-1978 \"Ogaden War\" when Somalia invaded Ethiopia. Cuba and Ethiopia launched a successful counteroffensive. During the Reagan Administration, Cuban troops were involved in Angola, supporting the Marxist regime against the UNITA resistance movement. The U.S. supported covert aid to UNITA, with a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement was achieved in 1988 under U.S. leadership. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, attention shifted to the Horn of Africa. In Ethiopia, rebel forces were on the brink of overthrowing the regime in 1991, leading to a peaceful transition facilitated by Bush Administration diplomats. However, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, resulting in a humanitarian disaster by 1992. As a response, Bush sent U.S. troops for a massive humanitarian intervention, credited with saving thousands despite American casualties. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, U.S. troops were sent for a massive humanitarian intervention in Somalia, credited with saving thousands despite American casualties. Additionally, Congress passed various acts such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act to promote democracy, economic liberalization, and HIV/AIDS efforts in Africa. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress passed several acts to support African countries, including the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act, African Conflict Resolution Act, South African Democratic Transition Support Act, Development Fund for Africa, Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act, and Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. These acts aimed to promote food security, conflict resolution, democracy, and sanctions against apartheid in Africa. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment, which prohibited aid for military operations in Angola. Congress also created the African Development Foundation in 1980 to support grassroots development in Africa. In 1977, Congress repealed the Byrd Amendment as it applied to Rhodesia. The Clark Amendment prohibited military operations in Angola, but it was repealed in 1985. The Byrd Amendment partially exempted the US from UN sanctions on Rhodesia, but it was repealed in 1977.
