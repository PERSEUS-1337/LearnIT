    "content": "The Act titled \"Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2016\" establishes a dental insurance plan for veterans, survivors, and dependents of veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2016 establishes a dental insurance plan for veterans, survivors, and dependents. The plan covers veterans enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and survivors or dependents eligible for medical care. The Secretary will contract with a dental insurer to administer the plan, providing benefits for dental care and treatment. The dental insurance plan for veterans, survivors, and dependents includes benefits such as diagnostic, preventative, restorative, surgical, and emergency services. Enrollment is voluntary for a minimum period set by the Secretary, with premiums adjusted annually to cover all costs. Each individual covered will be notified of any premium adjustments. The dental insurance plan allows for voluntary disenrollment within 30 days of enrollment, with additional circumstances prescribed by the Secretary to ensure fiscal integrity. Individuals must pay the full premium and copayments for coverage. The circumstances for voluntary disenrollment from the dental insurance plan include relocation outside plan jurisdiction, serious medical conditions, and other circumstances determined by the Secretary. Procedures for determinations on disenrollments must be timely. This does not affect the Secretary's responsibility to provide dental care under section 1712. The dental insurance plan under section 1712 will not affect entitlement to outpatient dental services. The plan will be administered according to regulations set by the Secretary and will terminate on December 31, 2021. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections in chapter 17. Repeal of Section 510 of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, which pertains to a dental insurance plan for veterans and survivors and dependents of veterans. This includes a clerical amendment to the table of contents."
