    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, renew key user fee programs like PDUFA and MDUFMA. FDA urged Congress to act before August 1, 2007, to avoid layoffs. FDA used reserve funds to prevent layoffs. The FDA used reserve funds to prevent layoffs 60 days in advance, causing a hiring freeze. The funding uncertainty is affecting employee morale, with 30% eligible for retirement. The bills reauthorize key authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals and address other congressional concerns. FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA regulates products like vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs for effectiveness through premarket approval. Products only regulated for safety may have little oversight. FDA can withdraw unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is focused on balancing the need for speedy market access with product safety. The FDA regulates products for safety and effectiveness, withdrawing unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention is on FDA's performance and funding, with efforts to reauthorize user fee authorities like PDUFA and MDUFMA to generate revenue for the agency. In FY2008, PDUFA and MDUFMA would generate 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees for drug and biological product reviews. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and added new regulatory requirements. The MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, introduced new regulatory requirements for medical device applications and added provisions for reprocessed single-use devices. In contrast, the PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees for drug and biological product reviews. The BPCA and PREA were established to encourage pediatric drug research by providing marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on- and off-patent drugs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 contain provisions offering incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and giving FDA the authority to require postmarket studies of approved pediatric devices to ensure their continued efficacy and safety. Developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more problematic than for adults due to various factors. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases affecting children. The provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen the FDA's system for monitoring adverse effects of marketed products and giving the FDA new authorities to require manufacturers to take action. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, while negative studies may not receive as much attention. Manufacturers may be hesitant to disclose unsuccessful results to avoid negative publicity and competition awareness. Congress and others raised safety concerns in 2004. In 2004, Congress raised concerns about the safety of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA advisory committees provide independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but conflicts of interest may arise among expert members. The FDA advisory committees may have conflicts of interest, leading to bias in drug approval decisions. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address conflicts of interest among committee members. The FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical product submissions and called for modernizing scientific tools to evaluate product safety and effectiveness. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose creating a nonprofit corporation, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, to address these issues. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose the creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation to support FDA in evaluating and predicting safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led to discussions on allowing importation from foreign sources, with some lawmakers considering ways to ensure safety while accessing lower-priced medications. An amendment in S. 1082 aims to regulate importation of prescription drugs by requiring certification from the Secretary of HHS for safety and cost-effectiveness. The FDA has had responsibility for regulating food safety since 1906. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about both domestic and imported food products. S. 1082 addresses some food safety issues, but not all, in a comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform bill. The bill includes provisions for a Reagan-Udall Foundation to support FDA in evaluating medical products and addresses the importation of prescription drugs with a requirement for certification from the Secretary of HHS. The remaining sections of this report contain descriptions of key FDA programs addressed in the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, Reagan-Udall Foundation, office of the chief scientist, and food safety. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes the program. PDUFA gives FDA a revenue source from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite product approval processes. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) restricts the use of funds to new product review and sets performance goals for review times. PDUFA II and III allowed FDA to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for PDUFA IV in 2007 focused on postmarket drug safety. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing assessment, collection, and use of application, establishment, and product fees for both prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose new fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs, including application, establishment, and product fees. They aim to enhance postmarket safety activities, such as adverse event data collection and reporting requirements. The proposed fee revenues would be $393 million annually, with adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. The House bill would exempt orphan drugs marketed by smaller companies from certain fees. Both bills would also authorize the assessment and collection of fees under a new section of the FFDCA. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose new fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs to fund advisory review of certain drug advertisements. Manufacturer requests for pre-release review would be voluntary, with FDA responses being advisory. The Senate bill would codify certain core elements of the prescription drug user fee program and require annual reports to Congress. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose new fees for drugs to fund advisory review of certain advertisements. S. 1082 would require a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations for PDUFA V, including goals and plans for meeting them. The House bill would have similar reauthorization and report requirements but would not amend the FFDCA. User fees for medical devices were introduced by the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) established user fees for premarket reviews of devices, allowed inspections by third parties, and imposed new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress through bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. These bills also propose fee adjustments and reauthorization through FY2012. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012. They include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012 and the addition of three new types of fees. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The bills also extend the requirement for a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012 to assess fees. Fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 would be considered in aggregate, with excess fees subtracted from the subsequent year's collection. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012. They include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012 and the addition of three new types of fees. The bills also address the review of postmarket safety information on medical devices and make adjustments to small business qualification for fee reductions. Both bills propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012. They outline a new refund policy for modular applications and require the Secretary to file annual reports. H.R. 2900 includes information on postmarket safety activities in the reports, while S. 1082 requires information on previous cohorts of medical device applications to be made public. Both bills mandate FDA to consult with various groups in developing performance goal recommendations, publish them for public comment, and revise them based on feedback before transmitting to Congress. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose amendments related to medical device regulation, including extending the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications and revising requirements for inspections by accredited third parties. H.R. 2900 also includes a provision for the Comptroller General to conduct a study on nosocomial infections related to medical devices. The bills differ in their effective dates for user fee provisions, with H.R. 2900 taking effect upon enactment and S. 1082 on October 1, 2007. The bills propose amendments to medical device regulation, including third-party review of premarket notifications and changes to registration requirements. FDA would consider reports from third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards. Both bills aim to streamline registration processes and require electronic filing. FDA has approved products for adults without testing in children, leading to off-label use in pediatric patients. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies on their patented products by adding six months to market exclusivity. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved products for children can lead to ineffective treatment or inappropriate dosing due to differences in metabolism and side effects unique to children. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes pediatric studies for off-patent drugs and authorizes NIH funding. It also addresses on-patent drugs by referring manufacturers to the Foundation for the NIH if they decline FDA's requests for pediatric studies. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) covers drugs and biological products, requiring pediatric assessments for approved products. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) covers drugs and biological products, including provisions for deferrals, waivers, and required pediatric assessments. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, with differences in exclusivity periods and FDA authority expansion under PREA. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA). H.R. 2900 would remove the connection between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization, while S. 1082 would maintain it. Both bills also include provisions to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products, such as the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 which modifies the humanitarian device exemption to incentivize the development of medical devices for rare diseases. The legislation aims to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for small markets, exempting some manufacturers from selling devices above costs. Both bills extend the exemption and require funding for pediatric medical device research. Additionally, they mandate the establishment of a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Both bills aim to promote pediatric device development through a demonstration project, grant funding, and coordination with NIH and FDA. They would authorize $6 million annually for FY2008 through FY2012 and expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics to include pediatric medical devices. Postmarket surveillance measures would also be incorporated into the FFDCA. Both bills would expand the Secretary's authority for postmarket studies on pediatric medical devices, requiring safety controls for class II or III devices. H.R. 2900 specifies that studies may be required for devices indicated for pediatric populations, with a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act has required drug manufacturers to demonstrate safety since 1938, with effectiveness added in 1962. The FDA cannot guarantee the complete safety of any drug, but evaluates if it is safe enough for its intended use. Recent concerns have arisen regarding the safety of some widely used drugs, highlighting issues with industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety concerns. The FDA requested the Institute of Medicine to assess its handling of drug safety due to concerns about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety issues. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's authority to identify and correct postmarket drug safety problems through public-private partnerships and electronic databases. The FDA is seeking to strengthen its postmarket safety activities through the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Proposed legislation aims to enhance FDA's authority to require postmarket studies for drugs and biologics, with criteria differing between Senate and House bills. The Secretary could mandate a REMS pre-approval to ensure benefits outweigh risks, or post-approval if new safety information arises. The Senate bill aims to enhance the FDA's authority to require postmarket studies for drugs and biologics based on serious risk signals. It mandates REMS for new indications, generic products, and includes core elements like timeframes and monitoring systems. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies are allowed, and access to drugs with REMS for off-label use for serious conditions is ensured. The Senate bill proposes creating a mechanism to ensure access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious or life-threatening conditions. It includes structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement processes. Both the Senate and House bills establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board and require reviews of approved REMS at specified times. The bills also authorize the Secretary to evaluate whether REMS elements assure safe use of a drug without limiting patient access or burdening the healthcare system. Both the Senate and House bills authorize the Secretary to require postapproval studies or clinical trials to assess drug safety. The Senate bill focuses on assessing serious risks and unexpected risks, while the House bill addresses known risks and signals of serious risk. Additionally, the Senate bill requires communication between the sponsor and the Secretary regarding new safety information for drug labeling. The House and Senate bills propose processes for changing drug labeling, including a multi-level dispute resolution procedure and time limits for sponsors and the Secretary. They also authorize the Secretary to review certain advertisements before dissemination, with criteria varying between the bills. Both bills emphasize the need for clear presentation of side effects and contraindications. Both House and Senate bills propose penalties for violations of REMS requirements, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The House bill includes additional penalties for ongoing violations, while both bills allow the Secretary to consider non-compliant drugs as misbranded. The House and Senate bills propose penalties for violations of REMS requirements, with fines ranging from $150,000 to $500,000 for false or misleading DTC ads. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill allowing for $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 and the House bill authorizing $125 million over the same period. The House bill authorizes $30 million annually for orphan drug development grants and contracts, while the Senate bill allocates $35 million each fiscal year for orphan antibiotics. The Senate bill includes provisions for extended marketing exclusivity for certain antibiotics and requires standardized packaging with counterfeit-resistant technologies for prescription drugs. The House bill focuses on developing standards and technologies to secure the distribution system against counterfeit, diverted, or substandard drugs. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety, such as establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations. It also mandates the inclusion of drug safety information on a dedicated website. The bill would require state-legalized medical marijuana to comply with FDA regulations, establish a priority review voucher for neglected disease products, create a list of authorized generic drugs, and prevent delays in agency decisions. Clinical trial registration requirements were set by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. The current registry at clinicaltrials.gov may be expanded to include more types of trials and information, as proposed in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. These proposals would require registration of most clinical trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 would delay the public release of medical device information until FDA approval. S. 1082 would exempt pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements and allow voluntary registration of non-required trials. Both bills would align certain requirements with the trial completion date. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose linking certain requirements to the completion date of clinical trials. H.R. 2900 specifies that the principal investigator must have control over data and the right to publish results to serve as the responsible party. Both bills expand the information required in the registry, mandate specific searchability criteria, and prohibit false or misleading information. H.R. 2900 includes additional elements such as disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing or publishing trial details. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both propose requirements for clinical trial disclosure. H.R. 2900 includes disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results and specifies updates to be submitted every six months. S. 1082 has more criteria for the searchable registry and mandates public disclosure timelines. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for a results database, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to create one based on NIH Director recommendations. H.R. 2900 mandates the creation of a results database with specific categories and timing for submissions. A requirement for non-promotional summaries was removed, replaced by a study on promotional content. Clinical trial results must be made public within 30 days of certain events, potentially revealing information on pending FDA actions. The timing provision in H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 could lead to the early disclosure of clinical trial information for devices or new uses of drugs. Both bills include provisions for coordination, compliance, and enforcement. H.R. 2900 focuses on registry and results database requirements, while S. 1082 emphasizes registry provisions. H.R. 2900 also addresses enforcement of results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database. One controversial provision in H.R. 2900, not present in S. 1082, would have allowed causes of action for damages. The provision dropped from H.R. 2900 specified no legal effect on state law causes of action for damages. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 have penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements. H.R. 2900 allows penalties of $10,000 per day, while S. 1082 allows $10,000 for first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The FDA's current approach to conflicts of interest in advisory committees allows for exceptions under specific circumstances. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting. These bills aim to expand requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. Advisory committee members are governed by laws such as the Federal Advisory Committee Act and Acts Affecting Personal Financial Interest. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest regulations to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. They define advisory committees as entities providing advice to the FDA and financial interest as activities related to employment, trusteeship, or directorship. The bills also focus on recruiting experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups for advisory committee membership. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest regulations for advisory committees, requiring full financial disclosure and prohibiting voting by members with conflicts of interest unless exempted. They allow for waivers of the voting restriction for essential expertise, with H.R. 2900 permitting only one waiver per meeting. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers are required, along with annual reports on advisory committee membership and conflict-of-interest waivers. The Secretary must review and update FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest regulations for advisory committees, requiring full financial disclosure and prohibiting voting by members with conflicts of interest unless exempted. They establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission regarding product development, innovation, and safety, with a Board of Directors selecting members from various organizations. The Foundation would coordinate with federal programs, award grants, contracts, and other agreements to advance goals, with the Commissioner transferring funds to the Foundation. The bills also require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. The Senate and House bills would require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA Office of the Commissioner. S. 1082 allows importation of prescription drugs and sets procedures for safety and effectiveness. The Senate added a provision that would become effective only if certified by the HHS Secretary to pose no additional risk to public health. The addition of a second-degree amendment in the legislation effectively nullified the original language, as certification by the HHS Secretary was required for it to become effective. The topic of food safety is addressed in S. 1082, specifically in Title VI and several sections of Title V. Title VI of S. 1082 focuses on regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, as well as establishing an early warning system for identifying adulteration and disease outbreaks in pet food. Title VI of S. 1082 focuses on regulations for pet food processing, establishing an early warning system for identifying adulteration and disease outbreaks in pet food, and creating a registry for reportable adulterated food. The Secretary would collect recall information, alert the public, coordinate activities, provide assistance to states, and issue alerts for repeated outbreaks or reportable adulterated food. The responsible party or importer of adulterated food would be held accountable. The responsible party or importer of an adulterated food would be accountable for maintaining records and reporting to FDA once adulteration is determined. The Secretary must establish regulations for reporting suspected adulteration and notify the Department of Homeland Security in case of deliberate adulteration. Annual reports to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions are required. Dietary supplement regulations are not affected by these provisions. Title V of S. 1082 includes provisions for reports on various food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards of substances in fresh meat, color additive certification, risks of genetically engineered seafood, and marketing of crustaceans. It also prohibits importing from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and authorizes enhancements to FDA inspection regime for aquaculture and seafood. Additionally, S. 1082 has provisions for the sale of pet turtles under specific requirements. S. 1082 includes provisions for the sale of pet turtles under specific requirements, an Institute of Medicine report on genetic test safety, an FDA report on indoor tanning device labeling and skin cancer risks, and expressions of the Senate's sense on FDA regulation flexibility and intellectual property concerns. The House bill requires the Secretary to enter into collaborative agreements with educational or tax-exempt organizations to implement the FDA Critical Path Initiative, allocating $5 million for FY2008 and additional funds for FYs 2009 through 2012."
