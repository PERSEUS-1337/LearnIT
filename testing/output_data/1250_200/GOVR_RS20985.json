    "content": "Procurement contracts used by federal agencies for forest stewardship services involve identifying tasks to be performed, such as cutting unmerchantable trees and treating materials. Contracts are currently awarded to the lowest bidder, but Congress could consider other factors like local employment or bidder's past performance. Some suggest selling commercially valuable material separately under a procurement contract, a practice known as log sales. The Forest Service has discussed log sales for national forests for 40 years, but has not extensively used this authority. Traditional procurement contracting for forest stewardship is favored for its simplicity and familiarity, allowing for congressional oversight. However, a major limitation is the lack of innovation and potential for improvement in federal forest stewardship efforts. The Forest Service has identified 36 million federal acres at high risk of ecological damage from wildfires, with treatment costs potentially exceeding $20 billion. If all 231 million federal acres are treated, the total cost could reach around $70 billion. Traditional service contracting for federal forest stewardship has limitations in terms of cost and effectiveness. Suggested modifications to traditional service procurement contracting for forest stewardship could improve federal forest health by focusing on desired conditions rather than tasks or biomass removal. However, challenges exist in developing standardized measures for desired forest conditions and ensuring independence in log sales. Traditional service procurement contracting has limitations for improving federal forest health, with observers believing it is necessary to find alternative approaches. To improve federal forest health, alternative approaches like goods-for-services contracts have been proposed, where timber purchasers perform additional services in exchange for paying less for the harvested timber. These contracts, also known as land management service contracts or stewardship contracts, aim to combine activities like salvage sales with mixed-species planting or prescribed burning after thinning. Pilot tests of goods-for-services contracts were authorized in the FY1992 and FY1993 Interior Appropriations Acts. In 1998, Congress established a broader test of goods-for-services contracting with 28 \"stewardship end result contracting demonstration projects\" authorized in the FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act. Additional projects were authorized in the FY2001 and FY2002 Interior Appropriations Acts. The 2002 Farm Bill also considered goods-for-services stewardship contracting. The House-passed version of H.R. 2646 would have authorized goods-for-services contracting for the Forest Service through FY2007, while the Senate-passed version would have authorized 28 contracts consistent with previous legislation. The FY2003 Interior Appropriations Act (H.R. 5093) debated stewardship contracting for wildfire management funding, but the final bill (P.L. 107-171) did not include provisions on goods-for-services contracting. President Bush proposed goods-for-services stewardship contracting after the 2002 fire season to reduce forest fuels. The FY2003 Interior Appropriations Act (Division F of P.L. 108-7) amended the FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act to authorize \"stewardship end result contracting\" through FY2013 and extended the program to BLM lands. Section 323 of the FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act was amended to authorize \"stewardship end result contracting\" through FY2013, extend the program to BLM lands, remove \"demonstration\" from the provision, modify cutting objectives, and allow non-timber harvesting requirements. The statute allows for removing vegetation and using the value of timber or forest products to offset service costs, but does not directly specify commercial timber sales. It is unclear if stewardship contracts can be used where commercial timber harvesting is prohibited. Goods-for-services contracting may offer greater efficiency. Goods-for-services contracting offers greater efficiency and cost savings in forest stewardship activities by using the same equipment and personnel for both timber harvesting and service tasks. Proponents also see it as off-budget financing for forest stewardship, allowing federal agencies to purchase stewardship services with timber assets instead of appropriations. The use of goods-for-services contracts in forest stewardship activities may lead to higher contracting costs due to combining multiple activities in one contract. Critics suggest that the process is cumbersome and requires more upfront effort, resulting in higher costs compared to separate contracts. Additionally, bypassing the annual appropriations process with goods-for-services contracting may lead to less congressional oversight and control. In bypassing the annual appropriations process, goods-for-services contracting is likely to receive less congressional oversight and control, potentially allowing agencies to use this method for many years with little public participation or congressional control. Some question the appropriateness of goods-for-services contracting, as it creates incentives for managers to increase the sale of goods to provide services. This has been described as \"perverse incentives\" in the context of timber sales under the KV Fund. Exchanging timber for forest stewardship activities may create perverse incentives, especially when activities involve cutting non-commercial woody biomass for wildfire protection. Dominant use of goods-for-services contracts on commercial timber lands could limit stewardship opportunities on other federal forests. The success of goods-for-services contracts is challenging to evaluate, with some questioning the appropriateness of a broad-scale, long-term program. The effectiveness and efficiency of goods-for-services stewardship contracting has not been independently audited despite being considered an important experimental opportunity to test alternative contracting arrangements under real-world conditions."
