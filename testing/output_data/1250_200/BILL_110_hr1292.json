FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the United States went to war against Iraq in 2003 without clearly defined political and military goals, inadequate troop levels and strategy, and without sufficient armor and equipment. The President ignored advice from military leaders, leading to strain on the military. The United States military is straining under the weight of the war in Iraq, with justifications for the use of force shifting from weapons of mass destruction to establishing democracy. Public Law 107-243 authorized the President to defend against the threat posed by Iraq. Public Law 107-243 authorized the President to use force to defend the national security of the United States against the threat posed by Iraq. Currently, US troops in Iraq are facing a Sunni insurgency and a sectarian conflict, which do not directly threaten the US. The President's policies of preemption and unilateralism have led to an open-ended occupation without a clear exit strategy. The escalation of military force in Iraq marks a departure from traditional US policies of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is repealed. Congress should vote on a new authorization for the use of force resolution that reflects the current situation in Iraq, abandons the Bush Doctrine of preemption and unilateralism, and realigns US policy with diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. The US should establish a quick-reaction military force in the region, enhance diplomatic relations for Iraqi national reconciliation, and engage neighboring countries and the League of Arab States for stability in Iraq. The United States should increase efforts to engage neighboring countries and the League of Arab States in promoting stability in Iraq, maintain commitment to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, redirect support to Afghanistan to counter the Taliban, and aggressively pursue terrorist organizations like al Qaeda."
