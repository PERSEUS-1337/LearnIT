    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution. This cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, contains stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor and preserved for transplantation in medical emergencies or research purposes. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants include immediate availability for transplantation, reduced risks to the donor, quicker donor cell unit availability, and lower risk of transplant complications compared to bone marrow transplants. In conventional bone marrow transplantation, finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who often struggle to find fully matched donors. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, allowing for fully matched or partially matched transplants. This reduces complications like graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplants. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can expedite the process of finding a suitable donor. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can expedite finding suitable donors for transplants, especially for genetic conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia prevalent in certain ethnic groups. Patients with this disease have a high risk of severe infections and painful crises, with a median lifespan of 42 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown to cure patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially when done early in the course of the disease. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for ethnic minority patients, with an ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of 150,000 units potentially helping 90% of African American patients find suitable donors for successful treatment. Since its inception in 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. Cord blood transplantation complements conventional bone marrow transplantation by providing appropriately matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity, who have a much lower probability of finding an adequate match through the National Marrow Donor Program. Cord blood is one of the sources of stem cells used in transplantation, however, its collection, preparation, storage, and dissemination require specific systems and expertise. Radiation exposure could cause bone marrow failure, requiring treatment including bone marrow reconstitution. In these cases, the rapid availability of cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be important. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network under section 376A. This network aims to advance research on cord blood stem cells for chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under the Public Health Service Act, defines key terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, human cord blood stem cells, and National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established to contain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks in the network is to acquire, tissue-type, test, cryopreserve, and store donated units of human cord blood for stem cell transplantation. A cord blood stem cell bank must have necessary licenses, certifications, and registrations, implement donor screening and collection practices, and maintain strict confidentiality to be eligible as a donor bank. A cord blood stem cell bank must have strict confidentiality measures to protect patient and donor privacy, encourage donation from diverse groups, and establish communication systems with other banks and medical facilities. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, aims to track clinical outcomes, educate the public about cord blood stem cell donation, and administer a board of directors for coordination and registry establishment. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is appointed by the Secretary and includes representatives from various sectors such as cord blood stem cell transplant centers, participating birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members of patients, social sciences experts, and the general public. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various sectors such as cord blood stem cell transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members of patients, social sciences experts, and the general public. Members may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, with approximately 1/3 of the Board members' terms expiring each year to ensure continuity. The Board members may continue to serve after their term expires until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network, which will operate a system for acquiring and distributing donated cord blood units matched to patients, provide a website for searching donor matches, and maintain a database. The Network will maintain a database to document cord blood units' collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The database will operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality. The Administrator will report to the Secretary periodically on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of Network activities, with information made available to the public. The Secretary will ensure that the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network meets standards and is geographically distributed. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006-2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
