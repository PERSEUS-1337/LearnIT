    "content": "We propose a novel architecture called Gaussian prototypical networks for k-shot classification on the Omniglot dataset. This model extends prototypical networks by incorporating a confidence region estimate as a Gaussian covariance matrix, improving classification accuracy. Experimental results show superior performance in 1-shot and 5-shot classification tasks compared to vanilla prototypical networks. Additionally, artificially down-sampling images in the training set further enhances performance, suggesting potential benefits for noisy datasets in real-world applications. Our experiments suggest that Gaussian prototypical networks may excel in noisy datasets common in real-world applications. Few-shot learning aims to mimic human ability to recognize new object categories with minimal examples. Deep learning models, while powerful, struggle with rapid adaptation to new data, unlike few-shot learning which requires quick adjustment to unseen classes with limited examples. Few-shot learning, specifically k-shot classification, involves quickly adapting to new data with limited labeled examples. Non-parametric models like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) avoid overfitting but rely heavily on distance metrics. Recent advancements in k-shot classification involve BID0 Architectures that combine parametric and non-parametric models. A novel architecture, the Gaussian prototypical network, is developed based on prototypical networks used in BID16, trained and tested on the Omniglot dataset BID9. This model maps images into embedding vectors and estimates image quality, predicting a confidence region around the embedding vector for classification. The Gaussian prototypical network maps images into embedding vectors and estimates image quality, predicting a confidence region characterized by a Gaussian covariance matrix. It learns a direction and class dependent distance metric in the embedding space, outperforming vanilla prototypical networks by expressing confidence in individual data points. The model's performance is on par with state-of-the-art in 1-shot and 5-shot classification on the Omniglot dataset, showing potential for lower quality, inhomogeneous datasets. In this paper, the model's advantage is highlighted in lower quality, inhomogeneous datasets. The episodic training scheme and experiments on the Omniglot dataset are discussed. Non-parametric models like k-nearest neighbors are suitable for few-shot classifiers but sensitive to distance metric choice. Learning a metric embedding for kNN classification has shown promising results. Matching networks have also been proposed for learning distance metrics between pairs of data points. Our approach in few-shot learning involves using matching networks to learn a distance metric between image pairs, improving classification performance. Meta-learning, specifically using LSTM to predict updates for few-shot classifiers, has shown high accuracies on datasets like Omniglot. A task-agnostic meta-learner based on temporal convolutions has been proposed, outperforming other approaches. Combinations of parametric and non-parametric methods have been successful in few-shot learning, with our focus on image classification. Non-parametric methods have been successful in few-shot learning for image classification. Our model, based on BID16, uses clustering for classification and predicts confidence with a learned covariance matrix. It projects images into a richer embedding space and uses clustering for classification based on distance metrics. The Gaussian prototypical network diagram illustrates how support images define prototypes and covariance matrices for classification of query images. In this paper, a Gaussian prototypical network is introduced, building on the prototypical networks described in BID16. The model predicts embedding vectors and confidence regions for individual data points using a Gaussian covariance matrix. The network uses support images to define class prototypes and classifies query images based on the proximity of their embeddings to the prototypes. The key difference between vanilla and Gaussian prototypical networks lies in how encoder outputs are interpreted and used in constructing the metric on the embedding space. The Gaussian prototypical network builds on the vanilla prototypical network by using a Gaussian covariance matrix to predict embedding vectors and confidence regions for data points. The key difference lies in how encoder outputs are interpreted and used in constructing the metric on the embedding space. The encoder in the Gaussian network outputs a concatenation of an embedding vector x and a real vector s raw relevant to the covariance matrix. Three variants of the Gaussian prototypical network are explored, including a Radius covariance estimate where only a single real number s raw is generated per image. The network uses three variants for covariance estimation: Radius, Diagonal, and Full. The small and big encoder architectures were used to validate experiments and assess model capacity. The full covariance method was deemed too complex and not further explored. The study explored different methods for translating raw covariance matrix output into an actual covariance matrix. Two approaches were used: one with softplus activation and another with sigmoid activation. Both methods ensured the covariance matrix was greater than 1, with the sigmoid method having an upper limit of 2. These approaches proved beneficial for training the models. The study investigated methods for translating raw covariance matrix output into an actual covariance matrix. The encoder's constraints were explored, with S bounded between 1 and 5. A key component was the episodic training regime, where class prototypes were defined in the embedding space for classification. The Gaussian prototypical network uses query examples and class prototypes to classify and calculate loss. It estimates the covariance of each embedding point and learns a class and direction-dependent distance metric in the embedding space. The distance from a class prototype to a query point is calculated using linear Euclidean distances. The specific form of the loss function is presented in Algorithm 1. The prototypical network creates class prototypes from support points using a variance-based method. The algorithm calculates the diagonal of the inverse class covariance matrix to combine Gaussians into an overall class Gaussian. The model's accuracy is estimated on the test set by classifying for different numbers of support points. The study evaluates model performance on the Omniglot dataset using a k-shot classification accuracy approach. Test results for the 5 highest training accuracies are considered to prevent bias, with mean and standard deviation calculated. Models are tested in 5-way and 20-way classifications, with data preprocessed and split as recommended. No class overlap exists between training and test sets. The study evaluated model performance on the Omniglot dataset using k-shot classification accuracy. The training set had 964 unique character classes, and the test set had 659. Data augmentation was done by rotating characters to increase the number of classes. This resulted in 77,120 images in the training set and 52,720 in the test set. Rotation introduced degeneracies for symmetric characters. The study conducted numerous few-shot learning experiments on the Omniglot dataset, exploring Gaussian prototypical networks with different parameters and comparing them to vanilla prototypical networks. The best method found was predicting a single number per embedding point. Other factors explored included encoder size, distance metrics, and covariance matrix options.

They used an Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule and trained models on a single GPU in Google Cloud. The models were tested on 20-way and 5-way classification tasks, with promising results compared to existing literature.

The mini-batch comprised N s = 1 support points per class, with N q = 19 query points. Using encoder outputs as covariance estimates was found to be advantageous. The best performing model was trained on the undamaged dataset for 220 epochs, followed by down-sampling of images for further training. The choices for down-sampling were arbitrary and not optimized over. The study experimented with Gaussian prototypical networks on the Omniglot dataset, varying parameters such as distance metrics and covariance matrix options. The purposeful damage to the dataset encouraged usage of the covariance estimate and increased (k > 1)-shot results. The models perform consistently with state-of-the-art in 1-shot and 5-shot classification on the Omniglot dataset. In particular, in 5-shot 5-way classification, the performance is close to perfect. The effect of down-sampling on test accuracy showed that purposefully damaged data outperformed unmodified data by utilizing covariance estimates better.
