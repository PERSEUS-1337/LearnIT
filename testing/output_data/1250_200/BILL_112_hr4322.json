    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges that hydraulic fracturing has been a widely used practice in the US for over 60 years, with regulations in place to protect water resources. Studies have shown no evidence of drinking water contamination from fracture fluid. The studies and reports mentioned found no evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing in coalbed methane reservoirs or deep and shallow formations. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission stated that states have comprehensive laws to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water, with no verified cases of contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified that she was not aware of any proven cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency testified that there have been no proven cases of water contamination from the fracking process. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes. Congress has chosen not to include the hydraulic fracturing process in underground injection regulations. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from fracking fluid in aquifers. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND: Federal land includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY: States have sole authority over regulations for hydraulic fracturing on their land. Federal land must follow the laws of the state it is located in."
