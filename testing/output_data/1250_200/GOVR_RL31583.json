    "content": "The federal K-12 education assistance legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, has focused on providing flexibility for grantees. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, including waivers for federal program requirements based on certain eligibility criteria and accountability requirements. The federal K-12 education assistance legislation focuses on providing flexibility for grantees by allowing consolidation of programs and transfer of funds. This flexibility applies to programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), excluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The 110th Congress is considering the authorization of ESEA programs through FY2008. The report focuses on federal K-12 education programs authorized through the ESEA, excluding the IDEA. It discusses the flexibility authorities for waiving requirements and issues specific to these authorities. The report also analyzes cross-cutting issues related to special flexibility authorities overall. The 110th Congress is considering amending and extending the ESEA programs through FY2008. Federal K-12 education programs have accountability requirements to ensure funds are used appropriately. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, and development initiatives. Flexibility is provided in areas like instructional methods and grade levels served. Federal K-12 education programs, including those for Limited English Proficient (LEP) pupils, focus on specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas. These programs are categorized as either targeting specific aspects or being more broad in scope, with some considered \"categorical\" programs. Additionally, federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid. Federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid. \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees as a matter of law, derived ultimately from the authorizing statute for a program. Program regulations supplement statutory language primarily on complex issues where the U.S. Department of Education places high priority on specific actions. Regulations may address issues explicitly provided in authorizing statutes or any aid program. The U.S. Department of Education provides federal requirements and guidance to state and local recipients of federal aid. Regulations may address issues explicitly provided in authorizing statutes or any aid program, while \"non-regulatory policy guidance\" is also published for many programs. Grantees are not legally required to follow this guidance, but may perceive it as equivalent to regulations to avoid challenges in using federal aid. The U.S. Department of Education provides federal requirements and guidance to state and local recipients of federal aid. Grantees may treat non-regulatory guidance as equivalent to regulations, especially in competitive grant programs where certain priorities are set for preferential consideration. These priorities, published in the Federal Register, increase the likelihood of receiving support but are not legally required to be followed. Since the adoption of the IASA in 1994, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs. Some programs have no regulations, relying on statutory guidance. Regulations for programs like ESEA Title I-A are briefer and address fewer issues post-1990s. For example, regulations focus on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. After NCLB in 2001, a similar minimalist approach was embraced by the Department of Education. Following the NCLB of 2001, the Department of Education adopted a minimalist approach to regulations for federal education programs, including ESEA Title I-A. The Secretary intends to regulate only when necessary, focusing on providing nonregulatory guidance to inform schools and other parties about flexibility under the statute. This guidance aims to establish accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds in K-12 education assistance programs. Federal elementary and secondary education programs aim to establish accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds by focusing on target, outcome, and fiscal accountability. Target accountability ensures funds are directed towards eligible localities and pupils for equal educational opportunities. Outcome accountability focuses on improving student achievement and K-12 instruction quality. Fiscal accountability ensures financial integrity and prevents federal funds from replacing state or local funds. Federal elementary and secondary education programs have specific requirements to ensure accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds, including targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, enhancing parental participation, and evaluating the effectiveness of instructional services. Violations of these regulations could result in repayment of funds or being prohibited from receiving further grants. Sanctions for states or LEAs failing to meet requirements are rare. General requirements for federal education assistance recipients are outlined in EDGAR and OMB circulars. Regulations on civil rights, student privacy, and child nutrition programs also apply. Additional federal regulations on workplace safety and environmental protection may be relevant to LEAs and schools. State and local educational agencies have wide latitude in using federal education assistance, with regulations on workplace safety, environmental protection, and other areas applicable to LEAs and schools as employers. Complaints about specific program requirements often focus on restrictions like commingling funds and limitations on instructional methods. The curr_chunk discusses prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid on specific pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability requirements under NCLB. These measures aim to ensure fiscal accountability, focus funds on those in need, and improve educational outcomes. The new outcome accountability requirements under NCLB aim to increase the effectiveness of federally supported education services and shift the focus towards improved outcomes. However, these requirements may seem inflexible from a state or local perspective, especially for low enrollment LEAs. The categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial treatment of needs instead of a coherent focus on the whole child and their instructional program. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on resources than on improving student outcomes. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and demographics, leading to misunderstandings of requirements and challenges in focusing aid on students most in need. The 1998 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted concerns from state and local education officials about the challenges in obtaining current and concise information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance. LEA staff often feel constrained by the lack of adequate technical assistance, leading to a cautious approach that limits their flexibility in utilizing federal funds effectively. Staff in surveyed LEAs often lack flexibility due to unawareness or underutilization of available options. Concerns about costs and meeting administrative responsibilities under federal education programs were expressed. Meeting required timelines and logistical challenges posed difficulties. Authorities allowing waivers of federal K-12 program requirements were adopted, with limitations on types of requirements, programs affected, and eligibility. Some waivers require accountability for pupil outcomes. Some federal authorities offer flexibility in waiving K-12 program requirements, with accountability for pupil outcomes in some cases. Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs provide varying levels of flexibility in fund usage. These authorities were established before the NCLB of 2001. Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education can delegate authority to waive certain requirements under ESEA programs to State Education Agencies in participating states. The Ed-Flex authority was initially granted to six states in 1994 and expanded to 12 states in 1996. The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 removed the cap on participating states. Ed-Flex authority was extended until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A in 2006. Currently, no state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. Ed-Flex authority was granted to states until 2006, with the recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) extending it for 10 states until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. States must waive certain requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards, and submit annual reports to ED. No new states can receive Ed-Flex authority under P.L. 109-211. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive certain requirements for LEAs and schools under ESEA Title I-A. States monitor performance and submit annual reports to ED for federal programs including Education for the Disadvantaged, Teacher Training Fund, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and others. This authority also allows states to waive some administrative requirements of the General Education Provisions Act. The Ed-Flex statutes authorize states to waive specific administrative requirements of the General Education Provisions Act and Education Department General Administrative Regulations for certain programs. However, certain requirements related to fiscal accountability, equitable participation, parental involvement, fund allocation, school selection, and civil rights cannot be waived unless approved by the Secretary of Education. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA for waivers, except for statewide \"blanket\" waivers. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA for waivers, providing required information. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements and must ensure statutory purposes are met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including effects on student performance. ED is to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of waivers. The Education Department (ED) is required to make state reports on waivers available to Congress and the public annually. A report summarizing the state reports, including the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance, must be submitted to Congress. However, previous reports lacked information on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and programmatic impacts. Additionally, waivers can be granted to State Education Agencies (SEAs) or Local Education Agencies (LEAs) on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, with a focus on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. The Secretary of Education can waive most requirements under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, requested by SEAs, LEAs, tribes, or schools. Waiver requests must include specific educational goals and measurement methods. Certain requirements cannot be waived, such as prohibitions on using funds for religious instruction or sex education. ESEA Title IX-D allows the Secretary of Education to waive certain requirements for educational purposes, with specific goals and measurement methods required in waiver requests. Prohibitions on using funds for religious instruction or sex education cannot be waived. Waivers granted may not exceed four years and must contribute to improved student achievement. The Secretary can terminate waivers if performance outcomes are inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Department of Education is required to publish notices of waiver decisions in the Federal Register. The Department of Education failed to publish notices of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D for several years. A total of 197 waivers were granted between 2002 and 2006, with most being waivers of administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants. Other waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth models for progress, and providing supplemental educational services. The Department of Education granted 197 waivers between 2002 and 2006 under ESEA Title IX-D, including waivers for administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth models for progress, and providing supplemental educational services. Additionally, waivers were granted for schools participating in the Public Charter Schools program under ESEA Title V, Part B, with unique waiver authority. Under the PCS waiver authority, the Secretary of Education can waive certain requirements, except for those related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. Schools with 40% or more low-income students in the ESEA Title I-A program can implement schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage across federal education programs. Schoolwide programs for disadvantaged pupils under Title I-A and other federal programs are exempt from various regulations, with exceptions for health, safety, civil rights, parental participation, and fiscal accountability. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds. IDEA requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs. This authority primarily impacts Title I-A programs, as other programs typically focus on LEAs rather than individual schools. The flexibility of using Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis is significant compared to targeted assistance programs. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have grown rapidly in recent years, serving a large majority of Title I-A pupils. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs has been reduced. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs under Title I-A has been reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. This change aims to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools, rather than just the lowest-achieving individuals. The rationale behind this decision may be questioned for schools that barely meet the new threshold. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs under Title I-A from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families. This change aims to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. Small, rural schools classified as rural may combine or transfer funds received under various ESEA programs to support activities authorized under those programs. This flexibility aims to help the smallest LEAs make more effective use of limited grant funds. This \"REAP Flex\" authority provides similar special flexibility to eligible small, rural LEAs as another Transferability authority available to almost. The \"REAP Flex\" authority provides special flexibility to eligible small, rural LEAs, allowing them to transfer 100% of funds under certain programs, including ESEA Titles III and IV-B. Participating LEAs can also receive supplementary grants for various purposes. A study by ED found that approximately 51% of eligible LEAs participated in this flexibility authority in 2005-2006, with funds often transferred from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A. In 2005-2006, LEAs participating in REAP Flex transferred funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Rural LEAs found this flexibility useful due to small formula allocations. There was confusion between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, offers special flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A is a block grant program in K-12 education that provides flexibility to states and LEAs in using funds for a wide range of educational activities. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs based on state-developed formulas considering public and private school enrollment. LEAs receive funds based on state-developed formulas that consider public and private school enrollment, with adjustments for high-cost pupils. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received under the program for FY2002 to LEAs. Additionally, states must suballocate varying percentages of Title V-A grants to LEAs based on funding levels, with a maximum of 15% allowed for administrative costs. The Title V-A funds must be suballocated to LEAs at a level of 50%, with states retaining no more than 15% for administrative costs. The remaining funds are to be used for specified programs and services, including pupil assessments, charter schools, school repair, and statewide education reform initiatives. LEAs can use the funds for various innovative assistance programs, such as charter schools, same-gender schools, and school nurse support. Title V-A funds can be used for a variety of programs and services, including pupil assessments, charter schools, school repair, and statewide education reform initiatives. The program was first enacted in 1981 as part of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating multiple federal K-12 education programs into a block grant. LEAs have flexibility in how they use the funds, with a prohibition against state influence over their decisions. The Title V-A program, established in 1981, consolidated federal K-12 education programs into a block grant. A study found that recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and academic services. Large LEAs used funds for teacher development and school improvement. Funds were not often targeted at high-need pupils or schools, with decisions influenced by long-term LEA plans. The Title V-A program, established in 1981, has seen a decline in appropriations over the years, with funding dropping from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. The program's future is uncertain as P.L. 110-161, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008, provided zero funds for Title V-A. Limited support and lack of advocacy for increased funding have contributed to this trend. Funds have been supplemented by other sources like REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, indicating a shift in funding sources for the program. The Title V-A program has faced declining appropriations over the years, with limited information on its effects potentially reducing incentives to maintain funding levels. Funding decisions have favored programs demonstrating targeting of funds or improved educational outcomes. Amendments under the NCLB require states to report on how assistance is improving student achievement. Authorities under the NCLB allow for increased funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions provide increased flexibility. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, including the ability to consolidate SEA or LEA applications and funds. These authorities, found in Parts B and C of ESEA Title IX, aim to provide administrative convenience. NCLB also expanded existing flexibility measures, such as lowering eligibility thresholds for schoolwide programs under ESEA Title I-A. The NCLB amendments introduced flexibility in ESEA programs, allowing LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among various programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can only transfer 30% of their grants to address the issue. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs. States have the authority to transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, excluding administrative funds. The total appropriations for the programs subject to this authority in FY2008 amount to approximately $3.5 billion. The process is simple and does not require specific approval, but transferred funds must still adhere to program requirements. The Innovative Programs block grant can be shifted through Transferability, with program requirements still applying to the transferred funds. Participation in Transferability is low, with confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. LEAs mostly move funds out of ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A. LEAs participating in Transferability often moved funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A to compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources more effectively. Reasons for not participating included lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding levels. Up to seven states may consolidate all their funds under the new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act. Under the State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act, up to seven states can consolidate various education funds for a five-year period, allowing flexibility in fund usage across different ESEA programs. Failure to meet state AYP requirements for two consecutive years may result in losing this authority. The State-Flex authority allows states to consolidate education funds for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. Selected states must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with a focus on high-poverty areas. Florida is the only state granted this authority so far. The State-Flex program allows states to consolidate education funds for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. Florida is the only state granted this authority so far, but they withdrew before implementation. Local-Flex authority allows up to 80 LEAs to consolidate funds for various purposes authorized under ESEA programs. LEAs must meet goals established in their agreements to maintain the authority. Under the Local-Flex program, LEAs must meet goals to maintain authority, with limited waivers for certain requirements. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate, had its eligibility suspended for failing to meet AYP requirements. Seattle has applied for a new agreement. Seattle has recently applied for a new Local-Flex agreement, but there has been little interest in State-Flex and Local-Flex programs due to barriers like additional responsibilities with few benefits and limited information dissemination. A new round of competition for these authorities began in March 2004 with no deadline set. A new round of competition has been announced for State-Flex and Local-Flex programs, with no set deadline. Participants in these programs will receive preference in future grant competitions. State-Flex and Local-Flex offer broad flexibility in fund usage but have limited program requirements. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer flexibility in fund usage with limited program requirements. Participation is limited to a small number of states and LEAs, with low interest despite multiple invitations to compete. State-Flex authority allows states to use administration funds for other purposes but still requires meeting program responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration varies from 1% to 26.5% across different programs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer flexibility in fund usage, with states having varying shares of funds for administration ranging from 1% to 26.5%. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have limited flexibility as their use of funds must align with state use and state authority over Title V-A funds. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex with earlier flexibility authorities in NCLB legislation shows differences in program requirements and fund usage. The final provisions of H.R. 1, enacted as the NCLB, include authority for local flexibility demonstrations in up to 100 LEAs. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. The Senate's proposal would have provided greater flexibility with increased outcome accountability compared to the State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The flexibility/performance agreement provisions were more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals considered during the 106th Congress. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority proposed during the 106th Congress allowed for consolidation of funds from various ESEA programs, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged. Funds could be reallocated among and within LEAs for a wide range of authorized activities. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority allowed for reallocation of funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children. States and LEAs were required to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount. This report also addresses common themes of flexibility in the NCLB. The special flexibility authorities in the NCLB allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their priorities, with limitations on participation and program requirements. Waivers are granted in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. The NCLB provides special flexibility authorities for states and LEAs to use federal aid funds based on their priorities, with accountability tied to pupil achievement outcomes. These authorities have been adopted in a policy context of increased accountability requirements and flexibility for ESEA programs. Among these authorities, REAP Flex is the most widely used by small, rural LEAs. Reporting requirements on the use of flexibility and its impact on pupil achievement are common, but specific impacts are not well-documented. The current flexibility authorities under NCLB provide states and LEAs with limited flexibility in using federal funds, particularly for Title I-A schoolwide programs. The Secretarial waiver authorities require individual requests, and LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. The specific impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement is not well-documented. The flexibility authorities under NCLB provide limited flexibility in using federal funds. LEAs must apply for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. Certain restrictions apply, such as a 50% limit on fund transfers and specific eligibility criteria for rural LEA and State-Flex authorities. Participation rates in these authorities are low due to the limited increase in flexibility provided. Certain requirements, like fiscal accountability and participation by private school pupils, cannot be waived under any of these authorities. The Ed-Flex authority under NCLB provides limited flexibility in using federal funds, with restrictions on fund transfers and specific eligibility criteria. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and participation by private school pupils, cannot be waived. However, the flexibility authorities do not include the largest ESEA program, Title I-A, and do not allow states to reallocate funds among LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that the flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, which are associated with requirements under IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental regulations. Some states find Ed-Flex of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that may be waived. The Ed-Flex authority provides limited flexibility in using federal funds, with restrictions on fund transfers and specific eligibility criteria. Some states find it of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that may be waived, while others see it as creating a climate for innovation and flexibility. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements. The NCLB has provided increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in determining how funds may be used, making the additional flexibility provided by special authorities seem relatively marginal in many respects. The special authorities for increased flexibility in federal education programs, such as waivers, have been used for relatively few purposes with limited information available on their effectiveness. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress, which has been a widely supported modification. The ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions include flexibility authorities like REAP Flex and Transferability, which are often used to reallocate funds between different programs. Many LEAs use these authorities to address reductions in formula grants, target resources to schools not meeting AYP standards, or utilize funds with high flexibility. Pre-NCLB flexibility authorities were mainly used to waive requirements like the low-income pupil percentage threshold for Title I-A schoolwide programs. Authorities in the mid- to late-1990s were used to waive requirements for ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility, targeting of funds on schools with high numbers of low-income pupils, deadlines for standards and assessments adoption, and limitations on fund use for teacher programs. There are concerns about granting schoolwide program authority to schools with low poverty rates. The use of waivers to expand Title I-A schoolwide programs to schools with low poverty rates may limit program impact. There is no clear evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs for disadvantaged students. Waivers could disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing focus on high-poverty schools. Waivers to delay ESEA Title I-A requirements may undermine accountability. The NCLB undercut significant pre-NCLB outcome accountability requirements, including waivers for teacher hiring, consortia formation, teacher training funds, and professional development limits. Post-NCLB, Ed-Flex and other pre-NCLB flexibility authorities are less relevant due to changes in schoolwide program eligibility thresholds. The NCLB lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program. Limited information is available on the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement. Anecdotal information on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers was included in a 1999 ED report. The 1999 ED report included anecdotal information on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs, focusing on whether affected LEAs or schools met state AYP standards. Supporters of special flexibility authorities argue that Ed-Flex has supported standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination, streamlining administration, and optimizing resource use. Ed-Flex supports resource use to improve student achievement by shifting focus to outcomes. Limited data on improved pupil achievement outcomes questions the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities. Lack of information dissemination by ED hinders analysis of benefits and impact. The lack of relevant information dissemination by ED makes it difficult to evaluate the significance and impact of waivers and special flexibility authorities on pupil achievement. The effectiveness of outcome accountability requirements associated with these authorities is questioned, as it is unclear if they adequately substitute for other forms of accountability. The flexibility authorities granted to states and LEAs involve setting goals, meeting AYP requirements, and implementing programs like Ed-Flex. A GAO study found that states varied in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals for waivers. ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation was limited, mainly involving the collection of annual reports. The GAO study found that ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation by states was limited, with varying degrees of detail in the information provided. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states, but rather emphasize meeting AYP requirements. This places increased consequences on failing to meet generally applicable outcome accountability requirements. The special flexibility authority under the NCLB may not provide substantial enhancements to outcome accountability requirements, but it does offer additional incentives for schools, LEAs, and states to meet AYP requirements. This additional accountability is in line with the nature of the special flexibility authorities described in the report, which also highlight the limited flexibility and increased outcome accountability. The NCLB has expanded outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools, regardless of special flexibility authority. Some proponents argue for increased state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds without the need for additional outcome or accountability requirements. Critics, however, believe that granting special flexibility without adequate accountability provisions could undermine national priorities. Critics are concerned that special flexibility authorities lack sufficient accountability provisions and have been used for unproven program effectiveness."
