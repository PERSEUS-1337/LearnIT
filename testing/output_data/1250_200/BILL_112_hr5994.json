The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" establishes a demonstration program for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries to purchase qualifying health benefits coverage and access a Medi-Choice card for out-of-pocket health care expenses. Qualifying health benefits coverage must be comprehensive for dual eligible beneficiaries. The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" ensures that qualifying health benefits coverage for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries in California is as comprehensive as current benefits under Medicare and Medicaid plans. There are no preexisting condition exclusions. The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" in California guarantees issue coverage without preexisting condition exclusions and uniform premiums that do not vary based on age, health status, or other characteristics. SEC. 3. MEDI-CHOICE CARD. The Secretary will contract with a credit card provider to issue Medi-Choice cards for purchasing health benefits coverage and covering out-of-pocket costs for eligible beneficiaries. Unused amounts on the card can be used for qualified medical expenses until expended. The Medi-Choice card can be used for qualified medical expenses by enrolled eligible beneficiaries until the amount is expended. SEC. 4. ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES. In this Act, an eligible beneficiary is a legal permanent resident of the United States eligible for medical assistance under specific programs, excluding those enrolled in disability programs, entitled to certain benefits, imprisoned, or non-lawful permanent residents. In this Act, a Medicare eligible beneficiary is defined as an eligible beneficiary under subsection (a)(2)(B), while a Medicaid eligible beneficiary is described under subsection (a)(2)(A). A dual eligible beneficiary is someone who qualifies for both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. SEC. 5. FUNDING OF MEDI-CHOICE CARDS. The Secretary will provide funds through the Medi-Choice card for dual eligible beneficiaries and other Medicaid eligible beneficiaries based on specified annual amounts. For Medicaid eligible beneficiaries who are not dual eligible, the annual deposit amount is based on the United States average value of medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, with adjustments for inflation. For Medicare eligible beneficiaries who are not dual eligible, the annual deposit amount is based on the United States average value of benefits under parts A, B, and D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, with adjustments for inflation. The payment amounts under subsection (a) for an individual are adjusted based on relative risk factors, without changing the total payments. Higher-income individuals may face reductions based on their modified adjusted gross income exceeding a specified threshold. The Social Security Act allows for reductions in annual payment amounts if income exceeds a specified threshold. The annual inflation adjustment is based on consumer price index increases. Monthly deposits are made to Medi-Choice cards. Monthly deposits to Medi-Choice cards are credited on a monthly basis and prorated for partial months of program enrollment. The demonstration program in California will be conducted in specific counties for a 10-year period, starting on June 1, 2013. No more than 100,000 eligible beneficiaries can enroll at any time. Payment of costs is outlined in the following section. The Secretary is responsible for operating the demonstration program in California for a 10-year period. Costs, including amounts deposited onto Medi-Choice cards, will be paid from respective trust funds for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries. No duplicate payments will be made under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act for participants in the program. The Secretary will provide assistance in enrollment for eligible beneficiaries in the demonstration program, including a toll-free phone number and information on plan options. Amounts paid into a Medi-Choice card will not be considered as income for tax or eligibility purposes. Participants are not responsible for premium payments under Medicare or Medicaid but must use benefits for health coverage. Individuals in the program are not entitled to Medicaid payments. The individual participating in the demonstration program is not entitled to Medicaid payments for benefits covered under the program. Medical assistance for noncovered items like dental, vision, or long-term care services will continue under title XIX of the Social Security Act."
