    "content": "The United States has a history of relying on domestic energy sources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy in the 20th century. Federal efforts have focused on increasing energy independence, reducing consumption, and developing renewable energy sources through various programs that have evolved over the past 40 years to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Many energy programs have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. These programs apply broadly to various sectors and have been designed to address current needs and future challenges. Since 2005, Congress has enacted several major energy laws that established, expanded, or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy operates the most incentive programs, with additional programs run by the Departments of Treasury and Agriculture. The Department of the Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration operate federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy RDD&D. Program details are sourced from various federal agency websites, statutes, and budget documents. Funding information is compiled from sources like DSIRE and executive agency budget justifications. The budgetary figures for agriculture-related grant programs were compiled from various sources including executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports. Additional information on alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technology incentives can be found in CRS Report R42566. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in detail in the same report. Appendices provide a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, an index of programs by applicant eligibility and technology type, and a list of expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. Expired Federal Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Incentive Programs include various programs such as Assisted Housing Stability and Energy and Green Retrofit Investments Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and Renewable Energy Grants (1603 Program)."
