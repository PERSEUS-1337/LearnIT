The Act \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\" includes findings by Congress regarding the negative impact of successive military regimes in Nigeria, the progress made by the current regime under Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar, and the cooperation in halting international drug trafficking. Since 1993, the United States and other international members have imposed sanctions against Nigeria for human rights violations and political repression, some of which have been lifted due to recent political liberalization. Despite progress in protecting freedoms, decrees still exist that suspend constitutional rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and revoke civilian court jurisdiction over executive actions. Nigeria is obligated to conduct fair elections under international agreements. Nigeria, as a leading military force in ECOWAS, has played a significant role in peacekeeping efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Despite progress, recent events in the Niger Delta highlight the need for ongoing monitoring to prevent a return to repressive tactics.

The United States Agency for International Development will provide grants to nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria to promote democracy, human rights, and accountable government. Additionally, the United States Information Agency will support activities in Nigeria to increase awareness.
