    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"General Equivalency Diploma Reform and Improvement Act of 2001\". Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government and many State and local agencies have promoted the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) over a traditional high school degree. However, with the current economy requiring higher skilled workers, the GED is no longer a sufficient alternative. Economists Stephen Cameron and James Heckman found that individuals with exam-certified high school equivalents are similar to high school dropouts in the labor market, with comparable poor wages, earnings, and job experiences. Individuals with General Equivalency Diplomas are closer to high school dropouts in terms of labor market status, have inferior status even after controlling for ability, lower employment rates, less work experience, and face discounting by employers and the military. Education programs focusing solely on obtaining a GED are misguided. Teenage pregnancy and early job tenure rates are also mentioned. Approximately 3,941,553 adolescent girls between the ages of 10 and 17 gave birth in 1999 in the United States. Efforts should be made to prevent unintended pregnancies, but pregnant teenagers and young mothers should also be provided with educational opportunities to become productive citizens and good parents. No Americans, including pregnant teenagers, should receive a second-rate education. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REVIEW OF POLICIES. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities for all, including pregnant teenagers and young mothers. This includes cooperating with federal agencies, working with states and local educational agencies, encouraging dropouts to return for additional training, and supporting individuals currently employed. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma, review policies to improve educational opportunities, and make recommendations for reform within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. Authorization of appropriations for $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 is provided to carry out the Act."
