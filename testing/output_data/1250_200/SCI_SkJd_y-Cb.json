It can incorporate additional meta-data like syntactic features and part-of-speech information. Word2net outperforms other methods in predicting words and produces interpretable semantic representations. Word embeddings extract semantic features from text data using word2net, a method that utilizes neural networks to predict word occurrences in context. It incorporates additional meta-data like syntactic features and part-of-speech information, outperforming other methods in predicting words and producing interpretable semantic representations. Word embeddings are a statistical tool for analyzing language, learning vector representations of vocabulary based on the distributional hypothesis. They rely on a log-bilinear model to associate each term with embedding and context vectors, maximizing an objective function through neural networks. Various methods like negative sampling and Bernoulli embeddings help handle large vocabularies. Word embeddings, such as negative sampling and Bernoulli embeddings, use linear classifiers for large vocabularies. Word2net introduces a non-linear approach by replacing word vectors with term-specific neural networks. These networks capture non-linear interactions between words, leading to a more accurate language model. Additionally, word networks allow for parameter sharing based on word-level meta-data, like part-of-speech tags. Word2net models share parameters based on part-of-speech tags, allowing for non-linear interactions between words. The objective includes the probability of a binary variable based on context. The neural network outputs the probability of a word, with parameter sharing based on word tags. In word embedding models, parameter sharing based on part-of-speech tags improves performance compared to other methods like word2vec. Various extensions and variants of word embeddings exist, with most relying on a log-bilinear model to learn semantic features of words from document co-occurrence patterns. Our model differs from deep neural network architectures by having a separate network for each vocabulary word, allowing for faster optimization. It also enables incorporating side information like part of speech tags in specific layers. This approach extends word embeddings to capture both semantic and syntactic properties for improved performance. The model utilizes exponential family embeddings to extend word embeddings beyond text data, incorporating syntactic information through separate networks for each vocabulary word. This approach aims to improve performance by capturing both semantic and syntactic properties. The model word2net utilizes separate networks for each vocabulary word to capture semantic and syntactic properties. It outperforms popular embedding methods in predicting held-out words and incorporates syntactic information better than vector-based methods. The model is based on word embeddings methods and builds on deep neural network architectures. Word2net is a novel approach that represents words with functions instead of vectors or distributions. It uses separate networks for each vocabulary word, allowing for faster optimization and better performance in capturing semantic and syntactic properties. This method extends word embeddings to data beyond text, following the perspective of exponential family embeddings. Word2net extends word embeddings to capture semantic and syntactic properties by introducing Bernoulli embeddings. These embeddings use a log-bilinear form for exponential family likelihood, allowing for non-linear relationships. They improve word representations by leveraging syntactic information and can be generalized to other exponential family distributions like Poisson. Exponential family embeddings, specifically Bernoulli embeddings, parameterize the conditional probability of a target word given its context using embedding and context vectors. The goal is to learn these vectors from text by maximizing the log probability of words given their contexts, without imposing constraints on the sum over vocabulary words. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity. In Bernoulli embeddings, the objective is to learn embedding and context vectors from text by maximizing the log probability of words given their contexts. The objective function is a sum of log probabilities for all instances and vocabulary words, forming a bank of binary classifiers. The context vectors couple the classifiers together, with the objective being V independent logistic regressors predicting word appearance in a given context. Negative sampling is used to downweight zero contributions in the objective function. Replacing vectors with neural networks in word2net objective increases model capacity by capturing nonlinear relationships between context and cooccurrence probabilities. The bank of binary classifiers transforms context to different representations for linear separation of target word occurrences from negative examples. This results in a model with more parameters for enhanced capacity. Regularization techniques such as weight decay and parameter sharing are used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Word2net outperforms shallow models in fitting text data and capturing semantic similarities. Parameter sharing allows for the hierarchical structure of neural network representations to be exploited, enabling the use of tags for regularization. Parameter sharing in neural networks involves assigning words to different groups and sharing specific layers among words in the same group. This technique helps reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting without requiring side information. It can be applied to any text corpus and can improve the semantic structure of word2net when annotated with tags. Parameter sharing in neural networks involves assigning words to different groups and sharing specific layers among words in the same group to improve the semantic structure of word2net when annotated with tags. Andreas & Klein (2014) have shown that word embeddings may not encode much syntactic information, and it is still unclear how to utilize syntactic information to enhance word embeddings. The challenge lies in words having multiple meanings with different tags, requiring embedding models to capture these differences. Exploiting the hierarchical nature of network representations, information is incorporated through parameter sharing using one-hot vectors to model observations at specific positions in the text. Parameter sharing in neural networks involves leveraging tag information through one-hot vectors to model observations at specific positions in the text. This allows for the reduction of parameters necessary to describe layers, resulting in a more efficient network structure. The reduction of parameters in neural network layers from V to T is achieved through parameter sharing, specifically focusing on tag-specific and word-specific layers. The approach extends to side information beyond tags, emphasizing parameter sharing across all words or tags. In word2net, semantic similarities between word networks are computed using a metric that considers the similarity of functions mapping similar inputs to similar outputs. The procedure involves evaluating neural networks on a set of inputs and comparing their outputs using cosine distance to determine similarity. Semantic similarity between words/tags is computed using parameter sharing and a metric that considers functions mapping similar inputs to similar outputs. The method trained with tag sharing computes semantic similarity between word/tag pairs using a shared layer. Word2net outperforms existing models on Wikipedia articles and Senate speeches datasets, capturing semantic similarities and incorporating syntactic information for better predictions and word representations. The datasets include a vocabulary of common terms and tagged terms for analysis. Table 7 in Appendix C provides a tagset description and details on forming tagged datasets from Senate speeches. The datasets contain a large number of words and terms, with annotations done using the Stanford CoreNLP tagger. The datasets are split into training, validation, and test sets, with comparisons made to other models like BID11 and skip-gram. Shallow models have parameters per term, and experiments are conducted with different context sizes. Additional preprocessing details can be found in Appendix C. In comparing models based on context dimension K and total parameters, methods are fitted with various K values. Context sizes of 2, 4, and 8 are experimented with using stochastic gradient descent. Regularization and weight decay are applied during training, with Adam optimizer used for up to 30000 iterations. Context vectors are initialized from a pretrained embedding, and network parameters follow standard initialization schemes. Models with the same context dimension and total parameters are compared for different context sizes. Parameter sharing schemes are studied in word2net models to improve performance, especially with tags. Results show better predictive performance compared to skip-gram models. Different model sizes and parameter sharing approaches are explored, with quantitative results presented in tables for comparison. Word2net models with parameter sharing outperform shallow models and other methods, showing improved performance with shared parameters. Skip-gram models perform poorly when incorporating information from tagged words, requiring more data to capture cooccurrence patterns. Word2net with parameter sharing provides the best predictions across all methods, including other versions of word2net. In a qualitative analysis, word2net captures similarities and leverages syntactic information effectively. Word2net with parameter sharing excels over other methods, capturing similarities and leveraging syntactic information effectively. Comparisons between word networks trained on Wikipedia and Senate speeches show word2net's ability to capture latent semantics and incorporate syntactic information into learned representations. Word2net is a method for learning neural network representations of words, improving prediction accuracy over existing models. Parameter sharing enhances performance by sharing statistical strength across groups of words. Future research directions include exploring different ways of combining context information and types of parameter sharing. Another opportunity for future work is to explore different types of parameter sharing, such as sharing layers across documents or learning a latent group structure with word networks. Additional results not included in the main text due to space constraints are presented in TAB5, comparing the test log-likelihood of word2net with skip-gram and other models on the Wikipedia dataset. TAB6 shows the test log-likelihood for U.S. Senate speeches, where word2net with parameter sharing outperforms skip-gram. Word2vec is a widely used method for learning word vector representations with various implementation choices. Word2vec is a widely used method for learning word vector representations with different implementation choices. One way to implement word2vec is through the objectives of continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram, with a focus on achieving scalability through negative sampling. Bernoulli embeddings are related to skip-gram through Jensen's inequality, and with negative sampling by forming an unbiased estimate of the objective. The Bernoulli embeddings introduce an auxiliary coefficient for estimating word vectors, with differences in regularization and negative sample handling compared to skip-gram. Despite theoretical distinctions, practical performance between the two approaches is similar, with negative sampling used to predict context from target words. Negative sampling is used in skip-gram to predict context from target words, breaking the multi-class constraint and modeling probabilities of individual entries in one-hot vectors. The skip-gram objective is given by Eq. 11."
