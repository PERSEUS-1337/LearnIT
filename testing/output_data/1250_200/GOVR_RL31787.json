    "content": "The U.S. Strategic Command considers information operations a core military competency, focusing on electromagnetic energy, cyber operations, and psychological operations to manipulate perceptions. The Department of Defense now views cyberspace as a domain for warfare, defined as a global network of information technology infrastructures. This definition aligns with the 2008 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. Cyberspace operations are a component of Information Operations (IO) and include computer network operations to achieve military objectives. Each service has organizations with IO and Electronic Warfare (EW) responsibilities, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, Army Reserve Information Operations Command, U.S. Army IO Proponent, and Air Force's 24th Air Force. The 24th Air Force, previously a major Cyber Command, is now a Numbered Air Force under the Air Force Space Command, responsible for cyberwarfare, electronic warfare, and protecting critical infrastructure networks. Information Operations (IO) are viewed as a weapon and target in warfare, with Psychological Operations (PSYOP) used to influence decision-making and deter aggression. The impact of IO can extend beyond intended targets, affecting noncombatants and creating higher-order effects in today's conflict environment. New technologies for military information operations (IO) create new national security policy issues, including psychological operations on friendly nations and possible accusations of war crimes against the U.S. Insurgents use electronic devices like cell phones to detonate bombs and influence public opinion through media broadcasts. The growth of the Internet has increased the importance of electronic warfare (EW) and IO in modern conflicts. The report discusses adversary threats in the information environment, DOD capabilities for military information operations, federal cybersecurity efforts, and policy issues. Adversaries use the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt, influence, and steal data. Current threats include the transmission of video images of attacks against U.S. troops to manipulate public opinion. The U.S. military's dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum is being challenged. Current threats to the United States include challenges to the US military's dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum, with terrorist groups using wireless electronics for attacks and peer competitors focusing on electronic warfare. Electronic media plays a significant role in influencing populations, with many preferring foreign satellite news stations over government-run broadcasts. Many Arabs prefer foreign satellite news stations like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya over U.S. sponsored news broadcasts, believing they are too closely managed by coalition powers. The Iraqi Governing Council's prohibition of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya from covering events in 2004 led to the perception of information manipulation by the Coalition Provisional Authority. Terrorist groups are challenging traditional media through the Internet, using sophisticated methods to spread their messages globally. Al-Qaeda utilizes a Global Islamic Media Unit for public outreach efforts. Cyber-based threats against U.S. information infrastructures are a growing concern for national security, with attacks on government systems increasing by 40% in 2008. The \"Moonlight Maze\" attacks in 1999 compromised sensitive military data and were traced back to Russia. Adversaries find cyberspace operations attractive due to low cost and anonymity, posing a challenge to the United States in asymmetrical warfare. In 2003, cyberattacks known as \"Titan Rain\" targeted DOD systems and contractors, suspected to originate from China. Sensitive military data was copied, prompting concerns about U.S. export-control laws. Subsequent attacks in 2006 and 2007 against the U.S. Naval War College and the Pentagon led to temporary disconnections from the Internet. The Pentagon faced cyberattacks in 2007, prompting temporary disconnection from the Internet. Lt. General Charles Croom warned of potential cyber threats to U.S. military operations. China, Russia, and other adversaries are developing capabilities to attack U.S. networks. China has reportedly downloaded significant data from military systems. China is enhancing its information operations capabilities, as per the Defense Department's report to Congress. The Chinese military is focusing on enhancing its information operations capabilities, specifically targeting enemy command and control systems. In 2007, Estonia's move of a Soviet-era war memorial led to riots by ethnic Russians and DDOS attacks on Estonian national websites. Estonia, known for its advanced IT infrastructure, faced significant disruptions due to the attacks. Estonia's advanced IT infrastructure faced crippling cyberattacks in 2007, disrupting basic services for citizens. Initially blamed on Russia, NATO sent experts to help protect government systems. Later analysis suggested the attacks were not coordinated but fueled by spontaneous anger. The source of the attacks was worldwide, with the DDOS code shared in Russian chat rooms. Despite various government agencies being taken offline, there was no apparent targeting of national critical infrastructure. In 2007, Estonia faced cyberattacks targeting government agencies and internet resources. Analysts found no Russian government connection to the attacks. Meanwhile, Georgia experienced cyber attacks during a kinetic attack by Russian forces, with internet service providers being targeted. The attacks on Georgian sites exploited software vulnerabilities and were not as widespread as the Estonian DDOS attacks. The Georgian government blocked internet traffic from Russia in response. The Georgian government blocked internet traffic from Russian users to mitigate cyber attacks during a kinetic attack by Russian forces. Blogs provided instructions on bypassing the block, possibly encouraged by Russian officials. Kyrgyzstan's internet service providers were targeted with denial of service attacks, possibly by a Russian \"cyber militia,\" affecting the country's online presence. Motives included Russia's displeasure with a U.S. air base in Kyrgyzstan and the opposition party relying on the internet for media. The uncertainty in identifying attackers after cyber network attacks can impact decisions on retaliation. Cyberattacks are increasingly used for political manipulation, raising questions on international response protocols. NATO and states view network protection as a national duty, but issues of sovereignty, attribution, and response thresholds persist. Rules of engagement for cyber warfare are expected to align with the laws of Armed Conflict, ensuring proportional responses to electronic attacks. The military's response to cyber attacks follows the law of Armed Conflict, with retaliatory measures scaled in proportion to the attack. Offensive tools used for retaliatory strikes are classified, and a reactive defense is not effective against cyber attacks. Incorporating predictive, active, and pre-emptive measures is more effective in defending against cyber attacks. Accurate attribution is crucial in deciding on retaliation, with many attacks suspected to originate from China. Attacks suspected to originate in China are more numerous and sophisticated, primarily targeting DOD and U.S. civilian agency systems for cyberespionage. Unauthorized access to sensitive technology and DOD operations is common, with attempts to implant malicious code for future use. Defining the legality of responses to cyber behavior is challenging due to the difficulty in identifying attackers' intent and motivations. The terms \"cybercrime\" and \"cyberterrorism\" are problematic as they can be broad and may involve factors beyond just hacking. Various definitions exist for these terms. \"Cyberterrorism events may depend on factors beyond just cyberattacks. Definitions for cyberterrorism vary, with some focusing on politically motivated hacking for harm, while others include physical attacks on critical infrastructures. Deliberate attacks on computer facilities for political purposes can also be considered cyberterrorism.\" Cyberterrorism involves politically motivated hacking or physical attacks on critical infrastructures. Cybercrime, enabled by computers, includes theft of intellectual property and attacks to disrupt processing. The intent of the attacker distinguishes between cybercrime and cyberterrorism, with potential overlap between the two. Cybercrime, such as identity theft, is a prevalent form of cyberattack motivated by financial gain. Malicious code can gather personal information from users through tempting links, leading to the creation of false identity documents sold in online markets. False identity documents can be created using personal information obtained through cybercrime, leading to identity theft involving thousands of victims. Inadequate computer security practices enable hackers to access credit card numbers, with reports of fraudulent charges and victims of fraud. Additionally, personal information of employees from the National Nuclear Security Administration was stolen in a network intrusion. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) employees' data was stolen in a network intrusion that went unnoticed for a year. Stolen credit card and bank account information are traded online, with services offering to change billing addresses using stolen PINs or passwords. In 2005, services for each stolen MasterCard number cost between $42 and $72, but by 2007, a stolen credit card number sold for only $1. Identity packages, including a U.S. bank account number, credit card number, date of birth, and government-issued ID number, sold for $14 to $18. As of January 2007, 35 states have data security laws requiring businesses to notify affected persons and enhance security measures. The U.S. government faces challenges with identity theft and data breaches, leading to the compromise of confidential information. Incidents such as the intrusion on monster.com in 2007 and the data breach at the Federal Aviation Administration in 2009 highlight the need for improved security measures and timely notification of affected individuals. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of existing laws and regulations in protecting sensitive data. In February 2009, the Air Force shut down internet access at Maxwell Air Force Base due to a security breach. The Army also announced a breach of a database containing personal information of soldiers in March 2009. These incidents underscore the importance of information security measures. Cyberespionage involves unauthorized probing, viewing, copying, and exfiltration of data files. Industrial espionage and espionage for military information qualify as cyberespionage. Technology has outpaced policy in labeling actions in cyberspace. U.S. counterintelligence officials report about 140 foreign intelligence organizations attempt to hack into U.S. government and company systems. Cyberespionage enables the extraction of massive amounts of information electronically. Cyberespionage has transformed counterintelligence by reducing reliance on conventional spying operations. The Echelon electronic spy network, operated by the US and its allies, is accused of engaging in industrial espionage against European businesses. Former CIA director James Woolsey has justified the possibility of US industrial espionage based on the use of bribery by European countries. James Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, has justified the possibility of U.S. industrial espionage due to bribery by European companies. European parliament officials expressed outrage, acknowledging that bribery is sometimes used in sales. Concerns are raised about cyberespionage tools being sold by criminals, posing a risk to U.S. national security. Security experts emphasize the need for stronger government agency computer security practices to prevent cyber attacks. According to an August 2005 IBM security report, over 237 million security attacks were reported globally in the first half of the year. Government agencies were the most targeted with 54 million attacks, followed by manufacturing with 36 million, financial services with 34 million, and healthcare with 17 million attacks. The United States, New Zealand, and China were the top targets. The true number of attacks is likely higher than reported. The connection between cybercrime and terrorism is challenging to determine, but there are links between terrorist groups and criminals that facilitate international expansion through various means. Terrorist groups leverage criminal networks for international expansion, using resources like computer systems and money laundering. Examples include the 2005 U.K. bombings and 2007 car bombing attempts. London police suspect terrorists obtained explosives from Eastern European criminal groups. A trial in the U.K. revealed links between Islamic terrorists and cybercrime, with individuals using stolen credit card information to purchase supplies for jihadists. The trio used stolen credit cards to purchase items for jihadists, including night vision goggles, tents, GPS devices, prepaid cell phones, and airline tickets. They also laundered money through online gambling sites, totaling over $3.5 million from 37,000 stolen credit card numbers. Cybercriminals have alliances with drug traffickers to support terrorist groups through activities like credit card theft. Drug traffickers use encryption for communication and hire computer specialists to evade law enforcement and launder money. Regions with major narcotics markets like Western Europe and North America have optimal technology infrastructure that criminal and terrorist groups use to coordinate drug shipments and launder money. Reports from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Research Division at the Library of Congress show a growing involvement of terrorist groups in drug trafficking, with some groups using drug trafficking to finance their activities and weaken their enemies. DEA officials argue that the war on drugs and terrorism are interconnected. The poppy crop in Afghanistan supplies over 90% of the world's heroin, generating a $3.1 billion drug trade. Money from drug trafficking funds terrorist groups in the country, with reports indicating a resurgence of \"al Qaeda in Afghanistan\" post-9/11. Drug traffickers hire skilled computer specialists to evade detection and operate internationally. Many of these specialists come from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent countries. Many skilled computer specialists from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent countries may be hired by drug traffickers to evade detection. Some specialists may unknowingly work for criminal or terrorist organizations, while others may provide assistance due to limited legitimate job opportunities in their region. Links between computer hackers and terrorists are difficult to confirm, with exclusive hacker groups operating in secrecy and sharing sophisticated tools. Hacker groups may have various motivations, including political, profit-driven, or linked to organized crime. Hackers may be motivated by profit or political ideologies, with some willing to sell computer services to organized crime groups. Information on computer vulnerabilities is sold on the black market, with prices ranging from $150 to $5,000. Advanced cyberattacks may require years of preparation. A complex coordinated cyberattack, causing mass disruption against integrated systems, may require 6 to 10 years of preparation. Hackers devote extensive planning before launching cyberattacks, similar to physical terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda. It is uncertain if international terrorist groups have the interest or capabilities for effective cyberattacks. Some believe terrorist groups may use severe cyberattacks to supplement traditional attacks. Al Qaeda prioritizes attacks inflicting human casualties over cyberattacks. Post-industrial societies like Europe and the United States are more likely to consider cyberterrorism. Al Qaeda has improved organizational secrecy through technology, using the Internet extensively for planning operations. Members have used Internet-based services and encryption to communicate and protect data. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef utilized technology for coordinating attacks and bomb detonation. Terrorist groups may consider cyberattacks as a way to lower the risk of detection for their operations, but some experts believe that unless it results in physical damage or bloodshed, it will not be as serious as conventional attacks. There are concerns about potential attacks on critical infrastructures like the electric grid or SCADA systems, either through kinetic or cyber means. Cybercrime poses a major international challenge, with varying attitudes on what constitutes criminal computer wrongdoing. The Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2001, requires countries to update their laws against hacking, copyright infringements, fraud, child pornography, and other cyber activities. The United States has ratified the Convention but did not sign a protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism online due to Constitutional concerns. The United States did not sign a protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism online due to Constitutional concerns, as it could infringe on freedom of expression. Despite objections from groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the U.S. Senate ratified the Convention on Cybercrime in 2006, with the country expected to comply based on existing federal law. The United States ratified the Convention on Cybercrime in 2006, with compliance based on existing federal law. Legal analysts note that objectionable provisions were removed, aligning the Convention with U.S. laws. The Department of Defense acknowledges the threat of cyber attacks and the need for cybersecurity protection. The Department of Homeland Security coordinates efforts to safeguard critical infrastructure, as outlined in reports from 2005. Some observers question the lack of national urgency to close the gap between cybersecurity and the threat of cyberattack, despite reports highlighting the need to reduce vulnerabilities. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2007 that cybersecurity risks have increased for infrastructure control systems due to internet interconnections and lack of a coordinated strategy for improving computer security across federal agencies and the private sector. The report highlights the lack of an overall strategy to improve computer security across federal agencies and the private sector, leaving critical infrastructure vulnerable to cybercrime. Decision-makers may not see cybercrime as a significant threat, despite past reports emphasizing the need for urgent action. Researchers argue that the costs of inaction are not felt by current decision-makers, and IT vendors should prioritize security as a product attribute. The Air Force's new mission statement in 2008 includes operating in the cyber domain to defend against malicious activity on the Internet and across the electromagnetic spectrum. Former Secretary of the Air Force emphasized the importance of cyberwarfare as a natural extension of the Air Force's mission. The Air Force is expanding its capabilities to include cyberwarfare as a new mission, with plans for a new Air Force Cyber Command to defend against threats in the cyber domain. This includes protecting national security, telecommunications systems, utilities, and transportation. Considerations include the skills and training needed for staff at the Cyber Command and career paths for Air Force personnel interested in defending the cyber domain. The Air Force is establishing a new cyber warfare mission with the creation of the 24th Air Force, led by a 2-star general, focusing on cyberspace warfighting operations in support of NORTHCOM and STRATCOM missions. The AFCYBER (P) team will assist in transitioning responsibilities to Air Force Space Command, operating on an equal footing with other Numbered Air Force headquarters. The new organizational construct for cyberspace operations is still being formalized, with potential for a new major command or stand-alone combatant command. Currently, USSTRATCOM controls military information operations, space command, and Computer Network Operations, with daily defense activities delegated to the National Security Agency. Future command relationships are being decided in ongoing planning efforts. The Joint Functional Component Commands (JFCCs) are responsible for various aspects of DOD cyber security, including space and global strike integration, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, network warfare, integrated missile defense, and combating weapons of mass destruction. The Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) play key roles in defending against cyber attacks and coordinating network operations. The need for qualified Electronic Warfare operators is growing as more U.S. military systems become computerized and interconnected. The President's Comprehensive National Cyber-security Initiative emphasizes cyber education and training as a critical focus area. The need for qualified Electronic Warfare operators is increasing as more U.S. military systems become computerized and linked to networks. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordan England highlighted the decline in scientists and engineers in the U.S., posing a long-term threat to the country's cyber networks. Efforts are being made to integrate cyber warfare into Joint Professional Military Education curriculum, despite challenges such as the classified nature of cyberspace doctrine and the presence of international students in military academies. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cyber Operations Branch offers a 10-week summer program in cyber security for university students, including Air Force and Army pre-commissioning programs, National Science Foundation Cyber Corps Fellows, and civilian college students. The program, held in Rome, NY, focuses on legal and policy issues, cryptography, computer network defense and attack, steganography, and analysis of malicious code. The theme for 2006 was \"Cybercraft,\" aligning with the Air Force's mission to operate in air, space, and cyberspace. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cyber Operations Branch offers a 10-week summer program in cyber security for university students, focusing on legal and policy issues, cryptography, computer network defense and attack, steganography, and analysis of malicious code. The program is recognized by DHS and NSF as an official internship program for Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. Graduates are required to work for a federal agency for two years. Recent ACE graduates are now working at the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the AFRL, and the NSA. Syracuse University also developed a cyber security course for high schools in New York State. In September 2006, Syracuse University introduced a cyber security course in 12 high schools in New York State, expanding to 148 high schools in various states. High school students completing the course can earn college credits. The Department of Defense (DOD) collaborates with Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute and DHS to monitor cyber threats and provide recovery guidance. DOD emphasizes the need to protect internet-based commerce due to its significance. The Defense Information Systems Agency oversees the military's Global Information Grid (GiG) and supports net-centric operations through JTF-GNO. GiG 2.0 initiative aims to improve security postures and interoperability by creating a joint DOD enterprise. The federal government has taken steps to enhance computer security and encourage private sector to adopt stronger policies. FISMA was enacted in 2002 to improve information security management. In 2002, FISMA was enacted to improve information security management, with OMB coordinating security standards. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003 aimed to enhance computer security for critical infrastructure. The OMB mandated IPv6 adoption for government networks to improve security and address exhaustion of IP addresses. IPv6 offers built-in network security features, but full operational transition is still pending. Federal agencies are now supporting the IPv6 protocol for improved security, but full operational transition is still a future goal. The National Cyber Security Division oversees a Cyber Security Tracking, Analysis and Response Center for analyzing cyber threats and issuing alerts. Additionally, a new Cyber Warning and Information Network serves as an early warning system for cyberattacks, designed to be reliable and survivable without dependency on the Internet or public switched network. The National Cyber Alert System was also created to distribute information to subscribers for cybersecurity prioritization. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) created the National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) in 2004 to distribute information on emerging cyber threats. The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) was launched in 2008 by President George W. Bush to prioritize and coordinate cyber defense efforts across the government. The initiative was led by the Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force and continued by the Obama administration with a cybersecurity review led by Melissa Hathaway. The cybersecurity review, led by Melissa Hathaway, is evaluating the government's cybersecurity efforts. There is a debate over whether NSA or DHS should lead cybersecurity, with concerns about civil liberties violations and private sector cooperation. Critics also point out that DHS's cyber programs are underfunded. The DHS's cyber programs are criticized for being inadequately funded, with concerns about leadership authority. The director of the NCSC resigned over NSA dominance in cybersecurity efforts. Experts suggest reforming the national security structure to address current challenges. Areas for congressional consideration include responses to cyberattacks, incentives for national cybersecurity goals, and improving commercial software security. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the CNCI aim to improve cybersecurity by enhancing commercial software security, increasing security education, and promoting coordination between private industry and government. Congress should also consider harmonizing laws on data breach notifications and obligations for businesses. Additionally, careful consideration is needed for the U.S. response to cyberattacks, especially in cases involving cyberweapons and potential unintended consequences. The potential consequences of the United States using cyberweapons, including the difficulty of controlling their effects, the risk of encouraging other entities to launch cyberattacks, and the possibility of violating international laws. The vulnerability of U.S. military systems to cyberattacks and the potential for adversaries to exploit this weakness. The potential consequences of using cyberweapons by the United States, including the risk of cyberattacks on U.S. military systems and the need for increased cybersecurity measures in commercial software systems. Suggestions for incentivizing the creation of less vulnerable commercial off-the-shelf products and the debate on whether regulation or voluntary action is needed to ensure network security. The debate on whether regulation is needed to improve computer security, with differing views from cybersecurity advisers. Some argue for market forces to drive better cybersecurity, while others believe the IT industry has not done enough. Suggestions include providing training for system administrators and requiring software vendors to create more secure products. Software product vendors may need to create higher quality, more secure products with fewer patches. Rethinking design and adding more test procedures during development could increase security. Government and private sector commitment to best management practices is crucial for improving computer security. Reports highlight the threat of cybercrime and recommend cybersecurity practices. A 2004 survey revealed that many home PC users lack adequate protection against hackers and are confused about security measures. Computer security training should be accessible to all users to keep them informed about evolving threats and promote proper security procedures. Improving the sharing of cybersecurity information is also essential. Improving cybersecurity requires sharing relevant information about threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits. Challenges include obtaining classified threat information from the government and private industry's reluctance to report successful intrusions. Coordination of security policies and international law is needed to protect against cyberattacks. Pursuing hackers may involve tracing back through networks. To better protect against cyberattacks, coordination of security policies and international law is crucial. Pursuing hackers may involve tracing back through networks, requiring cooperation from multiple countries. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime aims to combat cybercrime by harmonizing laws and enhancing international cooperation. However, the effectiveness of the Convention may be limited without the participation of countries where cybercriminals operate freely. H.R. 1525, the Internet Spyware (I-SPY) Prevention Act of 2007, proposed penalties for unauthorized computer access and crimes committed using computers. H.R. 1684 \u2014The Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established an Office of Cybersecurity and Communications within the Department of Homeland Security to oversee cybersecurity preparation, response, and reconstitution. The bill directed the Assistant Secretary to identify threats to critical information infrastructure, conduct risk assessments, and develop a plan for continuation of critical information operations in the event of a cyber attack. The bill H.R. 3237, known as The Smart Grid Facilitation Act of 2007, aims to modernize the Nation's electricity transmission and distribution system by incorporating digital information and controls technology to enhance cybersecurity against threats and terrorism. This bill passed the House on May 9, 2007, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 11, 2007. The Grid Modernization Commission would assess progress in modernizing the electric system, including cybersecurity for extended grid systems. Bills like H.R. 3221 and H.R. 1585 aimed to establish standards and practices for Smart Grid technology and cyber operations within the Department of Defense. The Committee on Armed Services report in 2008 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report within 180 days, focusing on legal authorities, information sharing policies, organizational structure, operational challenges, coordination with other entities, training requirements, and funding for cyberspace operations. The DOD Roles and Missions Review in 2009 emphasized the importance of cyberspace as a focus area. The DOD Roles and Missions Review report in 2009 highlighted cyberspace as a key focus area, stating that major combat operations may occur in this domain. Questions arise regarding the legality of provocative actions such as intelligence gathering using cyber or electronic warfare tools. Concerns include potential strong responses from targeted countries or extremist groups, as well as the justification of civilian infrastructure damage during a military cyberattack on a foreign government. The DOD is considering the legal justification for military actions in cyberspace and the potential impact of global media on public perception. There are concerns about the use of Information Operations and Psychological Operations (PSYOP) to manipulate opinions, both domestically and internationally. The DOD Information Operations Roadmap outlines the importance of achieving information superiority in future conflicts. The DOD Information Operations Roadmap, published in October 2003, highlights the challenge of controlling PSYOP messages intended for foreign audiences that are consumed by the U.S. domestic audience through global media. The document emphasizes the importance of achieving information superiority and discusses the blurred distinction between foreign and domestic audiences in information dissemination practices. The DOD utilizes databases to enhance shared awareness, synchronize command, control, and intelligence, and convert information superiority into combat power. Information Operations (IO) are actions taken during crisis or conflict to influence adversary information and defend one's own systems. IO attacks can disrupt adversary decision-making processes through various methods such as transmitting viruses, overheating computer circuitry, and broadcasting false signals. Psychological operations and network communication control are also used to influence target audiences and disrupt adversary unity of command. Computer Network Defense (CND) activities protect U.S. forces against Information Operations (IO) attacks. DOD emphasizes dominating the electromagnetic spectrum for network attack and electronic warfare. The military must be prepared to \"fight the net,\" possibly referring to the Internet. Psychological Operations and public diplomacy are crucial to counter adversaries' use of the Internet and global news media. The use of Psychological Operations (PSYOP) and public diplomacy is essential to counter adversaries' effective use of the Internet and global news media. DOD identifies five core capabilities for information operations: Psychological Operations, Military Deception, Operations Security, Computer Network Operations, and Electronic Warfare, which are integrated to achieve desired effects. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, broadcast messages were used to influence Iraqi leaders to abandon support for Saddam Hussein. The civilian Al Jazeera news network in Qatar competes with US PSYOP by reaching over 35 million viewers in the Middle East. Terrorist groups also use the Internet to spread their messages. The US needs a strategic communications strategy to counter civilian news media like Al Jazeera. DOD emphasizes improving PSYOP to target potential adversaries well in advance of conflicts, based on audience decision-making processes. PSYOP products must be rapidly produced and disseminated to targeted audiences. The DOD prohibits the use of PSYOP for targeting American audiences but acknowledges that global media may pick up messages intended for foreign audiences. Military Deception (MILDEC) guides enemies with false information to mislead them. Operational Security (OPSEC) identifies critical information to protect friendly operations. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, a Decoy system was used to divert Iraqi air defenses. Operational Security (OPSEC) is crucial for protecting friendly operations by identifying critical information. Computer Network Operations (CNO) involve attacking enemy networks, defending our own, and exploiting enemy networks for intelligence. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW) handle the evolving mission of Computer Network Attack, with highly classified capabilities. The DOD has not officially admitted to launching cyber attacks, but experts believe they can destroy and penetrate enemy networks. The DOD is believed to have the capability to launch cyber attacks against enemies, with personnel from various agencies and military branches. The Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) is under the Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) and will now be under the National Security Agency. Defensive measures, known as Computer Network Defense (CND), include monitoring, detecting, and responding to unauthorized computer activity. Responses to attacks may involve passive tools like firewalls or more intrusive actions. The DOD recommends a legal review to determine the level of intrusion that constitutes an attack in cyber warfare. They also suggest creating a legal framework for responding to attacks from domestic and foreign sources. The area of Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) within IO is not clearly defined within the DOD. Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) is an area of Information Operations (IO) that involves intelligence collection through network tools to gather information about system vulnerabilities. CNE is focused on data exfiltration, but it is unclear if the methods used could also be used for an attack. In contrast, Computer Network Attack (CNA) aims to disrupt or destroy information in computers and networks using a data stream as a weapon. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. and coalition forces did not execute any computer network attacks against Iraqi systems due to delayed top-level approval for several CNA missions. A planned cyber attack against Iraqi financial computers was rejected to avoid bringing down banks and ATM machines in Europe connected to Iraq's banking network. Global network interconnections posed challenges for information operations attacks. The Pentagon faced challenges in designing a cyber attack on Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Global network interconnections between Iraqi military systems and civilian infrastructure made it difficult to limit the attack to military targets only. White House officials sought input on cyber-warfare guidelines in 2003, proceeding cautiously due to potential cascading effects on civilian systems. The Bush Administration announced national-level guidance for launching computer network attacks against foreign adversaries in February 2003. National Security Presidential Directive 16 clarifies circumstances for justifying disabling computer attacks. Directive 16 clarifies circumstances for justifying disabling computer attacks and defines Electronic Warfare (EW) as military action involving electromagnetic spectrum energy to deceive or attack the enemy. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office is responsible for creating electronic warfare policy and supporting development of new electromagnetic spectrum concepts for equipment and weapons. DOD emphasizes maximum control of the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt communication systems, sensors, and weapons. The military focuses on controlling the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt communication systems, sensors, and weapons. This includes methods like navigation warfare, controlling adversary radio systems, and using non-kinetic weapons to disable enemy computer circuitry. Examples include secretly entering enemy computer networks, manipulating radar systems, and using High Power Microwave beams to disable enemy missiles. The military utilizes non-kinetic weapons like High Power Microwave (HPM) beams for disrupting enemy communication systems and disabling computer circuitry. The Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal directed energy weapon that projects millimeter energy waves to create a burning sensation on adversaries, repelling them without causing injury. The ADS has been deployed to Iraq for crowd control and protecting convoys, with approximately $40 million spent on its development over the past decade. The Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal directed energy weapon used in Iraq for crowd control and protecting convoys. Plans to deploy the ADS under Project Sheriff have been delayed due to political concerns, with initial deployment now scheduled for 2010. This system would be the first directed-energy weapon for counter-personnel missions."
