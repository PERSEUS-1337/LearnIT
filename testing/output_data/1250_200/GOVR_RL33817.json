    "content": "Human-driven climate change has shifted from a scientific topic to a policy debate, with Congressional proposals focusing on observation, pollution control, financial assistance for technology, and adaptation. Federal funding for climate change activities was $6.37 billion in FY2008, with a total budgetary impact of $7.73 billion including tax incentives. Funding for FY2009 remains at or below these levels, with a Continuing Resolution in place. Tax incentives for renewable energy passed in late 2008 may have affected budgetary impacts in FY2009. The 111th Congress evaluates federal funding and tax incentives for climate change. President Obama aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appointed Carol Browner for Energy and Climate Change. The new Administration's goals will impact climate change funding and policies. President Obama appointed Carol Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, with goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President Bush previously aimed to cut U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and announced a goal to halt increases in emissions by 2025 through regulatory measures and market incentives. Funding proposals and program alignment under the new leadership will determine the implementation of these goals. The Obama Administration aims to encourage the use of clean technologies through regulatory measures and market incentives. Specific outcome-oriented performance targets have been set for some programs, but most requested climate-related funding lacks quantitative greenhouse gas, science, or technology performance targets. The appropriation of funds by Congress alters the total amount and distribution of funding requested by the President to address climate change across agencies and activities. Consideration may be given to clearer relationships among programs, their funding, and their contributions to meeting measurable climate change goals. The appropriations process lacks coordination across subcommittees or at the committee level, hindering a broad view of climate change policy goals and priorities. Federal funding for climate change activities has evolved since 1990, with emphasis on changes from FY2007 and FY2008 to President Bush's FY2009 request. A Continuing Resolution extended FY2008 enacted levels through March 6, 2009. The availability and clarity of funding information continue to impede full understanding of the federal effort and its effectiveness. The limited political agreement on climate change in the United States has led to activities being packaged as research or international assistance. There has been a historical emphasis on climate change science, but calls for greater action on GHG abatement, impacts assessment, and adaptation may change federal priorities. The U.S. effort to address climate change has been influenced by concerns from the research community. Funding for climate change science has fluctuated over the years, with a consensus emerging on the need for continued research and support for technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Major changes in energy and technology are seen as necessary to avoid human-induced climate change. Consensus has emerged on federal support for clean technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy. President Clinton and President Bush implemented initiatives like the Climate Change Technology Initiative and the Climate Change Technology Program. These technology programs now make up two-thirds of climate change funding. Developing countries also require financial and technical assistance to adopt cleaner economic paths, as agreed upon in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Bush established a $25 million Country Studies Program in 1992 to support this effort. President George H.W. Bush established a $25 million Country Studies Program in 1992 to assist developing and transition countries in implementing climate change policies. Most international assistance funding has been through US AID and has decreased since the late 1990s. The report provides an overview of climate change funding in science, technology, and international assistance, as well as tax provisions to reduce greenhouse gases. There are overlaps and gaps among these program areas, and alternative categorizations may be more beneficial for decision-making. The report also identifies legislative issues related to federal funding for climate change programs. The report discusses federal funding for climate change programs and activities, including legislative issues. Funding has been allocated to three major program areas: Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP), and International Assistance. Funding levels have fluctuated over the years, with notable increases in FY2008 and FY2009 for new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing. The federal government offers tax incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with an estimated total of $1.52 billion in climate change-related tax expenditures in FY2008 and FY2007. These tax expenditures are projected to decrease to $1.44 billion in FY2009. Examples include credits for purchases of cleaner automobiles. The federal government provides tax incentives for climate change-related activities, such as credits for cleaner automobiles and renewable energy investments. Table 1 shows the budget impact of climate change programs and tax expenditures from FY2001 to FY2008, indicating an 85% increase in budgetary impact. The majority of the increase is attributed to technology research and development. The federal government has seen a $4.3 billion increase in budgetary impact from FY2001 to FY2008, with over 60% attributed to technology research and development. An additional $1.5 billion is due to tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. President Bush's FY2009 budget request aimed to bring funding levels back to FY2001 levels in real terms. Budget authority for climate change activities in FY2008 was $5.44 billion, with a proposed increase to $7.15 billion in FY2009. Resolution (CR) (P.L. 110-329) extended FY2008 enacted levels through March 6, 2009 for climate-related programs. Funding levels varied from requested amounts. No information on changes for FY2009 climate change funding yet. Tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions were extended in late 2008. Major changes requested for FY2009 included increased funding for nuclear energy, fossil energy research, and satellite sensors for climate-related measurements. Grants to low-income households decreased by $227 million. Funding for satellite sensors for climate-related measurements increased by $177 million in NASA and NOAA budgets. An initial $400 million installment, with a proposed $2 billion over five years, was allocated to a new Clean Technology Fund hosted by the World Bank. Proposed increases focus on observational capacities and basic technological research, rather than policy or management research. Some programs for impacts and adaptation, such as abrupt climate change and drought research in NOAA, received less funding. In FY2009, funding for climate change programs was divided into three areas: Climate Change Science Program ($2.08 billion), Climate Change Technology Program ($4.42 billion), and International Climate Change Assistance ($0.66 billion). The Bush Administration did not propose to continue certain programs funded by Congress in FY2008, such as the $3.4 million for developing a greenhouse gas emission registry. The budget authority for these programs has increased since FY2007. The federal climate change programs in FY2009 were divided into three areas: Climate Change Science Program, Climate Change Technology Program, and International Climate Change Assistance. Funding growth primarily supported technology research, demonstration, and deployment, with a significant increase in nuclear energy research. Understanding the specific uses of climate change funds can be challenging due to unreported or unclear funding levels for specific activities. In FY2009, federal climate change programs focused on Climate Change Science, Technology, and International Assistance. Understanding the specific uses of climate change funds is challenging due to unreported funding levels. A large portion of the FY2009 funding request could not be determined. Nuclear energy research received the largest share of climate-related funding at $1.40 billion, followed by satellite-based observations at $843 million. Satellite-based observations account for 11.8% of federal climate change funding in FY2009, totaling $843 million. This funding represents 40.5% of the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) budget. However, these funds do not cover essential aspects like data quality assurance, management, and accessibility for researchers. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) receive the majority of climate change budget authority, totaling 74% of the request. The FY2009 budget for climate change science under the CCSP requested $2.08 billion, an increase from previous years. The CCSP has been managing scientific research on climate change since 2003. President Bush's request was 12% higher than the FY2008 budget and 14% higher than the FY2007 level. Funding details by agency for the CCSP and CCTP can be found in Appendices D and E. The FY2009 budget for climate change science under the CCSP requested $2.08 billion, an increase from previous years. President Bush's request was 12% higher than the FY2008 budget and 14% higher than the FY2007 level. NASA would receive the largest share of funding, with 64% proposed for space-based observations. NOAA, NSF, and DOE would also receive portions of the funding. The history of U.S. funding for climate change science since FY1989 is detailed in Figure 3 and Appendix C. The CCSP budget declined by 11% from FY2001 to FY2008, down 25% from the peak in FY1995. NASA's climate-related budget decreased by 24% from FY2000 to FY2008, with an increase proposed for space-based observations in FY2009. NOAA was the only agency to see an increase in climate science funding during this period. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was the only agency to see an increase in climate science funding during the time period, with a 217% increase in budget. Federally-supported research on climate change has been ongoing for decades, with funding peaking in FY1995 at $2.28 billion before declining to $1.83 billion in FY2008. The funding for climate change science peaked in FY1995 at $2.28 billion before declining to $1.83 billion in FY2008. The Global Change Research Act established the U.S. Global Change Research Program, leading to tension over the goals and balance of federally supported climate change science. The U.S. Global Change Research Program aims to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science, expand global observing systems, and communicate findings broadly. However, it has been criticized for focusing mainly on physical science and neglecting behavioral, economic, and ecological aspects of environmental problems. Key priorities include understanding the role of clouds in climate change and the ocean-land-atmosphere interface. The program's current structure may provide valuable information for predicting climate change but lacks ecosystem-scale research, adaptation research, and integrated assessments. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has been criticized for neglecting ecosystem-scale research, adaptation research, and integrated assessments. Critics argue that structural changes are needed as efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Proposals to restructure and expand climate change research are being considered within and outside of the U.S. Congress. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) includes the US GCRP and the Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI), with little practical distinction between the two efforts. The CCSP has not been formalized through legislation. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has not been formalized through legislation, with ongoing reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The program is described in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, which was updated in 2008. The strategic plan grouped research into seven elements and did not substantially change the organization of the existing CCSP. Bills to amend or replace the legal authorization for U.S. federal climate change science may be introduced in the future. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is outlined in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, which includes seven research elements. The plan also lays out five goals for improving knowledge of Earth's climate and environment, with proposed FY2009 funding for each goal provided. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) aims to explore the uses and limits of evolving knowledge to manage risks and opportunities related to climate variability and change. Funding levels do not cover all federal climate-related science, and some activities within CCSP may only be tangentially related to climate change. Challenges in identifying work and funding directed at climate change science arise from reporting issues and the absorption of the pre-established Global Change Research Program. Proposed funding would mainly support satellite-based observations, basic science research, and climate models. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) requires scientific assessment reports to Congress every four years, with the first national assessment published in December 2000. The CCSP Strategic Plan aimed to produce 21 Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs) by 2007, but there were disagreements on meeting statutory requirements. Environmental groups sued the Bush Administration to force a revised research plan and an integrated national scientific assessment. The Bush Administration was sued to release a revised research plan and national scientific assessment. The Administration complied with a court order by releasing the CCSP Revised Research Plan in 2008, focusing on the period from 2008 to 2010. The plan aimed to develop a new strategy by 2010 covering 2013 to 2023, with public outreach already underway. The RRP maintained the same goals and structure as the 2003 Strategy, emphasizing the importance of understanding Earth's climate and improving knowledge of climate processes. The CCSP is committed to ongoing research to understand climate processes and their impacts on ecosystems, human health, infrastructure, and other systems. They aim to support decision-making related to climate variability and change, with a focus on regional and local scales. Communication with stakeholders is a priority to ensure research results are widely accessible. The CCSP aims to make research results widely accessible. Legislative options may clarify goals and processes for federal climate change research. The CCSP will release the Unified Synthesis Product to analyze current understanding of climate change science. Multiple agencies are involved in reviewing and improving the climate science program. The CCSP lacks sufficient overarching authority to overcome agencies' individual interests and make budgets consistent with cross-cutting priorities, hindering progress in the climate science program. There is no general consensus on how to strengthen central leadership, with some suggesting legislative actions to invest authority in entities like the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Options for central leadership in climate change programs include the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of Management and Budget, National Science Foundation, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Suggestions range from a \"climate czar\" in the White House to a new standalone entity. Debate surrounds whether leadership should focus solely on science programs or extend to all climate change initiatives, including energy security coordination. President Obama's appointment of Carol Browner as Assistant for Energy and Climate Change may address this need, but the role's functions and authority remain undefined. President Obama's appointment of Carol Browner as Assistant for Energy and Climate Change may address the lack of clearly defined and measurable goals in the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). The program lacks measurable objectives for overall progress, leading to challenges in setting priorities and evaluating contributions to climate change policy objectives. This highlights the tension between funding for fundamental knowledge and calls for more resources for applied research. A National Academies panel has been convened to consider how to measure progress for the program. The National Academies panel noted challenges in measuring progress for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) due to the lack of measurable objectives in the Strategic Plan. Metrics could be developed but would be costly and challenging to implement. A 2008 review highlighted the program's unclear reporting and reliance on qualitative goals. Unclear and inconsistent reporting of climate change funding persists despite some improvements recommended by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2005. The lack of clarity and consistency hinders understanding of how funds are used and evaluating their efficiency. The National Academies panel in 2007 also highlighted the challenge of obtaining detailed budget and management information for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). The 2008 National Research Council report evaluated priorities for space-based observations, emphasizing the need to address the imbalance between space-based and other research components. It highlighted the importance of integrating observations from land, sea, air, and space into forecast models for effective decision-making. The report identified weaknesses in current observation systems and emphasized the need for continuous observations over individual space missions to improve analysis and usefulness. The NRC panel emphasized the need for continuous observations over individual space missions to improve analysis and usefulness. They recommended focusing resources on sustained observations, complementary non-space-based observations, turning observations into knowledge, and sustaining the knowledge system. The panel also highlighted the importance of addressing funding imbalances for satellite-based observations and other observation systems. The USGCRP has been criticized for prioritizing observation and research over providing useful information to policymakers. Oversight committees for carbon cycle science are mainly composed of scientists, with little input from policymakers. The focus on basic research is seen as hindering the potential for societal benefits. The USGCRP has been criticized for prioritizing observation and research over providing useful information to policymakers. Changes in operating norms may be necessary for research agencies to focus more on societal needs. The National Research Council emphasized the importance of involving users in determining priorities for NASA products. The CCSP may need adjustments to achieve its goal of producing information for climate change strategies. Various interest groups have proposed restructuring the CCSP to enhance its effectiveness. Several proposals have been suggested to restructure the CCSP, including giving more central authority to one agency or the White House, increasing budgetary control, involving potential users of the science, and improving budget decision-making. Some proposals aim to expand the science program to include more applied research and analysis for private and government needs, as well as increase public communications and outreach. In the 1990s, federal research on energy technologies and carbon storage was seen as crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Clinton and President Bush both initiated programs to address climate change technology. President Bush repackaged activities into the U.S. Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) in 2002, which was authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Committee on Climate Change Technology was established to integrate federal climate reports and promote greenhouse gas reducing technologies. A $3 billion CCTP Strategic Plan was published in September 2006. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Climate Change Technology Program within the Department of Energy, with activities including preparing inventories of GHG reducing technologies, identifying technology demonstration projects, developing standards for GHG intensity, supporting demonstration projects, and entering into research agreements. This program was part of President Bush's U.S. Climate Change Technology Program, which had a $3 billion Strategic Plan published in September 2006. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) under President Bush aimed to accelerate technological advances for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The program included activities such as developing standards, supporting demonstration projects, and entering research agreements. The CCTP had six strategic goals focused on advancing technologies to reduce emissions from energy use, capture carbon dioxide, and improve measurement capabilities. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) aimed to accelerate technological advances for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy end-use, infrastructure, carbon capture, non-CO2 greenhouse gases, measurement capabilities, and technology development. Federal funding for climate change technology increased significantly from $845 million in FY1993 to $4.53 billion in FY2008. However, the actual increase in funding may be lower due to redefined initiatives within the CCTP over time, making it challenging to track specific climate change technology evolution. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) aimed to accelerate technological advances for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Federal funding for climate change technology increased significantly over the years, but changes in reporting make it difficult to track funding trends and program evolution. GAO has noted discrepancies in technology funding reporting, leading to uncertainty in funding trends. Funding for CCTP is presented by agency and program, with data showing that reported funds are a subset selected according to OMB guidelines. According to data, 29% of funds requested for the CCTP for FY2009 would support nuclear energy, which is more than twice the amount requested for any other technology category. The next largest categories are mixes of technologies and renewable energy technologies other than biomass and biofuels. Funding highlights the Administration's priorities for specific technologies planned for development by DOE and EPA under the CCTP. There is broad support for federal interventions to stimulate technological advance for effectively stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. technology strategy has been focused on federal sponsorship of research on specified technologies, but there is no clear relationship between federal investment in particular technologies and success in commercialization. The CCTP supports technological advance at all stages of research, development, demonstrations, and deployment. More than two-thirds of CCTP funding supports basic research and development of specific technologies. Federal programs encourage deployment of technologies through targeted information and technical assistance. Only a small portion of CCTP funding supports technology deployment in the United States. A small portion of CCTP funding, around 5%, is allocated for technology deployment in the United States. Congress appropriates funds to DOE, EPA, and USDA for over 60 programs promoting the adoption of efficient or greenhouse gas-reducing technologies. DOE represents 87% of the new budget authority for CCTP in the FY2009 request. The FY2009 request for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) allocated funding to various agencies, with USDA, DOD, and NASA receiving the highest percentages. President Bush's climate change strategy also included International Climate Change Assistance to encourage global engagement in greenhouse gas mitigation. Developing countries' participation in addressing climate change post-2012 depends on industrialized countries fulfilling their commitments under the UNFCCC. The United States, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, is urged to provide financial and technological assistance to lower-income and vulnerable countries to address climate change. President Bush proposed a significant increase in funding for international climate change programs, including a $400 million contribution to the Clean Technology Fund managed by the World Bank. Other countries also pledged financial support for climate change initiatives. At a meeting, various countries pledged up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) of the World Bank, including the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund. These funds aim to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change adaptation. The Strategic Climate Fund will test innovative approaches to climate change, starting with a pilot program to increase climate resilience in developing nations. The Climate Investment Funds (CIF) of the World Bank received pledges of up to $6.14 billion from various countries to support developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The funds include a pilot program to increase climate resilience, with plans for additional programs like the Forest Investment Program and Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program. The financing aims to fulfill commitments of the United States and other developed countries for financial assistance to developing nations, supplementing obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Discussions have arisen regarding which technologies to finance, which countries should receive assistance, and the goal of transforming energy economies. Increased assistance to developing countries is seen as crucial for reducing their greenhouse gas trajectories. President Bush's request aimed to increase international climate change assistance through USAID by $50 million, from $115 million enacted for FY2008 to a proposed $165 million in FY2009. A Continuing Resolution extended the FY2008 funding level through March 6, 2009. The FY2009 requested amount would still be lower than the level of $190 million enacted for FY2006, with a decrease due to $28 million eliminated for \"modern energy services\" in Afghanistan. USAID does not differentiate funding for measuring, monitoring, reporting, verification, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other activities in relevant sectors. The international assistance category in the FY2009 request included $52 million. In the FY2009 request, international assistance included $52 million for the Department of State to support the Asia Pacific Partnership (APP). Additional funding for the APP was requested for other agencies like the Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency. However, both the House and Senate rejected the request to fund the APP, consistent with past appropriations. The partnership aims to advance technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) is a voluntary partnership involving the United States, Canada, China, India, South Korea, Australia, and Japan to advance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue it may divert from UN cooperation, but technological advances in developing countries are crucial for reducing emissions. Under the UNFCCC, wealthier countries committed to providing financial resources to help developing countries meet their obligations. In federal climate change funding, $26 million was reported for FY2009 as the United States' contribution to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the World Bank. The GEF supports clean energy projects. The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) was set up to assist the poorest countries in adapting to climate change, with a Senate-passed bill for foreign operations proposing $20 million for the LDC Fund in FY2009. The United States did not enact the proposed $20 million contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) for FY2009. Additionally, the United States has not contributed to the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) or the Adaptation Fund (AF) established by the UNFCCC Parties and the Kyoto Protocol, respectively. The United States is not obligated to contribute to the Adaptation Fund (AF) but may face pressure to make voluntary contributions. Congress appropriating assistance to developing countries will influence the Department of State's ability to enhance U.S. credibility and engage developing countries in new GHG mitigation commitments. Providing assistance alone cannot guarantee developing countries will consider it measurable, reportable, and verifiable finance, technology, and capacity-building as called for under the Bali Action Plan of 2007. Controversy may arise over how multilateral funds are managed, whether financing is considered \"new and additional,\" conditions placed on the financing, and if funds are \"adequate\" and \"predictable.\" The United States encourages countries to conserve tropical rainforests to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and protect carbon dioxide removal by trees. This is done through debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. Tax provisions also support climate change activities by incentivizing investments in technologies that emit less greenhouse gases. In its federal expenditures reports, OMB enumerates tax expenditures related to incentives for investments in technologies emitting less greenhouse gases. OMB's estimates of tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007, primarily due to provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Projections show a decline in tax expenditures through 2013, with potential alterations due to extensions of renewable energy incentives in 2008. Tax provisions related to incentives for investments in technologies emitting less greenhouse gases may not be available predictably for a sufficiently long period for investors to take advantage of them for new facilities. This could reduce the effectiveness of tax incentives in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The existence of tax incentives for both low and high-GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the full cost of energy to consumers. Federal funding related to climate change has expanded over the past two decades to support various programs and objectives, including developing technologies, planning for adaptation, and assisting lower-income countries. The lack of an overarching policy goal for climate change has led to separate and evolving funding priorities. The U.S. federal policy on climate change lacks a single, integrated strategy and is a combination of separate goals for various sectors. President Obama aimed to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with former EPA Administrator Carol Browner appointed to oversee energy and climate change efforts. President Obama announced plans to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but funding proposals and program alignment are uncertain. The Executive Branch did not provide a consolidated annual report on climate change funding in 2008, and the absence of a cross-cut budget requirement continues into FY2009. Agencies vary in identifying and explaining climate-related activities in their budget justifications. The Congress may need to consider reinstating a reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives. Clear criteria and detailed information could improve the transparency and usefulness of annual reports on climate change funding. Budget justifications should provide clear information on changes to activities, stakeholders, and priorities to facilitate decision-making and trade-offs. To improve transparency and decision-making on climate change funding, detailed information on activities, stakeholders, and priorities should be provided. The traditional categorization of funding into science, technology, and international assistance may not accurately reflect the objectives of many programs. A different organization of budgetary information may be needed to meet the oversight and appropriations needs of Congress. To enhance transparency and decision-making on climate change funding, detailed information on activities, stakeholders, and priorities should be provided. A reorganization of budgetary information could align with climate change legislation in Congress and focus on measurable objectives. Evaluation of funded climate change efforts, particularly the Climate Change Science Program, has been conducted, but not at a more integrated level for programs like the Climate Change Technology Program or international assistance efforts. No comprehensive evaluation has been conducted on the federal effort in addressing climate change, including international assistance and broader foreign policy. Federal funding and tax incentives for climate change activities totaled $7.73 billion in FY2008, showing an 85% increase since FY2001. The majority of the increase is attributed to technology research and development, with a smaller portion due to new tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. Funding for climate change science has decreased by 23% after adjusting for inflation. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) funding decreased by 23% from FY2001 to FY2008, impacting satellite-based observations and other research areas. External evaluations suggest improvements in leadership, budget coherence, progress metrics, reporting, and balance among research elements. The federal investment in the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has more than doubled since FY2001, reaching $4.30 billion enacted for FY2008. Funding supports nuclear energy research and development, a key component of climate change-related programs. Congressional consideration of legislative options may clarify goals, progress measures, and organization of federal climate change scientific research. Performance objectives for technology and regulatory programs could be set through new legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for nuclear energy research and development is a significant component of the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP). Stakeholders agree on the importance of advancing low-emitting technologies, but there is a need for greater continuity of programs and incentives. No rigorous evaluations of the CCTP have been conducted, but there are opportunities to support exploratory and revolutionary technologies. The program aims to improve efficiencies in federal stimulation of technological advance. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) aggregates existing climate-related technology programs to improve federal stimulation of technological advance. Federal funds and tax incentives support technologies that may worsen greenhouse gas emissions, so evaluating them together could lead to efficiencies. Climate change funding includes international programs, with a proposed increase of $2 billion over five years. Negotiating international commitments post-2012 and gaining global engagement in greenhouse gas mitigation are major challenges. Developing countries seek support for addressing climate change. The challenge post-2012 is negotiating international commitments to address climate change, with developing countries linking their participation to industrialized countries fulfilling their commitments. The United States, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change. Many believe that the US and other wealthy nations should take the lead in addressing climate change due to their resources and standard of living. In 1992, the United States committed, along with other wealthy countries, to addressing climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention. The United States committed in 1992, along with other wealthy countries, to provide financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to address climate change. The US has contributed to the Global Environmental Facility but not to special funds for the least developed countries. The US Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund in 2008, with concerns about promoting coal use. Other countries pledged funds for the Climate Investment Funds of the World Bank. The U.S. commitment to provide financial and technological assistance for climate change mitigation has not been appropriated by Congress. Concerns exist about the Clean Technology Fund promoting coal use. Countries also seek technological cooperation with the U.S. Federal programs and private partnerships will determine the U.S.'s role as a leader, collaborator, or follower in the future. The degree of funding appropriated by Congress will influence the Department of State's ability to enhance U.S. credibility and engage developing countries in new GHG mitigation commitments. Providing assistance alone may not guarantee developing countries' acceptance of it as measurable, reportable, and verifiable finance, technology, and capacity-building. The Bali Action Plan of 2007 addresses financial assistance outside of UNFCCC mechanisms, controversy over managing multilateral funds, conditions on financing, and the need for \"new and additional\" funds. Tax provisions aim to stimulate low GHG technologies, but continuity issues may hinder long-term planning for renewable energy projects. Delays in renewing incentives for renewable energy investments in 2008 may have impacted new facility development. The delay in renewing incentives for renewable energy investments in 2008 may have reduced their effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions due to uncertainties and reduced investor confidence. Tax credits may not be as effective in the current economic situation, and controversies exist over the efficiency of tax incentives in achieving policy goals. Tax incentives for low and high GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the true cost of energy to consumers. Executive Branch reporting on climate change expenditures only includes tax incentives that stimulate GHG reductions. The Obama Administration is expected to provide more action-oriented leadership in understanding and aligning climate-related programs and funding across agencies to address climate change effectively. Funding for climate change activities has largely reflected departmental missions and stakeholder priorities, lacking a unifying mission. Tax provisions supporting various policy objectives may counteract incentives for greenhouse gas reductions, highlighting the need for revising counter-acting tax provisions to achieve overall efficiencies. The Obama Administration aims to provide more action-oriented leadership in aligning climate-related programs and funding across agencies. There are gaps in governance infrastructure and funding for climate change programs, with stakeholders arguing for more resources for assessing impacts and adaptation planning. Multiple agencies manage programs addressing similar issues like carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas development. Several agencies manage programs addressing issues such as carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. Constraints on funding, administrative requirements, and barriers to job mobility hinder efficiency and effectiveness. Expertise of federal officials and federal policies play a crucial role in program success. Funding challenges for interagency teams are reported. Funding challenges for interagency teams hinder development, interaction, and collaboration. Critics argue that structural fixes are needed in federal programs to address weaknesses. Proposals to restructure and expand climate change programs may be debated in the 111th Congress. Members of Congress are interested in how federal funding can support an overall strategy to address climate change. Calls to expand funding may face challenges in demonstrating program benefits. Calls to expand funding for climate change programs may face challenges in demonstrating program benefits due to budget pressures. The new President's pledges and evolving Congressional debate may lead to changes in priorities for climate change activities. Improved reporting of funding and better alignment with strategic policy goals are recommended. The Congress did not include statutory language in the FY2008 appropriations law or in the FY2009 Continuing Resolution requiring the Administration to report to Congress on federal expenditures for climate change activities, unlike in previous years. The FY2008 and FY2009 appropriations laws did not include statutory language requiring the Administration to report on federal expenditures for climate change activities, unlike previous years. However, reporting requirements were included in previous laws such as P.L. 110-5 for FY2007 and P.L. 109-102 for FY2006. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006, requires the President to report to Congress on climate change expenditures within 60 days of submitting the budget. This includes detailing federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs in fiscal year 2006, as well as estimated expenditures for fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007 by the United States Agency for International Development. The United States Agency for International Development requested funds for various clean energy and climate change programs by country and central program. President George W. Bush aimed to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and focused on reducing uncertainties, promoting energy-efficient technologies, and improving measurement standards. President George W. Bush announced a national goal to halt increases in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, with a focus on regulatory measures and market incentives to promote clean technologies. The plan would only be included in an international agreement if other major emitting economies also participated. Some stakeholders criticized the new policy. President Bush's 2002 strategy established a new Cabinet-level Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration to oversee science and technology research programs across agencies. The strategy puts accountability and leadership for the programs in each relevant agency, leading to criticism about collaboration and accountability. Communication and coordination are facilitated through inter-agency working groups. Budget levels are established through dialogue between agencies. Under the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) announced in 2002, President Bush set up a Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) that supplements the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US GCRP). The strategy also established a Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) parallel to the science research program, including a National Climate Change Technology Initiative (NCCTI) and clean energy research. The Department of State leads international cooperation efforts. The appendix describes climate change science activities funded by agencies under the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). NASA's FY2008 funding for CCSP was $1.20 billion, with a proposed increase of $125.6 million for FY2009. NASA's share of CCSP funding remains at approximately 58%. $666 million of NASA's FY2008 funding was allocated for satellite observations. NASA's FY2008 funding for CCSP was $1.20 billion, with $666 million allocated for satellite observations. President Bush proposed a $125.6 million increase for FY2009, with $102.3 million intended for satellite-based observations. This would have increased the satellite share to $769 million (64% of NASA's total). Key climate-related data continuity would be ensured by restoring the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and placing the Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) on the NPOESS Preparatory Project. These sensors would help determine solar variability's impact on climate and how atmospheric changes influence the Earth's energy balance. NASA's Earth Sciences programs faced budget cuts in 2006, impacting climate change research. A 2006 NRC report criticized the lack of balance in NASA's space and Earth science program, stating it was not sustainable or capable of making adequate progress. The FY2009 proposal included a 22% funding decrease for the Earth System Science Pathfinder, affecting missions like the Orbiting Carbon Observatory and Aquarius. NASA's budget projection aimed to allocate $910 million for developing priorities like the SMAP mission. NASA's FY2009 budget projection includes a 22% funding decrease for Earth Sciences programs, impacting missions like the Orbiting Carbon Observatory and Aquarius. The budget aims to allocate $910 million for developing priorities such as the SMAP mission and a second generation ICESat mission for ice topography measurement. NASA has revised its accounting methods since 2005, making budget authority comparison difficult across multiple years. Several satellite systems, including Landsat Data Continuity Mission and GRACE, were newly included in the FY2006 request. NASA's FY2009 budget includes funding for satellite-based climate-related observations, with contributions from agencies like NOAA, Department of Defense, and USGS. NASA's Earth Science account also supports Applied Sciences and Education and Outreach to bridge missions with potential users for societal benefits. The budget aims to evaluate policy, market, and technology approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as its impact on infectious diseases. Funding for satellite-based observations has declined in recent years, but support for other observations remains. Despite declining funds for satellite-based observations, other observation funding and research have decreased even faster. Recommendations have been made to correct the reduction in research and analysis programs at NASA. Users of NASA data require better access to data rather than new tools. It is unclear if there will be a change in effort in the FY2009 budget for applied research at NASA related to climate change adaptation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plays a significant role in the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), with funding constituting about 14% of the total. NOAA's budget for climate change science was proposed to increase by $20 million in FY2009, primarily for observational capacities rather than applied research or planning. This proposed increase does not reflect a significant emphasis on the impacts of climate change or adaptation science within NOAA. The FY2009 proposal for NOAA includes a $74 million increase for developing key satellite climate sensors, such as the CERES and TSIS sensors. These sensors aim to measure Earth's radiation and solar variations to distinguish the solar influence from other factors driving climate change. The funding redistribution within NOAA is on hold until March 6, 2009, due to the Continuing Resolution. The FY2009 budget proposal for NOAA includes a $74 million increase for developing key satellite climate sensors, such as CERES and TSIS, to assure overlapping data series for calibration of measurements. This increase is in response to Decadal Survey recommendations and aims to provide a more accurate picture of climate funding. The Administration's budget request for the CCSP includes funding for these items, which would raise NOAA's budget authority significantly compared to previous accounting methods. Proposed reductions include cutting funding for Regional Climate Centers and Archive, Access, and Assessment. NOAA's objectives for FY2009 include developing an integrated earth system analysis capability and creating a high-quality record of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979. The budget justification for FY2009 includes objectives such as developing an integrated earth system analysis capability, creating a high-quality record of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979, enhancing carbon cycle research, quantifying climate forcing and feedbacks, assessing abrupt climate change, and ecological forecasting. Specific funding proposals were not detailed, but there are increases in funding for Climate Data and Information and research on Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The FY2009 budget proposal includes increased funding for Climate Data and Information, National Integrated Drought Information System, and Water Vapor Process Research. It also proposes the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA to improve climate forecasts and data products. The proposed Climate Information Services aim to improve seasonal to multi-annual forecasts and drought information for better prediction and response to disasters. The National Climate Service focuses on shorter-term climate variability, not long-term climate change debates. The FY2009 budget includes increased funding for climate data, drought information, and the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA. The National Science Foundation's funding for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) was proposed to increase by $16 million to $220.6 million in FY2009. This would constitute about 11% of the CCSP budget, with two components receiving significant increases in funding. The National Science Foundation proposed a funding increase for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program in FY2009, with significant increases for Geosciences and the Office of Polar Programs. NSF's climate change science programs focus on fundamental discovery, research infrastructure, and educational activities. Additionally, the Department of Energy's funding for the CCSP was proposed to increase by $17.6 million in FY2009. The CCSP funding was proposed to increase by $17.6 million in FY2009 to $145.9 million. The largest component supports research on \"climate forcing,\" with $81.2 million allocated in FY2009. This includes funding for Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) to study clouds, aerosols, and solar radiation interactions. Additional funding would support research on atmospheric aerosols, Ameriflux for measuring carbon dioxide exchanges, and expanding ARM facilities. In FY2009, funding for AmeriFlux, supported by various organizations including NASA and NOAA, would continue to measure carbon dioxide, energy, and water exchanges in North America. The Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC) would receive $1.9 million. The DOE's Office of Science proposed $45.4 million for climate change modeling, with $7.8 million for an Earth System model and $2.6 million for abrupt climate change research. The Climate Change Response program would receive $19.4 million for experimental studies on ecosystem effects of warming, precipitation changes, and CO2 increases. In FY2009, research funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in the Office of Biological Research increased to $17.4 million. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) allocated $31.4 million for CCSP-related work, with $26.6 million consolidated into one Global Change activity account. Additionally, $3.7 million supported the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA) and $1.1 million contributed to the CCSP in the Biological Research and Monitoring activity. USGS is implementing a new climate change science strategy called the National Climate Effects Research and Monitoring Network. This network includes long-term monitoring in \"focus areas\" to study key processes related to climate change, field study sites to assess sensitivity to climate change, regional and national surveys, and increased use of space-based remote sensing. They also plan to develop decision tools for resource managers and policy makers to address future climate change. The FY2009 budget request aimed to eliminate $2.5 million in funding for geologic carbon sequestration research. The FY2009 budget request aimed to eliminate $2.5 million in funding for geologic carbon sequestration research. The Bureau of Reclamation is involved in climate change-related activities, focusing on water and power operations, collaborative research, and obtaining relevant climate information. Their budget justification requested $31.9 million for climate change activities. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $31.9 million for climate change activities, with $19.0 million allocated to the Water for America Initiative. An additional $12.9 million would fund projects for endangered species recovery and investigation programs. Reclamation's efforts focus on planning for the nation's water future and conserving water resources. The Department of Health and Human Services received $46.8 million for climate change science related to health effects of ultra-violet radiation from stratospheric ozone depletion. The Department of Health and Human Services received $46.8 million for climate change science related to health effects of ultra-violet radiation from stratospheric ozone depletion. The Centers for Disease Control is engaged in work on climate change impacts on infectious diseases, allergens, and preparedness, with a focus on understanding the potential health effects of global climate change. The CDC has identified 11 priority health actions and developed a policy statement in response to the need for additional scientific research in this area. In October 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) released research priorities to address health effects of climate change globally, focusing on interactions with other health determinants, long-term climate change effects, effectiveness of interventions, and assessing health impact of non-health sector policies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contributes to the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) by researching air and water quality effects of climate change on human health and ecosystems. The EPA's research on climate change impacts has faced funding reductions, with a proposed $2.8 million cut in FY2009 from the previous year's $19.6 million budget. Despite declining funding, the agency's Science Advisory Board highlighted the importance of EPA's research in understanding climate change risks and warned of potential future costs due to inadequate research funding. The EPA's research on climate change impacts has faced funding reductions, with a proposed $2.8 million cut in FY2009 from the previous year's $19.6 million budget. The Science Advisory Board recommended that EPA adopt long-term GHG reduction objectives to better define their research portfolio. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's funding for climate change science in FY2008 was $64.4 million, but the FY2009 request would have reduced this amount to $60.3 million, with most cuts coming from various climate change programs in the Agricultural Research Service. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) faced cuts to climate change programs in FY2009, with a request of $35.7 million. Research includes activities like GRACEnet and Agriflux to understand soil carbon sequestration. Funding for Forest Services related to climate change would be reduced by $2.2 million. The Economic Research Service's climate change research funding would remain at $50 thousand. Funding for CSREES would increase by $1.7 million. In FY2009, funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) would increase by $1.7 million to $5.7 million. CSREES provided grants for research on land use, land cover, and managed ecosystems related to carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes. Funding for research on ultraviolet radiation effects on plant and animal physiology and ecosystems would increase by $0.8 million, and on the carbon cycle by $1.1 million. The FY2009 request proposed $0.5 million for the National Research Initiative (NRI). The FY2009 funding levels for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) are reported, with President Bush's request outlined. The Department of Energy (DOE) is the largest component of the CCTP, with proposed changes including reductions in energy efficiency and renewable energy funding, and increases in geothermal systems, biofuels, and vehicle technologies. The FY2009 funding levels for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) are reported, with proposed reductions for energy supply and conservation, and increases for geothermal systems, biofuels, and vehicle technologies. There are significant increases in funding for Fossil Energy Research and Development/Efficiency, nuclear energy supply and conservation, and nuclear fusion research. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2008 covering most of the CCTP appropriations, with deviations from the FY2008 levels and the FY2009 request. The FY2009 funding levels for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) show proposed reductions for energy supply and conservation, and increases for geothermal systems, biofuels, and vehicle technologies. Both chambers rejected the elimination of DOE weatherization grants and added $250 million for weatherization in the Continuing Resolution. Funding for nuclear energy has increased significantly, making it a large share of CCTP funding. The focus of the clean coal program has shifted towards improving efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for nuclear energy R&D program is intended to develop new technologies. The FY2009 budget proposes significant increases in funding for nuclear energy R&D, making it a major part of the Climate Change Technology Program. The program aims to develop new nuclear energy generation technologies to meet energy and climate goals. However, critics argue that the nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out due to safety and economic concerns. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel to expand nuclear power while reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. In 2008, the House Appropriations Committee criticized the rushed and expensive Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) program, eliminating its funding. However, funding for advanced nuclear reactors was increased. President Obama supported harnessing nuclear energy to address climate change. The US Department of Agriculture contributed to the Climate Change Technology Program with both mandatory and discretionary funding, with FY2008 funding levels estimated at $205 million. President Bush's FY2008 Farm Bill proposed a significant increase in CCTP funding from $14 million to $151 million. The FY2009 budget included a $22 million decrease in CCTP funding, primarily from the renewable energy program. The increases in FY2008 were due to mandatory funding for various farm programs, including bioenergy research and renewable energy grants and loans. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized, modified, and expanded programs in Conservation, Energy, and Rural Development titles. USDA programs indirectly affect U.S. climate change initiatives, but the impact on overall funding levels for climate change programs is uncertain. DOD funding for CCTP rose from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million in FY2008, with a proposed increase to $131.0 million in President Bush's budget. DOD appropriations for FY2009 were passed into law and signed on September 30, 2008 (P.L. 110 - 329). The Administration requested to raise Air Force funding for the CCTP by $81.7 million from FY2008 to a total of $103 million FY2009, while decreasing funding to the Army and Navy for FY2009. The DOD would have incentives to engage in advanced, low-greenhouse gas technologies, given its significant fuel consumption and expenses. In 2005, the DOD accounted for 97% of all U.S. Government fuel consumption, costing over $8 billion. The Defense Science Board warned in 2008 that the DOD's energy consumption patterns put military operations at risk due to high fuel demand and dependence on a fragile electricity grid. The DOD had not implemented key recommendations from a 2001 task force on energy, and leadership oversight is needed to address the energy problem effectively. The 2008 report recommended establishing oversight and accountability for implementing energy recommendations across the DoD, including a strategic plan with measurable goals. Decisions on alternative fuels could impact greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 placed constraints on agencies procuring alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil fuels. The Defense Science Board recommended that the Department of Defense invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies to address unique needs, avoiding processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum. The Defense Science Board recommended that the Department of Defense invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies to address unique needs, avoiding processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum. DARPA has been praised for its contributions to technological advance and some experts suggest expanding its mission to advance energy technologies for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for DARPA-E was proposed to be eliminated in FY2009, with Congress amending Section 118 of title 10 to require DOD to consider the effects of alternative fuels. In 2008, the 110th Congress amended Section 118 of title 10, United States Code, requiring the Department of Defense (DOD) to consider the effects of climate change on its facilities, capabilities, and missions. The law mandates that military planners assess risks of climate change, update defense plans, engage with allies on mitigation strategies, and develop capabilities to reduce future impacts. The next quadrennial defense review must assess DOD's capacities to respond to climate change consequences, using mid-range scenarios of future climate change. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a plan to Congress to improve DOD's participation in interagency coordination on national security. The law amended in 2008 requires the Department of Defense to consider climate change effects on its operations. The Secretary of Defense must submit a plan to Congress for better interagency coordination on national security. The Environmental Protection Agency's funding for climate change programs is decreasing. EPA's role includes evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and providing assistance to reduce them. Funding will continue at FY2008 levels until March 6, 2009. President Bush's proposal would reduce EPA's funding for greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, including Energy Star and transportation activities, by millions of dollars. The budget cuts would also eliminate funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry. EPA plays a key role in evaluating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The FY2008 omnibus appropriations directed EPA to develop a rule for mandatory reporting of emissions above certain thresholds in all sectors of the economy. President Bush's FY2009 proposal did not continue funding for the national Greenhouse Gas Registry, causing backlash. Consistent GHG reporting is crucial for effective emission control programs. Other initiatives are also working on guidance for reporting GHG emissions. The EPA is working on developing guidance for reporting greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions in case of mandatory requirements. The FY2009 budget justification mentions other initiatives for efficiency and integration. Funding for the Asia-Pacific Partnership was denied in previous years. The EPA's appropriations do not reflect current climate technology initiatives, and changes may occur with the next administration's proposals. The next Administration's proposals may include significant changes in activity levels and descriptions for NASA's share of CCTP funding, which was proposed to decline from 3.2% to 2.6%. The largest portion of NASA's CCTP funding is for the Fundamental Aeronautics Program aimed at developing high-performance aircraft and rotorcraft to reduce emissions. The FY2009 request would have reduced the level by $19.5 million to $100.5 million, with a provision requiring NASA to support research and development of environmentally friendly aircraft. President Bush's request would have reduced Exploration Technology Development. President Bush's request aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by cutting funding for Exploration Technology Development Program projects in FY2009. The Climate Change Technology Priorities identified by the Bush Administration included high-priority technologies, but their current funding status is unclear."
