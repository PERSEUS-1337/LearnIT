    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This leads to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, with millions of Americans getting sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters. The economic impact of swimming-related illnesses is significant, with annual losses estimated at billions of dollars. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring for early detection. Economic losses from swimming-related illnesses amount to $28 billion annually. Sewer systems often lack monitoring and reporting of overflows, putting millions at risk of illness. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows threatening public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act defines \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as the release of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by building blockages. Monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are required. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342) now includes requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify public health authorities and water systems of sanitary sewer overflows that endanger human health. Reports must be provided within 24 hours orally or electronically and within 5 days in writing detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause, along with steps taken to address and prevent recurrence. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or the State, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses to clean up, and actions taken to mitigate the impact. The State must report annually to the EPA on sanitary sewer overflows that occurred, including details of the impacts, clean-up responses, and mitigation actions taken. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends section 603(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAmends section 607 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize $2,200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008."
