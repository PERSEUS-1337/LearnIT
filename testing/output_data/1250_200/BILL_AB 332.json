    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that Californians are concerned about the costs of long-term care, with many unable to afford nursing home care. A task force will be established to explore creating a statewide insurance program for long-term care services. A Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is created in the Department of Insurance to design and implement a statewide long-term care insurance program. The task force consists of nine members, including the commissioner, health care and aging directors, appointed experts, and representatives from various organizations related to long-term care. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force, appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, explores designing a statewide long-term care insurance program to expand options for insuring against disability costs. The task force considers eligibility, benefits, financing, and interaction with Medi-Cal and other resources. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is exploring the inclusion of a long-term care insurance program in the state disability insurance structure. This program would provide basic insurance benefits to working adults with cognitive limitations, help individuals stay in their communities, and offset costs for those with chronic conditions. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is evaluating a program to help adults with chronic conditions by offsetting costs. They are also considering coordinating benefits with existing private health care coverage, addressing the demands on the long-term care workforce, and establishing a joint public and private system for accessibility. Recommendations will be made for regulatory provisions and budgetary resources will be utilized for implementation. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will recommend options for a statewide long-term care insurance program by July 1, 2017. An actuarial report on the recommendations must be produced by July 1, 2018. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementation. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
