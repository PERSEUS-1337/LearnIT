The Act \"America's Border Security Act of 2007\" mandates increased use of Department of Defense equipment like unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance at US borders to prevent illegal immigration. A report assessing risks and current equipment use must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. The Act mandates increased use of Department of Defense equipment for border surveillance, including a pilot program for unmanned aerial vehicles along the US-Canada border. No alteration to the prohibition on using Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus is allowed. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary of Homeland Security for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to carry out border surveillance activities. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to construct all-weather roads, acquire vehicle barriers, and facilities for border control. Quarterly progress reports to Congress are required. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Additionally, the Secretary can construct new ports of entry and improve existing ones.
