    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of access to credit spread globally, leading the Federal Reserve to establish a target range of 0% to 0.25% in response to the crisis. The Federal Reserve acknowledged the severity of the crisis by acting under \"unusual and exigent circumstances\". The Federal Reserve has acted under \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" multiple times since the financial crisis began. This includes providing assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959 and purchasing debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises for the first time since 1981. Additionally, joint programs were established with the Department of the Treasury during the crisis. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve established joint programs with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets, guaranteeing assets of Citigroup and Bank of America. Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasized transparency in lending programs to Congress and the public in 2009. SEC. 3. REVIEWS OF SPECIAL FEDERAL RESERVE CREDIT FACILITIES. Section 714 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to allow the Comptroller General to conduct reviews of credit facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any Federal reserve bank, including onsite examinations when deemed necessary. This includes actions approved by the Board under the Federal Reserve Act as the lender of last resort or providing temporary assistance to private institutions. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 allows the Comptroller General to review credit facilities established by the Federal Reserve, including various specific facilities such as the Money Market Investor Funding Facility and the Term Auction Facility. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 authorizes the Comptroller General to review specific credit facilities established by the Federal Reserve, including Maiden Lane, LLC, Maiden Lane II, LLC, Maiden Lane III, LLC, the Revolving Credit Facility, reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks, Mortgage Backed Securities Purchase Program, and special purpose vehicles. The authority granted by this Act expires after a 5-year period, and a report on each review must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of completion. The report must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of completing the review, including detailed findings, conclusions, and recommendations for legislative or administrative action by the Comptroller General. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO RECORDS. Amends Section 714(d)(1) and Section 714(d)(2) of title 31, United States Code, granting the Comptroller General access to records of agencies and credit facilities, allowing for copies to be made as deemed appropriate."
