    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options include increasing funding and changing how ships are funded in the budget. Options for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing funding, changing funding methods, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, building ships without certain equipment, and considering foreign shipyards for construction. Another option is to shift to designs with lower unit procurement costs if other options are insufficient. This report focuses on the latter option. The report discusses options for lower-cost Navy ship designs, including attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. Various reports have proposed these designs, suggesting changes like reducing ship size to lower procurement costs. The Navy is exploring cost-saving strategies for ship designs, such as reducing ship size, shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, and using commercial-ship survivability standards to lower procurement costs. These changes are being considered for various types of Navy ships, including submarines and aircraft carriers. The Navy is considering cost-saving strategies for ship designs, including using commercial-like hulls for ships like the Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) squadron. Common hull designs for multiple ship classes can reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. The Navy plans to use the hull design for the DDG-1000 destroyer as the hull for the CG(X) cruiser. Reports suggest building large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull and using the LPD-17 class amphibious ship design for other ships. The Navy is exploring cost-saving strategies for ship designs, including using common hull designs for multiple ship classes. Lower-cost ship options derived from current designs are discussed, with potential advantages and disadvantages outlined. For example, the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine could have reduced-cost options like AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines or \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy currently procures one Virginia-class submarine per year at a cost of about $2.6 billion each. The Navy is considering cost-saving strategies for ship designs, including the procurement of one Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) per year at a cost of $2.6 billion. To maintain a fleet of 48 SSNs, the Navy may need to procure 35 boats between FY2007-FY2022. Options for lower-cost submarines include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines or \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report proposed the procurement of air-independent propulsion (AIP)-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines as a cost-saving strategy. AIP submarines could be acquired alongside Virginia-class boats, with the possibility of substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group. This could result in acquiring four AIP submarines for the same cost as one Virginia-class submarine. The Office of Force Transformation proposed acquiring air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines alongside Virginia-class boats to save costs. It was suggested that four AIP submarines could be procured for the same cost as one Virginia-class submarine. The potential average unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine is estimated to be around $600 million to $750 million. The development of new technologies may allow for the design of a new, less expensive SSN equivalent in capability to the Virginia class. The Navy and DARPA are working on these technologies under the Tango Bravo program. The Navy and DARPA are collaborating on the Tango Bravo program to develop technologies for a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the VIRGINIA Class design. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, while increasing payload volume. The program aims to overcome technology barriers in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal array alternatives, simplifying submarine systems, and automation for reducing crew workload. In 2004, Navy and industry officials discussed developing new submarine technologies to simplify systems and reduce crew workload, potentially creating a submarine equivalent to the Virginia class at 75% of the cost. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN with similar capabilities as the Virginia class has been considered as an alternative to procuring AIP submarines. Virginia-class procurement could continue until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement, at which point Virginia-class procurement would end. The Navy is considering the design and procurement of a new Tango Bravo submarine as a potential lower-cost option compared to large nuclear-powered carriers. The current design options include a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier and a small carrier based on high-speed surface effect ship design. The Navy is currently building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is scheduled to be procured in FY2008. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, in FY2008 as part of the CVN-21 class. The estimated procurement cost is $10.5 billion, with plans for CVN-78 to enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012 and CVN-80 in FY2016. Lower-cost options include a medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on the LHA-6 design. The Navy is considering different options for future aircraft carriers, including a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA-6 design and a small, high-speed carrier on a surface effect ship hull. Recommendations include procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and additional medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. The cost of the medium-sized carrier is estimated at $3 billion with a displacement of 40,000 tons. Another recommendation is a carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons based on a commercial-like hull design. The Navy is considering different options for future aircraft carriers, including a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA-6 design and a small, high-speed carrier on a surface effect ship hull. Recommendations include procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and additional medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. The cost of the medium-sized carrier is estimated at $3 billion with a displacement of 40,000 tons. Another recommendation is a carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons based on a commercial-like hull design for the Navy's Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), or MPF(F), analysis of alternatives. This carrier would embark a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles. The OFT report recommended substituting two of these 57,000-ton carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. Alternatively, the report recommended procuring a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons that would use a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull. The OFT report recommended developing a high-speed unmanned aerial vehicle carrier with a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs. The ship would have a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots and be slightly larger than Thailand's aircraft carrier. It would be much faster than existing carriers and could potentially replace the Navy's current large carriers. Other potential designs discussed include a large conventionally powered carrier. A large conventionally powered carrier design is being considered, with a potential displacement of 100,000 tons and a cost lower than the CVN-78. Another option is a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull, costing more than $3 billion and similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs. Ship size, propulsion type, and hull type create a matrix of aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, while small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has procured nuclear-powered cruisers in the past, but combining a nuclear propulsion plant with a commercial-like hull for a combat ship like an aircraft carrier may be seen as contradictory. Current designs include the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options like an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers based on the DDG-1000 design. The Navy plans to procure a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)) and DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers. The DDG-1000 would be larger and more expensive than current Aegis cruisers and destroyers, with estimated costs of $3.3 billion each for the first two ships. Concerns exist about potential higher procurement costs than Navy estimates. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) believes DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, along with 19 CG(X)s. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, smaller than the DDG-1000 design. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could potentially replace the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate advanced technologies, have reduced procurement costs, and operate with a smaller crew compared to current designs. The SCD would have a smaller payload than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. It could be configured for land-attack with Advanced Gun Systems or for air and missile defense with CG(X) radar capabilities. A smaller, less expensive new-design ship called the FFG(X) has been suggested as an alternative to the DDG-1000/CG(X) effort and the LCS program. The FFG(X) could displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of around $800 million. It may not be equipped with the Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) but could perform non-gunfire missions similar to the DDG-1000 and LCS. The FFG(X) could serve as a replacement for the Navy's Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates and Spruance class destroyers. The Navy is considering a 6,000-ton FFG(X) as a potential replacement for the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates and Spruance class destroyers. Another option is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio amphibious ship, with an estimated cost of $1.9 billion for the initial ship. Additionally, there are potential lower-cost options for a 1,000-ton surface combatant and a 100-ton surface combatant. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The LCSs are small, fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The Navy aims for a procurement cost of no more than $220 million per LCS sea frame. The total acquisition cost for 55 LCSs is estimated to be around $22.1 billion. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant as an alternative to the LCS. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant or a 100-ton surface combatant with high speeds and modular mission packages. These ships would be supported in theater by larger ships and transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a commercial-like hull. The potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The potential ship designs outlined in the previous section would have lower unit procurement costs than currently planned designs. However, stopping a currently planned ship program in favor of a new, lower-cost design could incur substantial additional development and design costs. This decision might save money in the long run only if the lower-cost design is procured in large enough numbers to outweigh the additional upfront costs. The potential cost savings of switching to a lower-cost ship design may outweigh the additional upfront development and design costs. Building more ships to a specific design reduces labor hours and costs through the learning curve process. This means that if a lower-cost alternative design is adopted after some ships have already been built to the current design, the cost difference may be less, and the break-even point for the new design will be further into the production run. The lower-cost ship design could benefit from greater spreading of fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly, potentially reducing life-cycle operating and support costs for Navy ships. Reducing a ship's life-cycle operating and support (O&S) costs can involve design features that increase procurement costs, such as automating functions to reduce crew size. Maintenance costs may also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing space for easier access. Alternative ship designs with lower procurement costs may incorporate features that lower overall long-term Navy expenditures. The life-cycle O&S cost of a ship includes fuel costs, with nuclear-powered ships having the fuel core included in procurement cost. Nuclear-powered ships are more expensive to procure but have lower long-term fuel costs compared to conventionally powered ships. The higher initial cost of procuring a nuclear-powered submarine or carrier is offset by the absence of fuel-related operating costs over its lifetime. This cost advantage becomes more significant with rising oil prices, making nuclear power a more cost-effective option in the long run. The higher initial cost of procuring a nuclear-powered ship is offset by the absence of fuel-related operating costs over its lifetime. Higher oil costs in the future could make nuclear power more cost-effective for powering ships. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to transport the reactor compartment to a storage area. Lower-cost ship designs may be less capable than higher-cost counterparts. The reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN, under the Navy-DARPA Tango Bravo program, may be as capable as the Virginia-class design. Ship capability factors include payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and value in naval operations. Smaller Navy combat ships have decreased payload, making them proportionately less capable than larger ships due to factors like propulsion efficiency. Propulsion efficiency increases as ship size increases, allowing for more payload capacity. A smaller carrier can carry fewer aircraft compared to a larger carrier, but transferring the air wing to a larger carrier can result in more sorties per day due to its larger flight deck and fuel capacity. Reducing ship size can limit equipment capabilities and increase costs. Smaller carriers may not support certain aircraft, while smaller surface combatants may lack essential systems. Decreasing ship size can raise total procurement and operation costs if payload and crew/fuel efficiency do not decrease proportionately. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload fraction for recommended combatants. Precision-guidance technology allows for smaller weapons with same damage potential. Reduction in sensor weight and volume could also enhance ship capabilities. Larger ships can be designed to be as stealthy as smaller ones. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them as stealthy as smaller ships and better able to withstand hits. On the other hand, advocates for smaller ships believe that overwhelming the enemy with a large number of targets can be more effective and cost-efficient. Supporters of smaller ships argue that overwhelming the enemy with a large number of targets can be more effective and cost-efficient. They believe that fleet survivability is more important than individual-ship survivability, and a fleet of smaller ships can have superior overall survivability. Additionally, equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes its mobility and operational capabilities significantly. AIP systems like fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engines can extend the submerged endurance of non-nuclear-powered submarines, allowing them to operate below the surface for up to two or three weeks. However, high-speed submerged endurance remains limited to 1 to 3 hours for non-nuclear-powered submarines, whether equipped with conventional diesel-electric propulsion or AIP systems. The high-speed submerged endurance of submarines, whether equipped with conventional diesel-electric propulsion or AIP systems, is limited by battery capacity. Nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months due to food supply. Non-nuclear submarines are not suitable for long stealthy transits or extended submerged periods at high speeds. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship to the overseas theater of operations. This allows for the potential of U.S. AIP submarines to operate in multiple theaters simultaneously without alerting opposing forces. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine depends on the operations it needs to perform in conflict situations. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in conflict situations depends on the operations it needs to perform. Nuclear-powered carriers can respond quickly to crises without refueling, allowing for immediate combat operations upon arrival. Higher-speed ships like the LCS can sustain combat operations for longer periods before needing resupply. Advocates of a fleet with a larger number of ships argue that lower-cost ship designs could enable more ships to be deployed, increasing the fleet's presence in multiple locations and enhancing its ability to respond to various crises efficiently. This approach offers flexibility in deploying naval capability as needed, without incurring high daily operating costs. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships enhances the force's capability through network-centric warfare. On the other hand, defenders of a smaller fleet of more expensive ships emphasize the importance of ship capability over quantity for fulfilling required missions effectively. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that the Navy has increased deployment readiness to compensate for a limited number of ships. They believe current ship designs offer flexibility for forming naval formations with sufficient capability. Despite potential technical risks, lower-cost options like AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and high-speed carriers could still provide adequate nodes for network-centric warfare. The homeporting of Navy ships, especially nuclear-powered ones, can be complex due to unique requirements. Forward-homeporting in foreign countries can be challenging, especially with anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs may impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the volume or distribution of Navy shipbuilding work. Shifting to lower-cost ship designs may impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work depending on funding availability. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leading to no substantial change in shipbuilding work, using lower-cost designs to reduce total shipbuilding costs, or making Navy ships more cost-effective to potentially increase funding for ship procurement. The lower-cost ship designs in the report could impact the distribution of shipbuilding work among various shipyards, including General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News. This could lead to a different division of work compared to the current arrangement for building submarines. If AIP submarines were procured instead of nuclear-powered submarines, it could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in merchant-like hulls. NGSS and GD/NASSCO have experience building merchant-like hulls. If conventionally powered carriers were procured instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and GD/BIW. Larger surface combatants like a 11,000-ton SCD or a 6,000-ton FFG(X) could also be built at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) or low-cost gunfire support ship could be built at NGSS, GD/BIW, Avondale, or NGNN. Smaller surface combatants like the LCS are built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, or Austal USA. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 limit procurement costs for CVN-21, LHA(R), and LPD-17 class ships. House Armed Services Committee report highlights rising costs in defense acquisition programs. The Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 highlights concerns about rising costs and lengthening production schedules in defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. This may result in an over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems, limiting the strategic depth of U.S. forces. The report also addresses affordability issues in the Navy's shipbuilding plan. The committee expressed concerns about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, noting unrealistic assumptions and the need for a significant increase in funds. This raises uncertainty about the future of naval shipbuilding amidst anticipated federal spending reductions. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan and the excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is also worried about the process used for establishing the Navy's ship cost estimates. The committee is concerned about the accuracy of Navy ship cost estimates and recommends revising the process to include all major known elements. They also highlight the importance of having confidence in cost estimates for current ship classes. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes and submit them for review. They also express concerns about the affordability of the DDG-1000 program. The committee expresses concerns about the affordability of the DD(X) program, stating that the original requirements may not be met due to budget constraints. They suggest reducing the requirements to procure a smaller, more affordable destroyer in greater numbers. The committee supports the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for future surface combatants. The budget request did not include funds for the maritime technology program, which the committee acknowledges as important for naval advancements. The committee supports the maritime technology program to reduce naval ship construction costs and improve efficiency. They encourage expanding efforts to all ship procurements and have created a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The committee recommends funding for a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to enhance productivity and cost effectiveness of shipyards. They also suggest allocating $120.0 million for the maritime technology program. The national shipbuilding research program is highlighted for its collaborative environment. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP) which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. They also recommend providing grants to U.S. shipyards for innovative design and production technologies to enhance the shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants and loan guarantees to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for long-lead components for aircraft carriers. Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urges the Navy and shipbuilder to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers. They emphasize the need for stable ship requirements, increased funding in the shipbuilding budget, and flexibility for funding large capital ships to reverse the trend of high costs and low shipbuilding rates. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urges the Navy and shipbuilder to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers. They recommend an increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement to achieve program savings through stable procurement plans and economic order quantity material procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review procurement strategies for the CVN-21 class and submit a report outlining advance procurement requirements for potential savings and escalation avoidance. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the Secretary's report. The report highlights cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with a procurement cost increase to $6.057 billion attributed to various factors. Despite management actions taken by the Navy, there are concerns that costs will exceed the baseline cap. The committee recommends increasing funding for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 to achieve program savings and avoid escalation. None of the funds for advance procurement can be obligated before 30 days following receipt of the Secretary's report. The Navy is projecting CVN-77 costs to exceed the baseline cap despite management actions. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide quarterly reports on the ship construction contract details to assess cost performance and improve affordability. The report highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels, emphasizing the importance of cost control through competition, commonality, and learning curves. The committee supports the Navy's approach to rapidly field the LCS program but expresses concerns about apparent cost growth and the rapid ramp-up in procurement. Management of program risk is crucial to ensure affordable, full mission capability of the LCS program. The affordability appeal of the LCS program is at risk due to cost growth and rapid procurement ramp-up. The Navy lacks a clear acquisition strategy, making it difficult to assess total program costs. A report is required by December 1, 2006, outlining the acquisition, competition, and cost containment strategies, as well as R&D and procurement costs for the LCS program. The report highlights the importance of assessing R&D and procurement costs for the LCS program, as well as the added life cycle costs for different LCS designs. It also emphasizes the positive impact of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) in reducing shipbuilding costs and recommends an increase in funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts. The committee recommends a $10.0 million increase in funding for NSRP-ASE to support efforts in developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain, exploring new markets for shipbuilders, and enhancing computer interoperability. Additionally, H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and establishes unit procurement cost caps for various naval vessels. Section 125 establishes a unit procurement cost cap for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, while Section 126 sets caps for LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Section 215 authorizes $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 directs a naval vessel construction efficiency assessment. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. The Secretary must report any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The conferees recognize uncertainties in completing the CVN-21 design and construction, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for risk reduction. Compliance may require trade-offs affecting capabilities, performance, safety, and crew quality of life. The conferees acknowledge the need for cost trade-offs in the design and construction of the CVN-21 class, with potential impacts on capabilities, performance, safety, and crew quality of life. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could compromise safety or program requirements. The amendment does not grant authority to adjust cost limitations for congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs in the annual notice to congressional defense committees regarding changes to cost limitations for the LHA-6 budget. The amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in program execution, with the expectation that the Navy will manage program execution within budget estimates. Compliance with this provision will require procurement cost trade-offs. The Navy will manage program execution within budget estimates, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that could impact various factors in the design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that would affect safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's long-term viability. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's long-term viability in shipbuilding due to lack of cost control and rising cost growth in ongoing ship construction contracts. They recommended reducing Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The Committee urged the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop cost control initiatives, and sign contracts that reduce the likelihood of cost growth. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Committee noted rising cost growth in ongoing ship construction contracts and required the Navy to submit a plan to address these issues. The Navy's report, submitted late, only summarized cost overruns in shipbuilding over the past two decades. The Committee is worried about the gap between the Navy's statements on cost controls and actual actions taken. Navy briefings highlighted cost overruns in programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines. The Navy estimates an $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap on the program. The fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth on the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), and cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy standards. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about rising cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs, particularly in ongoing ship construction contracts. The Committee is hesitant to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns without a detailed plan for cost control. The Navy's proposed FY2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth on the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), and cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy expectations. The Committee recommends a reduction of $141.4 million for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with allocations for various ship programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding to an average of roughly $14.4 billion per year. Another option is to modify the funding structure for new Navy ships, possibly using incremental funding or advance appropriations. These changes could help mitigate rising costs in Navy shipbuilding programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to modify the funding structure for new Navy ships, possibly using incremental funding or advance appropriations. Another option is to make greater use of multiyear procurement in Navy ship-procurement programs, which could marginally increase the number of ships procured for a given total amount of money. However, this could reduce flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in response to changing circumstances. Another option would be to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships. Changing the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as shifting to a single-yard approach, could potentially save $3 billion for building 10 DDG-1000 destroyers. However, this strategy may lead to the second yard exiting the business, leaving the Navy with a single source for that type of ship. This could limit competition, innovation, and quality control in future ship acquisitions. Another option is to increase competition in Navy ship procurement to drive down costs and improve efficiency. Employing competition in Navy ship acquisition involves awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. This approach requires a high annual procurement rate or the possibility of a yard permanently withdrawing from building that type of ship. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. To reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs in Navy ship procurement, excess capacity among yards building Navy ships can be eliminated. This can be achieved by increasing other forms of work at these yards, such as construction for other government agencies or commercial ships, and improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to enhance operating efficiency. The 2005 DOD report compares the operating efficiency of U.S. shipyards building Navy ships with foreign shipyards, making recommendations to improve efficiency. One option suggested is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment, which could reduce capabilities but add back costs later. This strategy may increase the total procurement cost of the ship in the long run. Building Navy ships in foreign shipyards may lower construction costs due to lower wages and material prices. However, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits constructing vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards, unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. This provision also exempts inflatable boats. Additionally, the annual DOD appropriations act allocates funds for Navy shipbuilding, with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The DOD appropriations act allocates funds for Navy shipbuilding, with a provision prohibiting the construction of naval vessels in foreign shipyards. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships and options for cost reduction."
