    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the United States. It allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with lower immigrant admissions over the past five years, aiming to stimulate new and varied migration. The program began in FY1995 and is administered by the USCIS based on regional populations. The diversity visa lottery allocates 55,000 visas annually based on regional populations, favoring under-represented regions. Each country is limited to 7% of the visa limit. Recipients become legal permanent residents of the United States. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries sending diversity visa immigrants were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. These countries have consistently ranked among the top diversity visa sending countries. Albania has been the top sending country followed by Nigeria. Russia and Ukraine's numbers may be understated due to nationals born in the Soviet Union.

Russia and Ukraine's numbers may be understated due to nationals born in the Soviet Union. Diversity visa recipients differ substantially from family-based and employment-based immigrants in terms of regions. European and African immigrants received a higher percentage of diversity visas compared to family-based and employment-based visas. Eligibility for a diversity visa requires a high school education or two years of experience in a qualifying occupation. The diversity visa lottery winners must have two years of training or experience and be native of a qualifying country. They undergo reviews to ensure eligibility for visas and admission, based on various exclusion criteria. The FY2005 lottery required electronic applications, with a 60-day submission period. For the FY2005 diversity visa lottery, applications had to be submitted electronically, with paper forms not accepted. Certain countries were ineligible for the lottery, and applicants had to follow State Department instructions precisely to avoid disqualification. Over 2 million applications were disqualified in FY2003 for not complying with instructions. Multiple applications from the same individual were grounds for disqualification, except for spouses who could submit separate entries. Winners of the FY2005 diversity visa lottery were selected randomly by computer after all acceptable applications were received. The State Department is expected to notify winners between May and July 2004, with visas issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Winning the lottery does not guarantee a visa, as more applications are drawn than visas available. Applicants must act quickly to provide necessary documentation to demonstrate eligibility. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery draws more applications than available visas. Winners must act quickly to file necessary documentation by September 30, 2005. Some question the lottery's continuation, suggesting visas be used for backlog reduction. Supporters argue it brings diversity to immigration dominated by a few countries. Critics propose amending the INA to exclude countries identified as sponsors of terrorism. Critics propose amending the INA to exclude countries identified as sponsors of terrorism from the diversity visa lottery. Supporters argue for uniform application of the policy, while the issue of who should bear the costs of operating the lottery has also been raised. The diversity visa has been criticized for being vulnerable to fraud and misuse, but the State Department is addressing these concerns."
