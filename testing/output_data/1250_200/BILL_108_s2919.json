This credit is aimed at supporting Indian tribal prison facilities. The new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a nonrefundable credit for holders of Indian Tribal Prison Facility Bonds to support Indian tribal prison facilities. Taxpayers holding these bonds on credit allowance dates can claim a credit against their tax liability based on the bond's face amount and the credit rate determined by the Secretary. The Secretary determines a credit rate for Indian tribal prison facility bonds issued each month to allow issuance without discount or interest cost. The credit allowed for a taxable year is limited by the taxpayer's regular tax liability and other credits. The credit amount is included in gross income as interest income. An Indian tribal prison facility bond is defined as an issue where 95% or more of the proceeds are used for such facilities. The term 'Indian tribal prison facility bond' refers to a bond issued by an Indian tribe for the construction, acquisition, or operation of a qualified tribal prison facility. The bond must meet specific criteria, including investment in investment-grade obligations, issuance by the tribe within the facility's jurisdiction, and a maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, no more than 2 percent of the bond proceeds can be used for issuance costs. The term 'qualified Indian tribal prison facility' refers to a residential correctional or detention facility on Indian tribal land where most inmates are tribal members. There is a yearly limit of $200,000,000 for Indian tribal prison facility bonds, allocated by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, allocates the Indian tribal prison facility bond limitation among tribes based on their proposed use of investment proceeds, assurance of proper use, expenditure schedule, and approval criteria including prison overcrowding percentage and facility conditions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs determines the issuance limitation for Indian tribal prison facility bonds based on existing facilities, health and safety concerns, type of offenders, and available financial resources. Any unused limitation amount can be carried over to future years. The credit allowance date is defined as the last day of the 1-year period after issuance of the bond. The term 'date' refers to the last day of the 1-year period after bond issuance and subsequent 1-year periods. 'Bond' includes any obligation. 'Indian tribe' and 'qualified Indian lands' have specific definitions. Rules similar to section 41(g) apply to partnerships, S corporations, and other pass-thru entities for the credit. If an Indian tribal prison facility bond is held by a regulated investment company, shareholders can claim the credit as per the Secretary's procedures. The credit on Indian tribal prison facility bonds can be claimed by shareholders of an investment company, following procedures set by the Secretary. Indian tribes with allocated bonds must submit reports similar to those required under section 149(e). Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include reporting requirements for interest payments on these bonds. The Internal Revenue Code includes reporting requirements for interest payments on Indian tribal prison facility bonds, with regulations allowing for more detailed reporting as needed. Additionally, holders of these bonds are subject to a special rule for estimated tax purposes under section 6654. The Internal Revenue Code includes a special rule for holders of Indian tribal prison facility bonds regarding the treatment of credits as estimated tax payments. This rule applies to both individual and corporate taxpayers. The Internal Revenue Code is amended by adding a new item to the table of subparts for part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subpart for Nonrefundable Credit for Holders of Indian Tribal Prison Facility Bonds. Section 6401(b)(1) is amended to include this new subpart.
