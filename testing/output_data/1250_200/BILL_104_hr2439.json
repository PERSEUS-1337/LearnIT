    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more flexibility in developing public-private partnerships. Congress recognizes the need for new financial concepts in transportation programs that traditional federal reimbursement programs cannot accommodate. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the state or multi-state level to finance transportation projects. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks through interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. These banks can provide loans and other assistance for eligible transportation projects, programs, or activities, covering part or all of the construction costs. State infrastructure banks established under the \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" can provide loans and other assistance for qualifying transportation projects. The assistance received may be subordinated to other debt financing. To qualify as a State infrastructure bank, each participating State must maintain an investment grade rating on its debt issuances or have sufficient bond or debt financing instrument\\ insurance. The State infrastructure bank must ensure investment income is credited to the bank, available for loans to transportation projects, and invested in Treasury securities. Loan repayments can be credited to the bank or used for eligible purposes. Loans from the bank will bear appropriate interest determined by the bank. The State infrastructure bank must ensure that loaned funds are available for transportation projects, with loans bearing appropriate interest. Repayment must start within 5 years of project completion, with a maximum 30-year repayment term. The bank's annual report to the Secretary is required, and Federal disbursements for capital reserves should align with historic rates for the Federal-aid highway program. The Secretary must ensure that Federal disbursements for capital reserves align with historic rates for the Federal-aid highway program and establish procedures for State infrastructure bank loans. States can transfer up to 15% of certain Federal funds to the bank, with disbursements not exceeding the traditional rate for the highway program. Federal apportionments deposited into the bank do not create obligations for the United States. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create obligations for the United States. State infrastructure banks are not guaranteed by the United States, and any debt issued by them does not imply a commitment from the US. Additionally, certain provisions of title 31, United States Code, do not apply to funds used as a capital reserve under this Act. States can contribute up to 2% of Federal funds deposited into the bank for administrative costs."
