    "content": "The Act titled \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" aims to prevent fraudulent prescriptions. The \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" amends the Controlled Substances Act to require practitioners to comply with specific reporting requirements when prescribing controlled substances in schedule II or III. This includes submitting patient information, prescription details, and the practitioner's DEA registration. The \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" mandates practitioners to report details such as the prescribed substance, DEA registration number, contact information, and prescription pad number. Exceptions include medical emergencies and a 7-day window for submitting required information after prescribing a controlled substance. Reporting requirements also apply to dispensing. Before dispensing a controlled substance in schedule II or III, a practitioner must submit required information to the Attorney General through a web portal. This includes details like the purchaser's name, date of birth, address, dispensing date and time, substance name and amount, and whether it's a refill. Before declining to dispense a controlled substance in schedule II or III, a practitioner must submit necessary information to the Attorney General through a web portal. This includes the practitioner's DEA registration number, contact information, and any reason to suspect fraud by the individual attempting to purchase the substance. The Attorney General establishes a web portal for practitioners to submit information regarding controlled substances. The portal alerts practitioners if a patient has refilled the same prescription multiple times, attempted to obtain multiple prescriptions within 30 days, or has a history of purchasing controlled substances. The Attorney General establishes a database to track information on controlled substances, including patients with suspicious purchasing patterns or attempts to unlawfully obtain prescriptions. The Attorney General maintains a database with reported information on controlled substances. Information can be disclosed for alerts to practitioners or to law enforcement agencies for investigations related to unlawful diversion or misuse of controlled substances in schedule II or III. The Attorney General can disclose reported information on controlled substances in schedule II or III for investigations or proceedings. Information can be shared if it is not individually identifiable and will be used for research purposes. Funding for this subsection comes from the Diversion Control Fee Account. The Attorney General can disclose reported information on controlled substances in schedule II or III for investigations or proceedings, as per the Controlled Substances Act. The applicability date for certain sections of the Act depends on the operational status of a web portal and database required by the Attorney General."
