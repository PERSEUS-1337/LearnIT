    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that decommissioned firearms from law enforcement agencies have been used in numerous crimes, including homicides, assaults, and drug-related offenses. Additionally, firearms sold by law enforcement agencies have been traced to crimes, such as a shooting near a playground. Many State and local law enforcement departments also resell firearms confiscated from crimes, including assault weapons that were in circulation before the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 restricted assault weapons in circulation. Law enforcement departments in various states have started destroying decommissioned firearms to reduce the number of firearms on the streets. The purpose of this Act is to prevent the transfer of decommissioned firearms to individuals. The Attorney General is authorized to provide grants to States or local governments for purchasing new firearms and destroying decommissioned firearms. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local government must have a policy that prohibits transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals and requires their destruction, with an exception for law enforcement agencies. Grants can only be used to purchase new firearms. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment for grant applications. SEC. 6. REPORTING.\n\nA State or local government must report to the Attorney General within 2 years of receiving funds under this Act on its implementation. The report must include budget assurances for law enforcement agencies to purchase firearms without transferring decommissioned ones.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITION.\n\nDefines \"decommissioned firearm\" as a firearm no longer in use by law enforcement or confiscated in a crime and no longer needed for evidence. \"Firearm\" and \"person\" have standard legal definitions.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005."
