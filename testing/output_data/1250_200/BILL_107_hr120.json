    "content": "The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" aims to prioritize the solvency of social security and Medicare by prohibiting the use of their surpluses for any other purpose until legislation is passed to extend their trust funds' solvency. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" prohibits the use of surpluses for any other purpose until solvency legislation is enacted. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" prohibits the use of baseline budget surpluses until solvency legislation is enacted. Baseline budget surpluses are defined as the sum of on- and off-budget surpluses in the most recent baseline budget projections made by the Congressional Budget Office. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" restricts the use of baseline budget surpluses until solvency legislation is passed. Baseline budget surpluses include on- and off-budget surpluses in Congressional Budget Office projections. Legislation affecting revenues or direct spending must offset any reductions or increases to maintain budget balance. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" requires that any net increase in direct spending or discretionary outlays must be offset by increases in revenues. Additionally, a social security solvency certification is needed to ensure the balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund over a 75-year period. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" mandates a Medicare solvency certification by the Board of Trustees for the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to ensure actuarial balance over a 30-year period. Additionally, amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 require a supermajority for certain provisions. The Act will be effective upon enactment and will only apply to fiscal year 2001 and beyond."
