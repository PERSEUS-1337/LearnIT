The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts for achieving energy savings and related benefits. Contracts can last up to 25 years, with obligations to finance energy conservation measures as long as guaranteed savings exceed debt service requirements. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts for achieving energy savings and related benefits. Contracts can last up to 25 years, with obligations to finance energy conservation measures as long as guaranteed savings exceed debt service requirements. The contract must be available and adequate for payment of costs, governed by Federal Acquisition Regulation, and require the contractor to incur costs for implementing energy savings measures in exchange for a share of resulting energy savings. An annual energy audit is also required. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts lasting up to 25 years. The contract requires an annual energy audit, specifies terms and conditions for Government payments and performance guarantees, and limits annual payments to ensure savings to the Department. Maintenance and repair services for energy-related equipment are included in the performance guarantee. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts lasting up to 25 years. The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, will issue final rules within 90 days to establish procedures for selecting, monitoring, and terminating these contracts in a cost-effective manner. The rules will ensure energy savings are calculated using sound engineering and financial practices. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to request qualifications from firms providing energy savings services and designate qualified firms based on certain criteria. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to designate qualified firms to provide energy savings services and select firms for discussions and proposals for energy savings projects.

The Secretary may maintain energy savings performance contracts under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, with modifications as necessary. A pilot program for nonbuilding applications allows up to 10 contracts to demonstrate energy savings benefits, with a report due to Congress after three years. The pilot program for nonbuilding applications allows up to 10 contracts to demonstrate energy savings benefits, with a report due to Congress after three years. The report should include project descriptions, energy and cost savings, and recommendations on extending or expanding the program. Energy savings are defined as a reduction in energy costs resulting from various measures in federally owned buildings or facilities. The term \"energy savings performance contract\" refers to a contract that involves services for energy conservation measures at one or more locations, including software licensing agreements. For public buildings, the contract must comply with specific requirements. The term \"nonbuilding application\" pertains to applications outside of federally owned buildings or facilities. The Accountability Act of 1959 defines \"nonbuilding application\" as transportable vehicles or equipment that consume energy for transport or environmental control, and \"secondary savings\" as additional energy or cost savings resulting from energy efficiency improvements financed through energy savings performance contracts. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Defense and the benefits of energy efficiency improvements include cost savings, environmental benefits, and increased revenue from electricity sales."
