    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\". Judicial review is addressed in the Act. The \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\" addresses judicial review, allowing affected small entities to petition for review of a final rule's economic impact certification or regulatory flexibility analysis within one year of its effective date. A court with jurisdiction over rule compliance can review the certification or analysis. The \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\" allows affected small entities to petition for judicial review within one year of a final rule's effective date. The court can order corrective action if the agency's certification or analysis is found to be arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. The court may order corrective action if the agency's final regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared in accordance with the required procedure. If the agency fails to comply within 90 days, the court can stay the rule or grant appropriate relief. The court must consider the rule of prejudicial error when making any determination. Any regulatory flexibility analysis for a rule is part of the record for judicial review. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply only to final agency rules issued after the date of enactment of this Act. Nothing in this section bars judicial review of any other impact statement or similar analysis required by any other law if judicial review of such statement or analysis is otherwise provided by law. SEC. 3. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy must receive proposed rules and initial regulatory flexibility analysis from agencies before publication. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy must provide a statement of the effect of proposed rules on small entities within 15 days of receiving them. The agency must publish this statement and its response in the Federal Register when issuing general notice of proposed rulemaking. Proposed rules by certain federal agencies related to monetary policy or housing oversight are subject to a special rule. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, in connection with monetary policy or ensuring the safety of federally insured depository institutions, affiliates, credit unions, or government sponsored housing enterprises, is exempt from certain requirements. Section 603(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended accordingly. Congress believes that the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration should have the ability to appear as amicus curiae in court cases reviewing rules."
