The Global Fund, operational since January 2002, includes representatives from donor and recipient governments, NGOs, the private sector, and affected communities. With a small Secretariat in Geneva, the Fund serves as a financial instrument to mobilize resources for disease control. Recipient countries form Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) to prioritize national needs and submit funding applications. The Global Fund, established in January 2002, works with Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) in recipient countries to prioritize national needs and submit funding applications. CCMs include representatives from government, NGOs, private sector, aid agencies, academic institutions, and affected communities. Applications are reviewed by a Technical Review Panel, and grants are overseen by a Local Fund Agent. Grant-making occurs in \"Rounds\" to ensure continuous funding for projects, including treatment initiatives. President George W. Bush announced the launch of PEPFAR in 2003. PEPFAR, authorized in May 2003, consolidated existing efforts into a single program headed by a Global AIDS Coordinator. Randall Tobias was appointed to the post by President Bush in July 2003. The initiative promised $9 billion over five years for AIDS projects in the most afflicted countries. PEPFAR, authorized in May 2003, promised $9 billion over five years for AIDS projects in the most afflicted countries. This new funding is channeled through the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative directed by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator. PEPFAR also committed $5 billion for ongoing bilateral AIDS programs in other countries and $1 billion to the Global Fund. Overall, PEPFAR represents $10 billion in additional funds beyond existing programs. Despite criticism, PEPFAR aims to support treatment for 2 million HIV-infected people by 2008, prevent 7 million new infections, and provide care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS. The PEPFAR Global HIV/AIDS Initiative supported antiretroviral therapy for over 235,000 AIDS patients by March 2005. In addition, prevention messages reached 120 million people in focus countries, with 96 million condoms distributed for high-risk populations. The Global Fund approved 316 grants in 127 countries by July 2005, providing HIV therapy for 220,000 patients, testing and counseling for 2.5 million, and support for 397,000 orphans. Overlapping programs supported by both PEPFAR and the Global Fund benefited 63,000 patients in 2004. The Global Fund estimated needing $7 billion in 2006-2007 to cover existing grants and future applications. Donors pledged $3.7 billion in 2005, but without more pledges, the fund may struggle to address new challenges. The board approved grants totaling $382 million, with $344 million pending additional pledges. If more funding isn't secured by mid-2006, some grants may be denied. The Global Fund received $275 million in initial contributions from the United States in the first half of 2006. The Administration requested $200 million annually for FY2003 through FY2005, but Congress provided more each year. For FY2006, the Administration raised its request to $300 million, reflecting Congress's preference for larger contributions. House and Senate versions of FY2006 appropriations also allocated more funds for the Global Fund than requested. In FY2004, $87.8 million of the Global Fund appropriation was withheld due to legislative provisions limiting the U.S. contribution. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations legislation directed these funds to be provided in FY2005, subject to the 33% proviso. The Senate-passed Foreign Operations bill for FY2006 included $100 million transferred from the Economic Support Fund. The U.S. contribution for 2005 was estimated at about 29% of total contributions. At a pledging conference in London in September 2005, the U.S. pledged at least $600 million for the Global Fund for 2006 and 2007. This amount represented 16% of total pledges, with France pledging $631 million. The U.S. contribution would double the Administration's request for FY2006 and make up approximately 28% of the total. Ambassador Tobias emphasized that the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund is a strategic priority in the fight against AIDS. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund is a strategic priority in the fight against AIDS, with the Global Fund and PEPFAR being partners in increasing treatment numbers. Ambassador Tobias and Tommy Thompson have played key roles in U.S.-Global Fund cooperation. Tommy Thompson served as Chairman of the Fund's Board until April 2005. Ambassador Tobias currently heads the Global Fund's Policy and Strategy Committee. The U.S. has a significant stake in the Fund's success due to its history of cooperation and financial contributions. The Global Fund and PEPFAR are considered partners, with their work being complementary in fighting AIDS globally. The United States leverages its investment by contributing to the Global Fund, allowing other donors to participate in the fight against the pandemic. The Global Fund and PEPFAR work together closely to fight the AIDS pandemic, with the Global Fund focusing on building indigenous institutional capacities and PEPFAR providing emergency assistance in heavily affected countries. Both organizations emphasize their partnership and cooperation at the local level. The Global Fund and PEPFAR cooperate at both local and headquarters levels, with USAID providing technical assistance. Despite public statements of partnership, some suspect U.S. officials are not entirely happy with the Global Fund, possibly due to the choice of a non-American Executive Director in 2002. The Fund board selected Dr. Richard Feachem as Executive Director over an American candidate, causing tensions with the United States. The lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war strained relations with the Global Fund. Despite initial skepticism, there is now increased cooperation between PEPFAR and the Global Fund, with the U.S. requesting $300 million for the Fund in FY2006. However, the level of U.S. contributions remains a point of contention. Despite increasing cooperation between PEPFAR and the Global Fund, the level of U.S. contributions remains a point of contention. Fund supporters believe that other donors are unlikely to increase their contributions unless the United States boosts its own level of support. The United States would have to contribute $2.3 billion in FY2006 and FY2007 combined, rather than the $600 million pledged by Ambassador Tobias, to persuade other donors to meet the Global Fund's stated need of $7 billion. Many see an increase for the Global Fund on this scale as unlikely, with competing budget priorities and no guarantee that other donors would follow the U.S. lead. Administration officials argue that the United States has already been generous and should not be expected to do more. The United States has been generous towards the Global Fund, contributing nearly twice as much as all other donors combined. Despite criticism at a meeting in Bangkok, the U.S. remains the largest contributor and is on track to exceed the initially promised $1 billion over five years. There is debate over whether the U.S. should increase its contributions to persuade other donors to meet the Global Fund's $7 billion need. Canada's 2006-2007 pledge was made after the London pledging conference. The United States is contributing the largest share of funds towards fighting the global pandemic. A report by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that the US was contributing 45.4% of funds committed by G7 nations and the European Communities for international AIDS programs. However, when adjusted for Gross National Income, the US ranked third in funding international AIDS programs. UNAIDS estimates the total need for resources to fight AIDS in 2006 at $14.9 billion, with only $8.9 billion likely to be provided, indicating donors are falling short of their fair share contribution. Some argue for a larger U.S. contribution to the Global Fund, accusing the Administration of undermining it. They believe the U.S. should increase its funding due to its world leadership in the fight against AIDS. Some argue that an increase in U.S. funding for the Global Fund is justified as the country has taken on a leadership role in the fight against AIDS. Supporters believe that a larger contribution would demonstrate this leadership and show commitment to a humanitarian cause. They praise the Global Fund for its innovative and multilateral approach, contrasting it with PEPFAR's top-down approach. Many see the Global Fund as crucial in building institutions in developing countries and view it as the primary component of the U.S. response to the pandemic. The Global Fund is seen as a significant international financial mechanism in the battle against communicable diseases, deserving strong support. Many prefer it over PEPFAR's programs due to restrictions like the requirement to allocate funds for abstinence-until-marriage programs and oppose commercial sex work. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of these requirements and their impact on NGOs' ability to work effectively. The Global Fund does not have such restrictions, making it a more favorable option for some. The U.S. funds the Global Fund but has not signed the prostitution pledge. Some believe PEPFAR's bilateral efforts are superior, emphasizing U.S. agency involvement and coordination through embassies. PEPFAR also contributes to building local capacity and governance through training and infrastructure programs. Some argue that a large bilateral program under U.S. control is necessary for domestic political support and funding for fighting AIDS. Restrictions on PEPFAR funds reflect U.S. values and are seen as crucial for gaining majority support in Congress. Global Fund programs have faced difficulties, leading to suspensions in countries like Ukraine and Uganda. Supporters believe these suspensions show effective oversight and can incentivize recipient countries to improve grant management capabilities. The Global Fund's oversight mechanisms are effective and transparent, serving as an incentive for recipient countries to strengthen grant management. Grants to Ukraine and Uganda are being resumed with conditions for governance improvements. The debate between Global Fund and PEPFAR programs is seen as unfortunate, as both are vital in the fight against AIDS. Some believe the Global Fund should receive necessary resources without detracting from bilateral efforts. The United States has already made substantial contributions to the Global Fund. The United States has contributed significantly to the Global Fund, with concerns that a failure to mobilize resources for the AIDS pandemic would reflect poorly on U.S. policy. There are doubts that PEPFAR can achieve its objectives without supporting the Global Fund. Leveraging larger contributions for the Global Fund is challenging due to finite resources in appropriations bills. Executive branch agencies tend to prioritize bilateral programs over multilateral ones in budget discussions. Some Global Fund advocates believe a larger budget request is needed from the Administration to increase contributions. However, expanding funding for the Global Fund may be challenging due to concerns over the federal deficit and high levels of spending on other priorities. There are debates on repealing legislative provisions limiting the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to 33% of all contributions. Some argue for repealing the provision limiting the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to 33%, while others suggest increasing efforts to persuade other donors or engaging private sector donors and the general public. There are debates on how to advocate for the Global Fund, including using bilateral capabilities and public advocacy by top U.S. officials. Some suggest engaging private sector donors and the general public to contribute to the Global Fund, citing the potential of popular music events like Live Aid. Non-government sources, apart from the Gates Foundation, have only contributed modest amounts so far, indicating untapped potential for larger donations. Some believe there is untapped potential for larger contributions to the Global Fund from alternative sources, while others see the current low numbers as evidence of limited potential. Boosting Global Fund resources is seen as crucial for fulfilling U.S. objectives in combating the Global AIDS pandemic."
