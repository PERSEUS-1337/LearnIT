    "content": "Many Members of the 116th Congress are interested in Trump Administration's efforts to reform USAID, known as Transformation at USAID. The reform process began in 2017 with an executive order and OMB memorandum, aiming to make the agency more efficient. USAID submitted its own reform plan to OMB, separate from the State Department's \"redesign\" initiative. OMB's government-wide reform plan, released in June 2018, included several reforms directly related to USAID. The reform plan \"Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century,\" released in June 2018, prescribed 32 government-wide reforms, including restructuring U.S. humanitarian assistance programs, establishing a new Development Finance Institution, and changing USAID's bureau structure in Washington, DC. USAID began implementing its reforms, known as Transformation, but there is no comprehensive public report detailing the effort. Various sources provide information on specific reforms, making it challenging to understand the full scope and prioritization of USAID's Transformation. The Transformation reforms proposed by USAID do not require congressional approval, but some need advance notification to Congress. Administrator Green has involved Congress in shaping and implementing the reforms and stated he won't proceed without congressional support. Congress can influence USAID reforms through oversight and funding requirements. This report analyzes key elements of current USAID reform efforts under Transformation, highlighting key reforms and changes in policy and practice. The report discusses key objectives of Transformation at USAID, including process, structure, and workforce reforms. Administrator Green described Transformation as experience-informed, innovation-driven reforms to optimize effectiveness. While some reforms are similar to general government efforts, others signal a distinct vision for USAID's role in foreign affairs. The report does not provide a comprehensive overview of the initiative. The report discusses key objectives of Transformation at USAID, including process, structure, and workforce reforms. Administrator Green described Transformation as experience-informed, innovation-driven reforms to optimize effectiveness. Key objectives include supporting country transitions towards self-reliant development, increasing collaboration with the private sector, and using taxpayer dollars more efficiently. The core objective is to move partner countries towards economic self-sufficiency, with a focus on ending the need for foreign assistance. Other objectives, such as advancing national security goals, are less emphasized in later Transformation materials. The Transformation at USAID focuses on optimizing effectiveness through experience-informed, innovation-driven reforms. Key objectives include supporting country transitions towards self-reliant development, increasing collaboration with the private sector, and using taxpayer dollars more efficiently. Past administrations have also sought to refine foreign assistance deployment to advance national security goals. Transformation is seen as the latest step in USAID's evolution towards improving efficiency and effectiveness. The agency is implementing changes to establish a more flexible approach to programming under Transformation, aligning with global development trends. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is the guiding principle, focusing on countries' ability to address their own challenges without foreign assistance. USAID uses a matrix of 17 indicators to measure progress towards self-reliance, sourced from third-party institutions. USAID selected indicators based on alignment with self-reliance concept, reputation of reporting institutions, data availability, comparability, and comprehensiveness. The matrix divides indicators into Commitment and Capacity measures to assess a country's desire to progress and resources to move beyond poverty. This informs USAID's Country Development Cooperation Strategies to prioritize self-reliance and capacity-building. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is a unique approach by USAID to prioritize self-sufficiency in country strategies. It aims to tailor development programs to each country's challenges while using common metrics. The self-reliance indicators cover a wide range of issues without judgment on their importance, integrating various development theories into the framework. The indicators selected by USAID for the \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework reflect theories connecting economic growth to democratic institutions and markets. These indicators are divided into \"commitment\" and \"capacity\" composites, with more weight given to the \"commitment\" indicators. USAID advises missions to evaluate these indicators in each country's unique context, as they do not provide a comprehensive diagnosis of development causes. The Administration's focus on country-level indicators for development marks a shift from previous global approaches. USAID's \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework emphasizes national policy and institutions over subnational regions. Critics worry these indicators could lead to aid cuts for underperforming countries. USAID's \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework uses metrics to inform aid allocations, not as scorecards. Poor performance in areas like open government may lead to aid being directed through NGOs instead of national governments. It is unclear if countries' progress will be tracked over time. The framework aims to end the need for foreign assistance through financing and transformation. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID focuses on financing self-reliance and private sector engagement to end the need for foreign assistance. It emphasizes a country's ability to generate capital and partner with the private sector for investment. This approach aligns with global development frameworks like the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and aims to leverage Official Development Assistance to mobilize private sector funds. The \"Transformation\" initiative focuses on financing self-reliance by leveraging Official Development Assistance to mobilize private sector investments in developing countries. It emphasizes domestic resource mobilization, strong public financial management, and fiscal transparency to create an enabling environment for private investment. Private sector engagement is key to the initiative's goal of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Transformation initiative prioritizes effective financial markets for capital access in economic development investments. Private sector engagement is central to repositioning USAID's role and supporting partner country self-sufficiency. USAID's Private Sector Engagement Policy builds on longstanding efforts to leverage resources of nongovernmental actors for international development. The Global Development Alliance program and U.S. Global Development Lab focus on public-private partnerships and innovation to address development challenges. The Private Sector Engagement Policy (PSE Policy) under the Transformation initiative aims to integrate venture capital approaches into USAID programs. It emphasizes business partnerships to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators, shifting focus from economic development programs to individual enterprises. Unlike past efforts, the PSE Policy seeks to infuse a private sector engagement orientation across all programming without specifying favored private sector partners. The Private Sector Engagement Policy (PSE Policy) aims to broaden USAID's partner makeup by integrating nontraditional partners and changing the way USAID engages in program design. The policy is still in early stages of implementation, with potential changes in USAID's implementation approach expected in the coming months. The USAID Acquisition and Assistance Strategy released in February 2019 indicates a shift towards private sector engagement envisioned by Transformation. This includes restructuring engagement methodology and sourcing mechanisms to build partnerships and promote partner self-sufficiency. The USAID Acquisition and Assistance Strategy aims to diversify partner base, support local partner self-reliance, and establish a more flexible partnering approach. Reforms include the New Partnerships Initiative and revisions to operational policies. Past initiatives like USAID Forward have influenced these efforts to promote recipient country ownership of development. Transformation aims to promote recipient country \"ownership\" of development through new partnering modalities like \"co-creation.\" It aligns USAID's organization with U.S. international development goals and has faced congressional oversight. Proposed structural changes are on hold pending further review by committees. The Administrator has signaled that changes to USAID's organization are on hold pending further review by congressional oversight committees. USAID is divided into field missions and headquarters' bureaus and offices, each with specific functions. The proposed reorganization includes adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators to the chain of command. In a proposed reorganization of USAID, two new Associate Administrators would oversee specific bureaus, allowing the Administrator to focus on agency-wide priorities. This three-pronged oversight structure aims to enhance agency representation on the global stage. The proposed reorganization of USAID includes adding two political appointees to focus on agency-wide management priorities and specialized leadership voices. Concerns have been raised about potential politicization of development decisions. The reorganization primarily focuses on restructuring functional and central bureaus, moving from four functional bureaus to five, three central bureaus, and four independent offices. One major proposal is the creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, combining the Offices of Food for Peace and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. The proposed reorganization of USAID includes combining Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) into a new Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA). This consolidation aims to elevate U.S. humanitarian assistance globally and eliminate duplication of efforts in managing international disaster assistance funds. The proposed reorganization of USAID involves combining Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) into a new Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA). This change aims to enhance the management of international disaster assistance funds and improve the response to complex humanitarian emergencies. The HA structural proposal differs from past approaches by dissolving the FFP and OFDA offices as they currently exist. Consultations are ongoing within the U.S. government, Congress, and the humanitarian community regarding the proposed HA. The proposed reorganization of USAID involves combining Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) into a new Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA). Some view this as a positive step forward on reform, while others are skeptical about its impact on interagency cooperation and global humanitarian funding. Concerns have been raised about the potential decline in U.S. in-kind commodities for emergency food assistance and the de-emphasis of nonemergency programs under the new bureau context. The Administration's proposal to create the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate agency functions for better coordination and efficiency. This restructuring involves pulling technical staff from regional bureaus and merging offices from different bureaus into one. The new DDI would provide a centralized hub for missions in the field, offering consultancy services in various areas such as education, environment, private sector engagement, youth, and gender equality. The Administration's proposal to create the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate agency functions for better coordination and efficiency. DDI will provide coordinated consultancy services in areas such as education, environment, private sector engagement, youth, and gender equality. Supporters believe DDI will enhance technical support for programs, while detractors fear it may be unwieldy to manage. USAID's Transformation seeks to modify workforce management structures to adapt to complex situations, including developing new hiring mechanisms and leadership philosophies. The USAID Transformation initiative involves developing new hiring mechanisms, leadership philosophies, and knowledge management frameworks. Staff are hired under various mechanisms, including direct-hire positions with full benefits and non-direct hire positions with varying benefits. The initiative aims to address staffing concerns and improve workforce management structures. The Transformation initiative at USAID aims to address staffing concerns by introducing a new hiring mechanism called the Adaptive Personnel Project (APP). This noncareer, excepted service mechanism is designed to enhance workforce capacity for crisis response. The Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) at USAID offers workforce flexibility by allowing time-limited positions and talent-based classification, providing the agency with the ability to adjust staffing according to its needs. The USAID's Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) aims to offer workforce flexibility through time-limited positions and talent-based classification. The APP pilot will establish 300 positions for crisis response offices, providing equity in benefits for noncareer employees and streamlining processes with a common performance management system. Congressional approval is required to use program funds for the pilot. USAID's APP pilot aims to establish 300 positions for crisis response offices, seeking approval from Congress and OPM to move forward with internal policies. The agency plans to fill these positions in 2020 and expand to 1,200 positions in the following years. Congress may consider the role of foreign assistance in U.S. foreign policy amid concerns about rival powers like China and Russia. Members may consider if the goal of ending the need for foreign assistance aligns with U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, especially in light of rival powers like China and Russia. USAID's programs support U.S. security, diplomatic, and commercial interests, and are seen as a tool of foreign policy to promote development and enhance U.S. influence. If successful, alternative forms of engagement like cultural exchange programs and business ties could help maintain relationships and influence in countries transitioning away from U.S. aid. The Transformation proposal at USAID includes potential budget cuts and the addition of new political appointee positions, raising concerns about politicization. The focus is on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, with potential impact on existing activities. The Transformation proposal at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially impacting existing activities. Administrator Green emphasizes self-reliance roadmaps as a guide for congressional allocation decisions. The Transformation proposal at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially impacting existing activities. Administrator Green emphasizes self-reliance roadmaps as a guide for congressional allocation decisions. The shift to a country-specific aid agenda may conflict with transnational programming funded by Congress. Self-reliance indicators and priorities like operational flexibility in nonpermissive environments and countering violent extremism have not been prominently featured in recent media on the initiative. Congress may consult with USAID to ensure indicator configuration aligns with priorities. The Transformation proposal at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially impacting existing activities. Congress may also consider seeking additional information on how Transformation would align with the Administration's planned Prosper Africa trade and investment initiative. It is unclear how indicators used by the State Department and Millennium Challenge Corporation will be used in conjunction with USAID's new self-reliance indicators. The extent of State Department engagement with Transformation at USAID and alignment with Secretary Pompeo's vision for U.S. diplomatic engagement is also unclear. The proposed merger of the Offices of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance has raised questions about the future of Food for Peace Act Title II programming. The Office of Food for Peace is currently dual-funded, receiving funding through the agriculture appropriations bill and regular farm bills. In the proposed HA Bureau, the Office of Food for Peace would cease to exist in name, and program officers would be programming food and nonfood assistance side-by-side. Congress may seek to understand how the HA Bureau would be structured to ensure it meets its mandates outlined in the farm bill, including the minimum level of nonemergency programming."
