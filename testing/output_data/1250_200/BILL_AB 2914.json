    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12012.75 of the Government Code is amended to create the \"Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund\" in the State Treasury for receiving and distributing money from Indian tribes based on gaming compacts. The California Gambling Control Commission can use the funds to distribute to eligible recipient Indian tribes as specified in the compacts. Section 12012.90 is also amended to outline the application of these funds for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17. Section 12012.90 of the Government Code is amended to require the California Gambling Control Commission to determine and transfer funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund to cover anticipated shortfalls for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17. The California Gambling Control Commission will transfer funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund to cover anticipated shortfalls for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17. Eligible recipient Indian tribes will receive payments based on actual previous year's payments into the trust fund, adjusted for changes in tribal-state gaming compacts. The Legislature will transfer funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for eligible recipient Indian tribes to receive up to $275,000 per quarter, totaling $1,100,000 for the fiscal year. Quarterly payments will be made within 45 days. Surplus funds will remain in the trust fund for future disbursement. Adjustments may be made to future distributions if necessary. If the allocated amount for eligible recipient Indian tribes is insufficient to provide $275,000 per quarter, the Department of Finance will request a budget increase from the Legislature, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, explaining the shortfall. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the California Gambling Control Commission's report will identify eligible recipient Indian tribes, the amount paid by each tribe into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, and the shortfall needed from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to ensure each tribe receives $275,000 for the quarter."
