    "content": "The \"Protecting American Lives Act\" defines key terms and ensures that if any provision is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. It also addresses information sharing regarding criminal aliens. Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to update terminology and specify law enforcement activities related to inadmissible and deportable aliens encountered by state law enforcement personnel. It also emphasizes compliance with requests for information from Federal law enforcement. The amendment prohibits Federal, State, or local government entities from issuing policies that violate Federal law or restrict compliance with Federal law enforcement. States or political subdivisions with policies prohibiting cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement will not be eligible for certain funds. The amendment prohibits jurisdictions from receiving certain funds if they do not comply with Federal law enforcement requirements. The Secretary of Homeland Security must annually determine non-compliant states or political subdivisions and report to Congress. Any jurisdiction not compliant with Federal law enforcement requirements will be ineligible for financial assistance for at least 1 year. Funds not allocated due to non-compliance will be reallocated to compliant states or political subdivisions. State and local law enforcement must provide information about apprehended aliens. States and political subdivisions must provide identifying information about apprehended aliens to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Non-compliant jurisdictions will be ineligible for financial assistance, and compliant states will be reimbursed for reasonable costs incurred. The section states that law enforcement officials are not required to provide information on crime victims or witnesses to the Secretary of Homeland Security, nor are they obligated to report or arrest them. SEC. 4. CLARIFYING THE AUTHORITY OF ICE DETAINERS. The Secretary is required to execute lawful writs, process, and orders issued by the United States. States or political subdivisions that refuse to comply with DHS detainers will lose funding and grants. States and political subdivisions are granted immunity when acting in accordance with this provision. The Department grants immunity to States or political subdivisions that comply with detainers to hold or transport aliens for transfer to Federal custody. Congress believes the Department has probable cause when issuing a detainer for inadmissible or deportable aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to increase the minimum sentence for illegal reentry to not less than 5 years. This change applies to various subsections within the Act."
