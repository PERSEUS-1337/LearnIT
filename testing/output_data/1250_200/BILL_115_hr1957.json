    "content": "The \"Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that bullying and harassment in schools can seriously harm students' physical and psychological health, leading to high dropout rates and academic underachievement. These behaviors include physical violence, name-calling, intimidation, and cyberbullying. Schools with anti-bullying policies have higher reporting levels and teacher involvement. Students are targeted for bullying based on various factors like race, gender, and disability. Some experience relational aggression, damaging relationships and social acceptance. Interventions like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports aim to create a positive school climate and reduce bullying incidents. Evidence-based discipline policies like PBIS and restorative practices can reduce suspensions and expulsions, preventing students from being pushed out to the juvenile justice system. 85% of Americans support a Federal law to prevent bullying in schools, calling for leadership to address the national crisis of bullying and harassment. The purpose of the Safe Schools Improvement part is to address bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools through anti-bullying policies. The Safe Schools Improvement part addresses bullying, including cyberbullying, in public schools by requiring policies that prevent severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that limits a student's participation or creates a hostile environment based on race or other factors. The Safe Schools Improvement part mandates policies in public schools to prohibit bullying or harassment based on various factors such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or other defining characteristics. It also requires annual notice of prohibited conduct and grievance procedures for complaints. The Safe Schools Improvement part requires public schools to have discipline policies and grievance procedures for complaints regarding prohibited conduct. It also mandates collecting and reporting accurate data on incidents at the school level while ensuring victims' confidentiality. Positive and preventative approaches are encouraged. The agency must ensure that victims or perpetrators of misconduct remain anonymous and promote positive disciplinary approaches in schools to reduce student removal from instruction and prevent disproportionate punishment. State reports are required from the chief executive officer of a State receiving a grant under this title, in collaboration with the State educational agency. The report should include information from local educational agencies and outline the State's plans to support efforts in addressing prohibited conduct. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a biennial evaluation of anti-bullying programs in schools, assessing their effectiveness and parent involvement. Data on prohibited conduct is collected by the Commissioner for Education Statistics. A report on the evaluation findings must be submitted to the President and Congress every two years. This evaluation does not affect other laws. The curr_chunk states that federal and state nondiscrimination laws, such as title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, are not invalidated by this part. It also mentions that free speech and expression laws are not altered by this part. The text chunk discusses the rule of construction regarding the prevention of bullying or harassment of students by State or local entities, ensuring that their laws are not inconsistent with this part. It also includes amendments to the table of contents of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 related to safe schools improvement."
