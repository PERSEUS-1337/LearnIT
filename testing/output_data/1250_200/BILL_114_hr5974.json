    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coptic Churches Accountability Act\". In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, pledged to rebuild the damaged churches. President Sisi also attended a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2015, showing support for the community. In response to the August 2013 sectarian violence in Egypt, efforts have been made to restore damaged churches. The Egyptian military has restored 26 out of 78 churches, while private citizens have repaired 23 buildings. However, 29 buildings in 24 locations still need restoration as of September 6, 2016. Additionally, a new law passed in August 2016 imposes challenges on church construction in Egypt. In El-`Our, Minya, villagers protested the building of a new church in honor of Egyptian Christians beheaded by Da'esh militants. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails and bricks targeted the church and a Christian-owned vehicle, leading to government officials participating in reconciliation sessions to address sectarian violence. The Coptic Christians in Egypt have been the indigenous people for over 2,000 years and represent the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Informal reconciliation sessions have been used to address sectarian violence, but human rights groups argue that they often lead to unfavorable outcomes for religious minorities. The United States plays a significant role in protecting religious minorities internationally, as stated in the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. Religious freedom is a fundamental right that promotes democracy, individual liberty, and stability. It is a priority for the United States to promote this value in its engagement with other countries. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Secretary of State must provide a report to Congress every year until 2021 on the progress of restoring Christian religious properties in Egypt damaged during sectarian violence in August 2013, including discussions with Egyptian officials. The report should also cover the implementation of a law for constructing Christian churches and the status of Egyptian laws and policies. The Secretary of State must include information in annual reports on the number of permits issued for the construction of Christian churches in Egypt, as well as details on Egyptian laws and policies regarding Christian worship. The curr_chunk discusses the destruction of Christian properties during sectarian violence in August 2013, including schools, hospitals, monuments, relics, and holy sites, along with artwork, manuscripts, vestments, vessels, and other artifacts belonging to Christian churches."
