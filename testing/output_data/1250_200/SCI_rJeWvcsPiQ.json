    "content": "Deep neural networks, like DenseNet, have high computational costs due to dense connections. A reinforcement learning framework is designed to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) to reduce redundancy. This approach maintains DenseNet's advantages while improving trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results show that DenseNet with LWP is more compact and efficient compared to other alternatives. The study proposes a layer-wise pruning method for DenseNet using reinforcement learning to reduce redundancy and improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The agent learns to prune weights and connections to meet computational budget and accuracy requirements. The study proposes a layer-wise pruning method for DenseNet using reinforcement learning to reduce redundancy and improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The agent automatically generates a curriculum of exploration for effective pruning of neural networks. The controller makes decisions for connecting previous layers in the DenseNet, with the output vector representing the likelihood probability of connections being kept. The action space complexity is NP-hard, and connections are sampled from a probability distribution. The study introduces a layer-wise pruning method for DenseNet using reinforcement learning to enhance computational efficiency. The controller decides on connections between previous layers based on a probability distribution, aiming to maximize expected rewards. The training process involves curriculum learning, joint training, and training from scratch. Results on CIFAR datasets show improved efficiency with maintained accuracy.
