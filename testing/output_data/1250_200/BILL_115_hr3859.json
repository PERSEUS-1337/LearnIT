    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drinking Water Infrastructure for Job Creation Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of infrastructure investments in creating jobs and meeting critical needs in the United States. Data from the Brookings Institution shows that infrastructure jobs employed nearly 14.5 million workers in 2013, with competitive wages for low-income workers. The American Society of Civil Engineers graded the US infrastructure as a \"D+\" in 2017, estimating a need for $4.59 trillion by 2025 to improve the nation's infrastructure. Drinking water infrastructure received a \"D\" grade, while wastewater infrastructure received a \"D+\" grade. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave a \"D\" grade to the Nation's drinking water infrastructure and a \"D+\" grade to the Nation's wastewater infrastructure. It is estimated that the United States will need to invest $150 billion by 2025 to bring them to a state of good repair. The EPA reported that exposure to lead can cause serious health problems, with an estimated 6.5 to 10 million homes nationwide receiving drinking water through lead service lines. Congress created the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in 1996 to help eligible public water systems finance infrastructure projects to comply with Federal regulations. In 2013, the EPA estimated that $384 billion in improvements are needed for the Nation's drinking water infrastructure over 20 years to ensure safety. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to assist eligible public water systems in improving infrastructure. Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds will enable States to expand investments in drinking water infrastructure, addressing the significant need for improvements in communities throughout the United States. Restricting appropriations through budget caps or sequestration undermines economic recovery and job creation efforts, disrupts planning, and leaves critical infrastructure needs unmet. Emergency supplemental appropriations of $7.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2017 will improve infrastructure, create jobs, and allow for efficient use of funds to address critical needs in eligible public water systems. Emergency supplemental appropriations of $7.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2017 are designated as an emergency requirement and exempt from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
