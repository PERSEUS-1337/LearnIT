    "content": "Recent events have reignited congressional interest in safe management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. The Fukushima Dai-ichi incident in Japan and the termination of the Yucca Mountain project have increased concerns. This report focuses on the current situation of spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States, emphasizing the need for a geological repository for long-term disposal. The debate over the disposal of nuclear waste in the United States, particularly the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada, has been ongoing for years. The project was terminated in 2009, but discussions and legal battles continue. The need for extended storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is certain, with no clear consensus on interim storage solutions. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future released a final report in 2012, sparking renewed debate on SNF management strategies and storage locations. The debate over nuclear waste disposal in the US has been ongoing for years, with no clear consensus on interim storage solutions. Various organizations have differing views on safety and storage methods, including the use of dry storage. Recommendations include constructing an interim centralized storage facility and consolidating storage at a smaller number of existing reactor sites. The primary storage technologies in the US are wet pool storage and dry cask storage. Senator Dianne Feinstein has jurisdiction over the NRC and the US. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations, believes that spent fuel management needs to be rethought. She advocates for quicker movement of spent fuel from wet pools to safer dry cask storage, citing concerns about long-term storage in pools. Feinstein has urged the NRC to consider policies that encourage this transition, referencing successful dry cask storage practices in Japan. Senator Feinstein has urged the NRC to require a faster shift of nuclear fuel from spent fuel pools to dry cask storage systems, citing safety concerns. The NRC has considered this issue as part of its response to the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident. Consolidating spent fuel in a single, secure site is seen as a way to improve public confidence in nuclear power and fulfill federal obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the Department of Energy to take responsibility for spent fuel storage. Worldwide, there are 436 operational nuclear power reactors in 32 countries, with no country having an operating permanent disposal site for high-level nuclear waste. The United States has not fully addressed its nuclear waste issues, relying on long-term storage for spent nuclear fuel. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico has been operating since 1999 as a permanent repository for plutonium-contaminated transuranic waste from nuclear weapons operations. It is prohibited from receiving spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level waste, but is considered a model for waste facility siting efforts. Despite the focus on the proposed Yucca Mountain repository, there are reasons to also consider SNF storage issues globally. The delay in opening a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada prolongs the need for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Even if a disposal repository were to start operating soon, the time required to ship SNF would necessitate extended storage. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) mandates waste acceptance since 1998, but no disposal repository has been completed. Commercial interim storage may be needed until at least 2056, according to DOE projections. The NWPA sets a limit on waste in the first repository, with 90% allocated to commercial SNF and high-level waste. The remaining 10% is for DOE waste, filling the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. The current quantity of SNF and high-level waste stored would exceed the legal limit for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository, requiring a second repository or a change in the limit. DOE believes Yucca Mountain could hold more waste than the legal limit and could accommodate a larger inventory. Interim storage technologies may be needed for a longer period if waste is stored at a consolidated site. MIT suggests planning for century-long interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. National policies regarding long-term SNF storage need consideration. The issues and options associated with current national policies on long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) have been discussed. Various attempts have been made over the years to establish permanent geologic repositories, including the Yucca Mountain site. However, challenges have led to proposals for interim storage solutions, such as surface storage and monitored retrievable storage facilities. Efforts to find a voluntary host community for a repository or consolidated storage site have been unsuccessful. Analysts have suggested interim on-site storage using dry casks as a viable option. Analysts recommend interim storage of spent nuclear fuel for at least 100 years due to its long-term radioactivity. While stored fuel poses risks, there have been no significant public exposures or health impacts from any releases. Concerns have been raised about potential releases from stored spent nuclear fuel (SNF), especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident. Extended storage raises safety concerns, including risks from extreme weather and sea level rise. The NRC found that sea level rise is not a credible threat to existing and planned on-site nuclear waste storage. The federal government faces a growing liability to pay claims from utilities for failing to accept nuclear waste, costing approximately $1 billion. Concerns about nuclear waste management have hindered investment in new nuclear power plants, leading to industry stagnation. The nuclear industry's failure to expand is attributed to high capital costs and concerns about nuclear waste management. Experts warn that the buildup of spent fuel and lack of progress on final disposition could hinder growth by discouraging investment in new nuclear power plants. Public acceptance of nuclear energy hinges on the availability of a geologic repository in the near future. The current impasse in the U.S. nuclear waste program is seen as a major obstacle. The recent report by the BRC highlighted the impasse in the U.S. nuclear waste program, which is hindering the expansion of nuclear power. This failure is damaging to various aspects including energy supply options, state-federal relations, public confidence, and America's global standing in nuclear safety and security. Thirteen states have laws preventing the construction of new nuclear power plants until the issue of spent fuel backlog is addressed. The curr_chunk discusses the composition of nuclear fuel assemblies, highlighting the differences between boiling water reactors (BWR) and pressurized water reactors (PWR). It also mentions the limitations imposed by state laws on adding new nuclear reactors until the waste issue is resolved. This information provides background for informed debates on spent nuclear fuel storage. The curr_chunk explains the operation of light water reactors, using low-enriched uranium pellets for nuclear fission to generate electricity. Fuel rods last around 54 months, with refueling every 18 months. Spent fuel assemblies are removed when power output decreases due to radionuclide accumulation. The accumulation of radionuclides from uranium fission reduces power output in nuclear reactors. Spent fuel assemblies, which generate heat and radiation, must be removed to maintain electricity production levels. Commercial reactors in the US produce around 2,000 MT of spent nuclear fuel annually, requiring careful management for thousands of years. This report focuses on commercial spent nuclear fuel, distinct from other types like those from the Department of Energy. The report focuses on commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the US, which amounts to 67,450 MTU, compared to noncommercial SNF types like those from DOE production reactors and naval propulsion reactors. These noncommercial SNF types have different designs but share the same radioactivity hazard and long-term isolation needs as commercial SNF. The report focuses on commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the US, totaling 67,450 MTU. This inventory does not include noncommercial SNF types from DOE production reactors and naval propulsion reactors. Commercial SNF is stored in wet pools or dry casks, with wet storage pools being the most common method, accounting for 73% of the inventory. Dry cask storage makes up the remaining 27%. NRC regulates both wet fuel pools and dry cask installations. The NRC regulates wet fuel pools and dry cask installations for storing spent nuclear fuel. Wet storage pools are constructed with thick concrete walls and stainless steel liners, filled with water around 40 feet deep to shield workers from radiation and cool the fuel assemblies. The pools vary in size but can store fuel rods vertically, with controlled water chemistry to minimize corrosion. Designs of the storage basins differ among reactor types, such as boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The design of storage pools for spent nuclear fuel varies among reactor types, such as boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The GE Mark I BWR, used at Fukushima Dai-ichi and other plants, has a storage pool located inside the secondary containment structure. The pool is approximately 35 feet wide, 40 feet long, and 39 feet deep, with a water capacity of almost 400,000 gallons. The SNF storage pools in BWR Mark I reactors are located above ground level with capacities ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 assemblies. U.S. spent fuel pools are typically filled up to three-quarters capacity, while Fukushima Dai-ichi site has a separate building with 6,000 spent fuel assemblies. U.S. reactor facilities lack additional wet storage buildings for SNF consolidation like Fukushima Dai-ichi. Power is crucial for maintaining water levels in wet pools to prevent fuel exposure. Dry casks are cylindrical containers made of steel and concrete used for storing spent nuclear fuel. They are designed to prevent the fuel from overheating and boiling off the cooling water. These casks can weigh over 100 metric tons and are stored outside on concrete pads or in storage bunkers. The largest dry casks in the United States can hold up to 40 pressurized water reactor spent fuel assemblies. The NUHOMS 61BT dry cask storage container weighs 22 tons empty and 44 tons loaded with spent nuclear fuel. Different dry casks can hold varying amounts of spent fuel assemblies, with the largest licensed in the US holding up to 40 PWR or 68 BWR assemblies. The Transportation, Aging, and Disposal Canister System proposed by DOE can hold up to 21 PWR or 44 BWR assemblies. Dry casks require no power for cooling as natural convection of air through the concrete shell is sufficient. NRC regulates dry cask storage systems, with over 50 types approved for use in the US. Dry cask storage containers do not rely on power for cooling, unlike wet storage pool systems. Dry cask storage demonstrated resilience during an earthquake in 2011, with no significant impact on the storage casks or spent nuclear fuel. NRC issues general and site-specific licenses for dry storage facilities, with regulations outlined in Part 72. The NRC regulations in Part 72 govern the dry storage of power reactor spent fuel, both on and off-site. The first commercial dry SNF storage system in the US was established in 1986 at the North Anna nuclear power plant in Virginia. Since then, the use of dry cask storage has increased rapidly, with a significant rise in the amount of SNF transferred to dry cask storage in recent years. The amount of SNF stored in wet pools compared to dry systems has decreased over time, with an increase in the amount of SNF stored in wet pools from 2002 to 2011. The amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in wet pools increased by 10% from 2002 to 2011, while SNF stored in dry systems increased by 286% during the same period. The trend towards more dry cask storage is likely to continue due to the changing economic value and uncertainty about SNF disposal. Spent nuclear fuel is stored at 77 different sites in the United States. The United States currently stores approximately 67,450 MTU of commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at various sites, including operating nuclear power reactors, former reactor sites, DOE-operated facilities, and the proposed reprocessing plant in Morris, IL. Most of the SNF is stored in wet pools at reactor sites, with plans for storage up to 300 years. Dry cask storage is also used at 55 locations for SNF storage. At 74 sites in the United States, commercial spent fuel is stored in wet pools and dry cask storage. 55 locations use dry cask storage, while 27 sites rely solely on wet pool storage. Some sites have stranded SNF storage where reactors have been shut down. Most SNF storage is near the reactors that generated it. Most SNF storage is located near operating or shut down nuclear reactors, with stranded sites facing higher storage costs due to lack of shared overhead expenses. SNF is stored at various commercial and DOE-owned sites, with the majority of stranded SNF located at five sites. The DOE operates an SNF storage facility in Colorado from a reactor shut down in 1989. Concerns arise about repackaging SNF stored in dry cask storage without a wet storage pool. The Blue Ribbon Commission emphasizes the need for safe, consolidated storage capacity. Most SNF storage in the US is concentrated in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The majority of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is stored in eastern sites, with a higher percentage stored in wet pools compared to the national average. In contrast, there is a disproportionate amount of SNF stored in dry casks at western sites. The number of assemblies stored in wet pools in the East is significantly higher than in western sites and the national distribution. The share of wet pool storage at western sites is 15%, while the national distribution is 73%. The disproportionate share of SNF in dry cask storage at western sites is due to operator preference. The top five states with the largest amount of SNF stored by metric tons of heavy metal content are Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York, and North Carolina. The top states with the largest amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in dry storage systems are South Carolina, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and California. Rankings vary based on the number of SNF assemblies, with Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina having the most stored assemblies. Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina also lead in SNF stored in wet pools. Overall, Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia have the most SNF in dry storage systems. The amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in storage increases by approximately 2,000 MTU per year in the United States, with variations in storage methods depending on plant operators. Historically, DOE accepted significant amounts of SNF for storage and reprocessing from commercial nuclear power plants, including from the Three Mile Island incident and reprocessing efforts in New York and Illinois. In the 1970s, a small amount of commercial SNF was shipped to the West Valley site in New York for reprocessing. A small amount of commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) was shipped to the West Valley site in New York for reprocessing from commercial reactors in Michigan and New York. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that decommissioning and environmental remediation at the West Valley site will continue until at least 2020, costing $3.7 billion. DOE is responsible for storing SNF at four sites: Fort St. Vrain (CO), Idaho National Laboratory (ID), Savannah River Site (SC), and Hanford Reservation (WA). The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for storing spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at four sites: Fort St. Vrain (CO), Idaho National Laboratory (ID), Savannah River Site (SC), and Hanford Reservation (WA). The DOE-owned inventory of reactor-irradiated nuclear materials is different from commercial SNF due to factors like enrichment level and cladding. DOE continues to produce and accept SNF from research reactors, some of which was reprocessed to extract nuclear materials like plutonium. The Department of Energy (DOE) stores spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at sites like Savannah River Site (SRS) and Hanford site, which contain various irradiated nuclear materials, including plutonium. The SNF at these sites was surplus material from reactors used for nuclear warheads production. Additionally, the Idaho inventory includes SNF from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion program, reprocessed to extract high-enriched uranium for weapons material production. The Department of Energy (DOE) stores spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at sites like Savannah River Site (SRS) and Hanford site, which contain various irradiated nuclear materials, including plutonium. The SNF at these sites was surplus material from reactors used for nuclear warheads production. The Idaho site also houses SNF debris from the Three Mile Island reactor meltdown in 1979. DOE sites store a variety of research reactor SNF, including material from commercial power reactors, test reactors, and medical isotopes. Some SNF stored at DOE sites had corroded by the late 1980s, prompting a security assessment and inventory plans for packaging and processing. The Department of Energy (DOE) has developed detailed plans to secure DOE-owned spent fuel, including production reactor fuel with thin cladding for reprocessing. Recommendations from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board have been partially implemented. About 198 MT of DOE-owned SNF and reactor-irradiated material is stored in wet and dry storage configurations at various sites. Hanford and Fort St. Vrain sites have transferred all SNF to dry casks, while SRS stores material in wet storage pools. Idaho site uses both methods. The Department of Energy (DOE) has detailed plans to secure DOE-owned spent fuel, including reactor-irradiated material stored in wet and dry configurations at various sites. Hanford and Fort St. Vrain sites have transferred all SNF to dry casks, while SRS stores material in wet storage pools. Idaho site uses both methods. DOE is also responsible for high-level waste (HLW) resulting from reprocessing of SNF, which must be accounted for separately from commercial sites to assess the total HLW inventory in the United States. Hanford stores HLW in underground tanks, West Valley and SRS have vitrified HLW, and Idaho stores HLW in liquid and solid forms awaiting treatment. The HLW at the SRS is stored in liquid and solid forms for disposal. Details on storage, treatment facility construction, and operations are not covered in this report. DOE may use the H-canyon for reprocessing materials. The 29 MTU of SNF at the Savannah River Site make up 1.2% of DOE-owned SNF and 0.04% of total SNF in the US. The 29 MTU of SNF at the Savannah River Site make up about 1.2% of DOE-owned SNF and 0.04% of total SNF in the US. After reprocessing, the SNF would be converted to fissile material and liquid radioactive waste. The liquid waste would be processed into borosilicate glass logs for disposal in a geological repository. Evaluating hazards and risks accurately is crucial for SNF management. Spent nuclear fuel poses a significant hazard from radioactivity and long-term hazards from plutonium and uranium. The distinction between \"hazard\" and \"risk\" is essential for decision-making. The distinction between \"hazard\" and \"risk\" is crucial for evaluating the management of spent nuclear fuel. While the hazard of radioactive substances is high, the actual risk depends on factors like containment and exposure pathways. Regulations for SNF storage require assessing the probability and consequences of potential threats, as well as determining the level of protection needed to prevent significant risks to human health and the environment. The high hazard of radioactive substances from spent nuclear fuel demands a high level of protection to prevent significant risks to human health and the environment. SNF assemblies require cooling and shielding during storage, with wet pool storage typically lasting three to five years before transfer to dry cask storage. Concerns have been raised about the safety of current SNF management practices, especially for long-term storage methods. NRC and others have generally considered SNF storage as relatively safe, but some analysts and observers question this assumption. The Yucca Mountain repository project raised concerns about the long-term safety of spent nuclear fuel storage methods. Various threats such as loss of power, external hazards, corrosion, and leakage were identified as potential risks. The Fukushima Dai-ichi facility incident highlighted some of these concerns, including hydrogen explosions and power loss. Following the Fukushima Dai-ichi facility incident, NRC chairman Greg Jaczko testified about the uncovering of fuel in the spent fuel pool with no water. A report by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations stated that fuel damage may have been caused by debris from explosions. The NRC issued a notice for reactor operators to review safety measures for spent fuel storage. The NRC reiterated the process for adopting Interim Compensatory Measures for spent fuel storage safety. A study by MIT recommended reexamining safety systems, operating procedures, and emergency response plans for U.S. reactors. The Government Accountability Office suggested assessing existing storage facilities for long-term storage requirements. NRC dispatched inspectors to U.S. reactors and storage sites after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident. After the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, NRC inspected U.S. reactors and SNF storage sites. Most sites showed no significant vulnerabilities. Older SNF at some sites had minimal impact from extended power loss due to radioactive decay. Concerns about SNF storage risks were raised, but little damage was observed despite power and cooling water loss. Despite concerns about potential zirconium cladding fires in spent fuel storage pools, initial assessments at the Fukushima Dai-ichi site showed little to no damage to the fuel. The National Academies/National Research Council deemed the risk of such fires as unlikely, but additional mitigation measures have been implemented by the NRC to address the issue. Some critics argue that the large inventory of radioactive material in wet pools poses a significant risk if the fuel were to be uncovered and drained of water. The large inventory of radioactive material in wet pools poses a significant risk if the spent nuclear fuel pools were drained of water, uncovered, and there was a release from an incident such as a fire or deliberate attack. Concerns have been raised about the design of boiling water reactors (BWRs) like the GE Mark I, where the spent fuel storage pool is located inside the same containment structure as the reactor, potentially posing safety risks. In situations like the one at Fukushima, where off-site power is lost, the spent fuel pool may also lose power, affecting cooling and monitoring systems. The height of the spent fuel pools in many BWRs adds to the concerns. The elevated radiation near the reactor in Japan hindered personnel from mitigating problems or monitoring the SNF storage pools. The height of the SNF pools in many BWRs could pose safety risks due to access challenges and potential for coolant loss in a structural failure. After the 9/11 attacks, concerns about terrorist threats to spent nuclear fuel pools led to NRC issuing orders and conducting site-specific evaluations to review risks and readiness. The NRC issued confidential orders and letters to licensees for SNF storage facilities, resulting in incremental improvements like enhanced backup power supply reliability. Unlike Germany, the US did not mandate large-scale shifts to dry cask storage or hardened facilities. Germany has established hardened storage buildings and consolidated central SNF storage facilities due to risks, including potential attacks. Degradation of cladding and fuel elements poses a safety threat to SNF storage, with water chemistry in storage pools controlled to mitigate risks. The potential vulnerability of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) varies with the type of fuel rod used. U.S. light water reactor fuel rods have shown to be more durable than British Magnox fuel rods or DOE nuclear materials production reactor fuel elements. The NRC has stated that the cladding encasing SNF is highly resistant to failure under pool storage conditions, with no detectable degradation of zircalloy cladding observed in corrosion studies. However, long-term research projects have been recommended to evaluate the integrity of stored SNF. The NRC has concluded that dry cask storage provides additional confidence in long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) as long as proper procedures are followed to ensure dryness and inerting of the canister or cask. Monitoring of closure seals is actively conducted, and potential degradation mechanisms for cladding and fuel are being reevaluated for long-term storage. The NRC has identified releases of tritium-contaminated water to groundwater at various sites, including commercial and DOE sites. Tritium contamination was found in spent fuel storage pools at locations such as Brookhaven National Laboratory, Hanford, and Savannah River Site. Despite documented releases of radioactivity, there is no evidence of significant public exposures or health impacts. NRC established a Tritium Contamination Task Force in March 2010 to address this issue. The NRC has addressed concerns about contamination of groundwater from leaking spent nuclear fuel storage pools by establishing a Tritium Contamination Task Force. Despite documented releases of radioactivity, there is no evidence of significant public exposures or health impacts. NRC's Waste Confidence Rule aims to prevent site-by-site issues during reactor licensing proceedings. Litigation regarding this rule is ongoing. The NRC issued Waste Confidence Decisions in response to legal challenges, indicating that spent nuclear fuel could be safely stored until a permanent repository is available. The most recent revision removed a specific date for repository availability, instead stating that spent fuel can be stored safely for at least 60 years beyond a reactor's licensed operating life. The nuclear power industry is confident in the ability of existing dry cask storage technology to sustain storage for at least 100 years. The Waste Confidence Decisions by the NRC assure the safety of spent nuclear fuel storage, with no requirement to discuss environmental impacts beyond the reactor's operating license term. The states of New York, Vermont, and Connecticut petitioned to challenge NRC's rule on nuclear power reactor operating licenses. NRC plans to update the Waste Confidence Rule in 2019 after an Environmental Impact Statement. Resources have been shifted to evaluate extended long-term storage of radioactive material. NRC is addressing safety concerns related to extended spent nuclear fuel storage after the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program. U.S. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko is confident in addressing policy issues, including regulating interim and extended spent fuel storage. The NRC is conducting a comprehensive review of the regulatory framework for interim and extended spent fuel storage. This effort aims to improve current licensing, inspection, and enforcement programs, enhance technical and regulatory basis for storage and transportation, and identify long-term policy changes for safe storage and transportation. The Commission is not endorsing indefinite onsite storage and is planning for storage until approximately 2250. The FY2012 budget request did not include funding for Yucca Mountain repository operations or licensing. The FY2012 budget did not include funding for Yucca Mountain repository operations or licensing. The Administration's FY2013 request also lacks funding for the Yucca Mountain repository, proposing general repository studies instead. The House Appropriations Committee has suggested funding for NRC and DOE for Yucca Mountain activities. Recent budget shifts at DOE and NRC will be analyzed for years to come, especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, prompting a reexamination of spent nuclear fuel storage options. The NRC established a task force to examine regulatory requirements in light of the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident. The task force delivered recommendations for SNF storage safety, focusing on backup power and monitoring capabilities. The overall assessment is that U.S. plants remain safe, with likely recommendations for enhancing safety and preparedness. Options for SNF storage are being considered. The Task Force review on safety and emergency planning of U.S. plants is likely to recommend actions to enhance safety and preparedness, including options for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage. The basis for determining reasonable options for SNF storage depends on assumptions and policy choices, especially the timeline for a permanent geologic repository. Uncertainty about the disposal repository's opening date emphasizes the need for long-term SNF storage, without making projections about the repository's future. The report emphasizes the need for long-term SNF storage without projecting the timing or path forward for the proposed repository. Factors like SNF generation, new reactor starts, climate change, and technical developments could impact storage options. Dry cask storage is generally considered safer than wet storage pools, but debates exist on the level of safety provided by each option and the cost-effectiveness of dry casks. Questions also arise about the safety of both technologies during extended storage periods and unforeseen events. Dry cask storage is safer than wet storage pools and provides adequate shielding and cooling for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) discharged from reactors. Dry cask storage also includes preparation for transportation to a repository or consolidated storage facility. However, there are lingering uncertainties about the approval for this storage method and its linkage to final disposal in a geologic repository. The challenges of managing SNF storage using dry casks include uncertainties about approval for transportation canisters. The TAD program aimed to develop canisters for safe transport and disposal of spent fuel assemblies. NRC may require further review for new fuels with different characteristics. Some express concern about the safety of wet pool storage of SNF, but utilities continue to use it due to perceived safety and cost considerations. Operators prioritize maximizing existing wet storage pool capacity before investing in dry cask storage. Moving SNF to dry casks only when necessary is common practice to avoid unnecessary costs. The decision to shift to dry cask storage should be based on cost justifications and grid dispatch competition. Some argue for the immediate shift to dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel due to concerns about the safety of wet storage pools, especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster. Wet storage relies on active systems and poses risks if power is lost. The decision to transition to dry cask storage should be based on cost-effectiveness and safety considerations. The NRC believes both spent fuel pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for SNF storage. Dry cask storage is considered safer by some due to potential safety and security advantages over pool storage, as highlighted in a post-9/11 assessment by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council. The NAS recommended earlier transfer of spent fuel from pools to cask storage to reduce consequences of terrorist attacks. NRC believes both wet pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for public health and safety. There is no urgent need to mandate earlier fuel transfer. The NRC believes both wet pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for public health and safety. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko compared the safety of dry cask storage to wet pool storage, stating they have equal risk. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board concluded that spent fuel can be safely stored in dry casks for short-term storage. The debate between wet pool storage and dry casks continues. The debate over wet pool storage versus dry casks for spent nuclear fuel continues, with arguments on both sides regarding safety risks. The Fukushima Dai-ichi plant incident highlighted the resilience of dry casks compared to wet storage pools during disasters. Despite significant damage to wet storage pools due to hydrogen explosions, some believe the risks of moving fuel to dry casks outweigh the safety benefits. The structural collapse in the pools, worsened by power loss and lack of monitoring, did not significantly harm the spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Debate continues on whether SNF should be moved from wet storage to dry casks for safety reasons, but the NRC has determined that such a transfer is not necessary for adequate safety. Additional monitoring and safeguards have been ordered to mitigate risks, potentially increasing the cost of maintaining wet pool storage. The cost of maintaining wet pool storage for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) may increase due to additional monitoring and safeguards against blackout and loss-of-power situations. This could lead to a higher rate of transfer from wet pools to dry storage, potentially tripling the amount of SNF in dry cask storage. The NRC currently does not see a pressing safety or security need to mandate earlier transfer of fuel from pool to cask, but modifications may be needed for a larger number of sites due to the increasing use of dry cask storage. The NRC's process for inspecting the safety and security of dry cask storage is under review by the NRC Office of Inspector General. While no current technical risks were identified, the review highlighted the need for a more centralized system for inspections, staffing, and training. With dry cask storage expected to be the primary method for SNF storage by 2025, NRC must enhance staffing, training, and procedural discipline for effective and consistent inspections. Recommendations were made for adjustments in NRC management to improve oversight and inspections. The NRC's recent improvements in the dry cask inspection program did not mandate a switch from wet to dry storage. Instead, recommendations focused on enhancing spent fuel pool capabilities and addressing site blackout mitigation. The commission staff found no imminent risk from current operations but recommended action on certain task force recommendations, such as establishing a 72-hour coping time for core and spent fuel pool cooling. Further review is needed for other task force recommendations related to SNF management. The need for additional review is recommended for task force recommendations related to SNF management, including seismic qualification and instrumentation requirements. Options for SNF storage range from decentralized to consolidated or centralized facilities due to concerns about costs and safety. Long-term interim storage is suggested to ease pressure on establishing a repository. The most debated option is centralized storage for stranded SNF, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission. Evaluation of storage options starts with the current situation and existing SNF locations. The current U.S. inventory of SNF is over 67,000 MTU and growing by about 2,000 MTU annually. Future inventory levels depend on reactor operations, license renewals, and new construction. A 1995 DOE study projected SNF storage to reach around 86,000 MTU by 2030. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham mentioned security concerns post-9/11 as a reason for relocating high-level waste to Nevada. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham cited security concerns post-9/11 as a reason for relocating high-level waste to Nevada. The BRC draft report highlighted the need for at-reactor storage of spent fuel for one to five years before transfer to dry cask storage. The report also recommended modifying the NWPA to allow for multiple storage facilities with adequate capacity. The BRC recommended modifying the NWPA to allow for multiple storage facilities with adequate capacity to be sited, licensed, and constructed when needed. This recommendation aligns with the benefits of centralized interim storage, as highlighted in a report by MIT, suggesting a move towards centralized storage sites for spent nuclear fuel. A nuclear analyst from Harvard University urged BRC to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. Senators proposed legislation for up to two interim storage sites, with provisions for DOE to pay local governments and arrange transportation. Consolidated interim storage has been debated for years, with concerns about reducing pressure for a permanent repository. Consolidated interim storage of spent nuclear fuel has been debated for years. Concerns include reducing pressure for a permanent repository, protracted delays in finding host communities, and potentially higher risks from multiple moves. Common ground exists on the need to consolidate storage at \"stranded\" sites to reduce overhead costs and improve security. Consolidating spent nuclear fuel storage sites can reduce overhead costs and improve security by potentially adding new storage sites, reducing the need for wet storage, and minimizing the number of sites requiring security measures. However, there may be incremental risks associated with transporting the fuel to a consolidated site. The United States has experience in safely transporting spent nuclear fuel (SNF) through various programs. Alternative management and regulatory oversight structures are being considered, including government and quasi-governmental entities. Congress has assigned three federal agencies with responsibilities for high-level nuclear waste management, including SNF. The United States is exploring alternative management structures for high-level nuclear waste, including spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Responsibilities for SNF management have shifted from the DOE to the Office of Nuclear Energy. Proposed models include the establishment of a government corporation with bipartisan oversight. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommends the creation of a new organization for a focused waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) recommended creating a new federal corporation dedicated to implementing a focused nuclear waste management program in the United States. Some critics felt this fell short of their goal for a market-based private management system. Suggestions included using existing DOE nuclear weapons facilities for storage and investing in new reprocessing technologies. The DOE nuclear weapons facilities are being considered for storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and research on new reprocessing technologies. The debate includes the idea of establishing a consolidated storage facility for commercial SNF at a DOE site, such as the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Reprocessing, or chemical separations, is a long-standing issue separate from storage location, with some advocating for it as a solution while others argue it is not cost-effective and poses environmental and nonproliferation risks. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been deemed not cost-effective and poses environmental and nonproliferation risks. Studies suggest that reprocessing cannot be justified based on waste management or economic advantages, but support further research for more cost-effective technologies. Advocates for reprocessing recommend government-funded research for new technologies, as current options do not offer significant benefits. The conclusion that spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is not currently viable as a cost-effective alternative to storage and disposal does not mean that viable processing technology could not be developed in the future. Concerns about proliferation policy impacts led to a halt in reprocessing by President Gerald Ford in the 1970s, and there are currently no plans for commercial reprocessing due to lack of commercial viability. Proponents argue that new technologies could address waste and proliferation risks associated with traditional reprocessing methods. The Obama Administration has funded research into new spent nuclear fuel processing technologies to address waste and proliferation risks. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended increased federal funding for the NRC to develop a regulatory framework for advanced nuclear energy systems. The nuclear industry believes NRC rulemaking is necessary to determine the cost of new technologies. The nuclear industry has indicated the need for NRC rulemaking to establish a licensing process for SNF reprocessing. Some critics question the necessity of rulemaking due to the lack of reprocessing proposals. SNF is mainly stored at reactors using dry casks when storage pool capacity is full. Long-term or extended SNF storage is likely due to limited repository capacity. Concerns about wet pool storage safety exist, but regulatory controls and economic incentives are believed to ensure safe storage. Dry cask systems are preferred for SNF storage, with growth expected to continue. The growth in SNF storage has been mainly with dry cask systems, which are expected to continue increasing compared to wet pools. This trend is driven by cost advantages and a longer storage time horizon. The current SNF storage situation could change if Congress adopts recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, addressing storage locations and management structures. Uncertainties include the success of siting a centralized storage site, the establishment of a new agency for SNF management, and the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The Senate Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2013 includes provisions to fund efforts to adopt the BRC recommendations. The Senate committee included language authorizing a pilot program for consolidated interim storage facilities for SNF and high-level waste, requiring consent from state governors, local governments, tribes, and Congress. DOE is directed to use funding for the program and submit a Pilot Program Plan within 120 days. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is developing legislation to address BRC recommendations, while the House bill provides funding for Yucca Mountain disposal activities."
