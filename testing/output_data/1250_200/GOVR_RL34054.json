    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. This decision was based on the need for robust communication capabilities. The FCC endorsed a public-private partnership to create a nationwide broadband network for public safety by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. This collaboration aims to provide robust communication capabilities and interoperability. The FCC designated 10 MHz of commercial spectrum to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz for a shared network. The D Block license, intended for commercial use, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, Qualcomm, Inc., but failed to meet the reserve price of $1.3 billion. The FCC decided not to proceed with a re-auction, initiating a review of its rules and seeking comments on options for disposing of the D Block. The FCC prepared a notice of proposed rule-making for the D Block, seeking comments on disposal options. A Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking introduced new auction rules, maintaining a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Public safety associations requested local networks to operate on the spectrum. The FCC aims to combine public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The discussions focus on combining public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for this, without incorporating each other's goals. Congress is considering funding solutions, with options including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The federal government could temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. The federal government could preserve the principle of the shared network, assure network construction, and sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users benefits public safety by providing funding, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The report assumes three needs for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum, a source of funds, and unavoidable costs for a national public safety license. A source of funds must be identified to cover costs related to the creation of a national public safety license, including rebanding and spectrum license administration. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. Incentives are needed for commercial partners to build a network meeting public safety standards, despite the demand for mobile data access and security in the business sector. The debate surrounding the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on modifying auction rules to attract potential bidders while maintaining the public-private partnership structure for a public safety broadband network. Various reasons for the lack of winning bids have been circulated, with a focus on addressing flaws in the auction structure and rules that may have deterred bidders. The goal is to ensure a secure and reliable mobile data access network for both the business sector and public safety. The course of action proposed involves changing auction rules to attract bidders for the D Block license without altering the public-private partnership structure. It suggests eliminating network sharing requirements and allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships. The plan also involves using federal funds to build a public safety network, potentially from proceeds of the 700 MHz frequencies auction. Congressional action is required to authorize expenditures and a different organizational structure for managing the network is recommended. The FCC seeks comments on various options for a public safety network, including re-auctioning the D Block under new rules. Commissioners support finding a commercial partner for public safety and increasing FCC oversight. Rule changes could involve modifying requirements for the winning bidder or adjusting the network sharing agreement. Some proposals suggest re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, such as eliminating the network sharing agreement and offering it as a commercial license. There are recommendations to use surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin mentioned the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act as a potential solution. Some proposals recommend re-auctioning the D Block without restrictions and offering it as a commercial license. Suggestions include using surplus auction funds to establish a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin cited the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act as a possible funding mechanism for public safety communications. The proposal suggests creating a cooperative organization with multiple public safety and commercial partners to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for emergency communication. The commercial partner would require a smaller financial commitment while state and local agencies would have more involvement in building and controlling access to their parts of the network. Funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs. Multiple commercial partners could be involved with licenses for local markets and rural coverage. Public safety would lead in designing the network and choosing technology and standards. The proposal suggests creating a cooperative organization with public safety and commercial partners to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for emergency communication. The FCC could set standards for the network, with federal funds administered through the Department of Homeland Security. A federally chartered corporation could ensure broad-based participation of public safety agencies. A federally chartered corporation could be established to operate a new public safety network at 700 MHz, funded through appropriations or fundraising. The Public Safety Broadband License could be retained by the current holder or reassigned. Congressional oversight would replace FCC regulatory roles. The FCC could work with Congress to create a broadband network for public safety using existing licenses and spectrum bands. The FCC seeks opinions and information on various topics related to the Public Safety Broadband License, network sharing agreements, auction rules, and spectrum band plans. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust proposed borrowing $197 million for capital expenditures to build a network for public safety. The FCC is also considering obligations of the D Block in building the shared network. The FCC is seeking opinions on funding sources for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. These funds would need Congressional approval for use. The Telecommunications Development Fund provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through various means. The FCC provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through loans or investments, primarily funded by interest on deposits from spectrum auctions. The FCC establishes auction rules, financial requirements for bidders, and service rules for license use. For Auction 73, the FCC introduced spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial license holders. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial license holders in the 700 MHz band. This involved creating a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership to address potential network operation issues. The framework includes binding requirements for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the commercial partner, and the Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC mandated spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial license holders in the 700 MHz band. This involved creating a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership, including requirements for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the commercial partner, and the Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety use as part of the transition to digital television. The 700 MHz band was allocated for public safety use during the transition to digital television. The band plan was revised to include two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. The FCC worked with NPSTC to make changes reflecting technology advancements and public safety needs. The revised band plan designates frequencies for narrowband and broadband applications. Narrowband operations will use 12 MHz of paired spectrum at 769 - 775 MHz and 799 - 805 MHz, administered by states and localities. Networks on narrowband frequencies will be funded by a combination of local, state, and federal funds. Broadband communications will use 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz, assigned to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz will prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan. Some public safety network operators will need to modify equipment for the new band plan to prevent interference. The cost of changes may be covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will be responsible for forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and participating in the Network Sharing Agreement. The national network's construction costs will be covered by the commercial partner, with potential public sector funding for enhancements. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed by public safety associations to receive the public safety license. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License with representation from public safety organizations on the Board of Directors. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members and allowed for at-large members, creating a board of 13 members. Later, the FCC changed the board composition, adding three representatives, eliminating one, and increasing at-large members to four. At-large members were selected jointly by FCC bureaus. The FCC increased the number of at-large members on the board to four, selected jointly by FCC bureaus. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council was removed as a named member due to membership overlap. PSST, as the selected licensee, would need to file quarterly financial reports with the FCC. The FCC would provide oversight to ensure corporate governance criteria are met for the public safety license holder. Various options were considered to ensure robust emergency communications services. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the public safety license if obligations are not met. The public safety license is valid for ten years and renewable, with additional tasks set by the FCC. Responsibilities include negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with the commercial partner. The licensee for the public safety network must negotiate agreements with commercial partners, administer network access for public safety users, represent user interests, approve equipment and applications, coordinate frequency access, oversee user relocations, and decide on federal agency access. The FCC oversees the relocation of users due to rebanding in the 700 MHz band and decides on federal agency access to the broadband network. It reviews requests for wideband networks in unserved areas and facilitates negotiations for network sites on public land. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz. Eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 could receive bidding credits based on FCC rules for small businesses. In Auction 73, the FCC set a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block, which includes frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz. The winning bidder had to meet specific requirements, such as completing a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee within six months of filing the long form application. The FCC required the completion of a Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) within six months of winning the D Block license at Auction 73. The agreement included provisions for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to have right of first refusal for network asset sales and the option to purchase assets at fair market value if the D Block license is cancelled. Negotiations had to begin within ten days of winning the bid, with monthly progress reports required after three months. FCC staff would observe negotiations, and separate legal entities had to be formed to hold the D Block license. The FCC required the formation of separate legal entities to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the network. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and approved by the FCC. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would consist of quasi-independent companies with designated functions, subject to the Communications Act. The FCC mandated the formation of separate legal entities with designated functions to hold the D Block license and operate the network. These entities must comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations. Failure to meet obligations could result in license revocation and penalties. The D Block license is valid for ten years, with the possibility of renewal if FCC rules are followed. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build out of the public safety network using spectrum held by the D Block license holder. The network must reach 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. Population measurements are based on U.S. Census data, and the build-out schedule includes major highways and interstates. The FCC required the D Block licensee to meet coverage standards for major highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 population. Benchmarks had to be confirmed to the FCC, failure could lead to license cancellation. A satellite solution for public safety in rural areas was mandated. Signal robustness and network performance requirements were set by the NSA. Service to public safety users had to be maintained without degradation unless requested by the network. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to meet coverage standards for highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 population. Benchmarks must be confirmed to the FCC, failure could lead to license cancellation. A satellite solution for public safety in rural areas is mandated. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is the keystone of the public-private partnership, with rules serving as the contractual mortar uniting the two licensees. The FCC reviews and approves all components of the NSA, setting various requirements such as network coverage standards. Minimum standards for the network are included in the Second Report and Order to ensure it meets the needs of public safety.

Benchmarks must be confirmed to the FCC, failure could lead to license cancellation. A satellite solution for public safety in rural areas is mandated. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is the keystone of the public-private partnership, with rules serving as the contractual mortar uniting the two licensees. The FCC reviews and approves all components of the NSA, setting various requirements such as network coverage standards. Minimum standards for the network are included in the Second Report and Order to ensure it meets the needs of public safety. Specifications for a platform that provides broadband mobile voice, video, and data and includes current and evolving technologies that have features for public safety users, as well as commercial uses. Specifications that assure communications interoperability across agencies, jurisdictions, and geographic areas. Sufficient signal coverage to meet public safety standards, such as service reliability of 99.7% or better. Sufficient robustness to meet reliability and performance standards of public safety, including features such as hardening of transmission facilities and antenna towers to withstand harsh weather and disaster conditions and back-up power to maintain operations for \"an extended period of time.\" Sufficient capacity to meet the needs of public safety during emergency situations and periods of heavy usage without degrading service, for example by blocking calls or slowing transmissions. The FCC's expectation is that the network would use spectrum efficient technologies to achieve this. State-of-the-art security and encryption technologies. Automatic prioritization of public safety communications over commercial uses in real time, and prioritization of public safety communications by type, with the highest. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the network to ensure public safety requirements are met. They have the right to determine equipment specifications and purchase their own subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide integrated handsets for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. FCC guidelines and obligations are stipulated in rule making. The FCC rules require public safety users to follow guidelines for the Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and duration. Fees must be specified, including those for normal network service and priority access during emergencies. Negotiations should be done in good faith, with reasonable rates set to protect public safety participants. Pricing should be affordable and in line with commercial services, with financial incentives for commercial licensees based on the number of public safety subscribers. The FCC rules require public safety users to follow guidelines for the Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and duration. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to negotiate fees with its public safety partner in line with public safety goals. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) would be in effect for a term not to exceed ten years, corresponding to the duration of the D Block license, and may be renewed or modified with FCC approval. The FCC requires approval from Commissioners or Chiefs for major changes. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease frequencies to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. The D Block network can only transmit on public safety frequencies when not in use by public safety users. This arrangement is part of a public-private partnership agreement. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the D Block licensee to build a network for public safety use. The D Block licensee must ensure no interference with public safety users and give them priority access in emergencies. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to provide priority access to public safety users in emergencies. The definition of an emergency is part of the NSA, and the public safety licensee can appeal to the FCC if an agreement cannot be reached. The FCC also revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band and resolved spectrum management issues. The D Block licensee is responsible for covering the costs of technical adjustments, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to cover costs for technical adjustments to equipment and software, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million. New operations of narrowband systems on 700 MHz public safety networks are prohibited due to rebanding. The new band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band includes two sets of paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband networks. Some states have started building narrowband networks on the 700 MHz capacity, but frequencies need to be vacated by February 17, 2009, for the broadband network. The FCC mandated that frequencies in the 700 MHz band be vacated for broadband use by February 17, 2009. Motorola estimated the cost of rebanding at $9.45 million, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million set by the FCC. Only systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, would be covered to control costs, estimated to be around $6 million. The FCC set a $10 million cap for rebanding costs, with estimated expenses around $6 million. To control costs, new operations on affected frequencies were prohibited after August 30, 2007. Public safety and commercial licensees had to reach agreements on relocation plans and costs within 30 days to receive reimbursement. The FCC set a $10 million cap for rebanding costs, with estimated expenses around $6 million. The D Block licensee would be responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables. The rule making does acknowledge the possibility of reimbursement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs related to the rebanding program, not to exceed $10 million. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs for rebanding, not to exceed $10 million. The agreed amount must be submitted to the FCC as part of the relocation plan, and paid into a trust account by the public safety licensee. Payments can only be made after the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. Public safety network operators need a waiver to operate wideband systems. The FCC requires public safety network operators to obtain a waiver to operate wideband systems, with specific requirements for the waiver request. Wideband operations must be within narrowband frequencies, devices must be interoperable with the broadband network, and licenses are valid for five years. The FCC has positioned itself as the protector of public safety interests and nationwide emergency communications under the Communications Act. The FCC, as the protector of public safety interests and nationwide emergency communications under the Communications Act, would regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and oversee the public-private partnership. The FCC plans to enforce existing rules or create new rules as needed in the future for the network valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The FCC plans to enforce rules for the public-private partnership, including litigation or license revocation. Congress would guide FCC commissioners. Two bills in the 110th Congress address issues in creating a shared network, providing funding for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and promoting a nationwide communications network. The bills impose limits on the licensee's activities. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 aims to create a trust fund for purchasing interoperable radios for a new public safety network. The network plan is tied to the auction of the D Block spectrum, with proceeds going into the Trust Fund. The Act also extends auction authority for the FCC to ensure revenue-producing auctions continue."
