Other major programs aiding lower-income households in 2009 included Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, SSI, and EITC payments. The Administration's FY2011 budget request envisions continued growth in federal spending on food assistance, particularly the SNAP program. SNAP participation and monthly spending on benefits increased significantly from 2008 to 2009. The program provides low-income households with monthly benefits to supplement their food spending. In FY2010, total SNAP spending is estimated to be at least $69 billion with almost 41 million participants, up from $53.8 billion and 33.7 million participants in FY2009. TEFAP provides food commodities to emergency feeding organizations and cash payments for distribution costs. Feeding America reported a 21% increase in food distribution between June 2008 and June 2009. TEFAP provided $710 million worth of commodities and $89 million in distribution cost assistance in FY2009, up from $420 million in FY2008. Support for TEFAP may decrease in FY2010 due to the expiration of extra funding. In FY2009, TEFAP provided $710 million worth of commodities and $89 million in distribution cost assistance, up from $420 million in FY2008. Support for TEFAP may decrease in FY2010 without additional funding. Child nutrition programs saw an increase in participation, with school meal programs costing $15.4 billion in FY2009 and estimated to rise to $17 billion in FY2010. The Administration estimates that child nutrition spending will increase to $17 billion in FY2010, with a projected rise in the number of children receiving free school meals. The WIC program provides nutrition assistance to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children, with costs totaling $6.5 billion in FY2009. Participation in WIC increased by 2.3% in November 2009, reaching 9.1 million individuals. The USDA's report in 2008 estimated that 14.6% of American households were \"food insecure.\" The report \"Household Food Security in the United States, 2008\" estimated that 14.6% of American households were food insecure in 2008, with 5.7% experiencing very low food security. Prevalence rates of food insecurity were the highest since 1995. In 2008, food hardship for the nation rose from 16.3% to 19.5%, dropping slightly in 2009. In 2008, food hardship for American households rose from 16.3% to 19.5%, dropping slightly in 2009. Congress and the Administration made changes to SNAP funding, benefits, and eligibility in response to the economic downturn. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions expanding SNAP benefits and eligibility, with estimated costs of $10.8 billion in the first two years. SNAP benefits were increased, eligibility time limits were suspended, and states received extra federal funding for administrative costs. In response to the economic downturn, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded SNAP benefits and eligibility. This included suspending time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents and providing extra federal funding for administrative costs. Monthly SNAP allotments are based on the cost of a minimally adequate diet, with benefits increased by 13.6% through raising the base Thrifty Food Plan amounts. This resulted in a nearly 20% increase in average household benefits. In FY2009, ARRA-provided SNAP benefits totaled $4.3 billion, accounting for 15% of all benefit costs. By November 2009, ARRA-provided benefits reached over $800 million, making up 16% of benefit costs. The ARRA suspended time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents who couldn't find a job through FY2010. States share approximately half of SNAP administrative costs, amounting to around $3 billion annually. In FY2009, ARRA provided $4.3 billion in SNAP benefits, accounting for 15% of all benefit costs. By November 2009, ARRA benefits reached over $800 million, making up 16% of costs. States share around $3 billion annually in SNAP administrative costs. The federal government allocated additional funds for administrative expenses in FY2009 and FY2010, with a $5 billion increase in FY2010 spending. The Defense Department also provided extra funding for emergency SNAP requirements and state administrative expenses. The Administration has taken steps to expand access to the SNAP by encouraging states to use \"categorical eligibility\" authority to increase household eligibility. This includes lifting limits on assets and raising income limits. Additionally, waivers have been granted for face-to-face interviews for initial eligibility and recertification in many states. In FY2009, TEFAP was budgeted at $250 million in commodities and $50 million for distribution/storage costs, with an additional $150 million made available through FY2010. The ARRA also allocated $6 million for infrastructure improvement expenses for TEFAP recipient organizations. Child nutrition programs received $100 million for school food service equipment grants. The FY2010 Agriculture Department appropriations law (P.L. 111-80) allocated $25 million for grants to improve direct certification rates for free school meals and federal technical assistance. $400 million was provided in the ARRA for a contingency reserve to support WIC funding needs. The ARRA provides funding for WIC state agencies' management information system expansions/upgrades and a contingency reserve for food costs. The FY2011 budget requests substantial increases in participation and spending for USDA food assistance programs, with SNAP costs projected to rise by almost $4 billion due to increased participation. Child nutrition and WIC program spending is also expected to increase, while TEFAP funding is set for a slight decrease. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposes changes to domestic food assistance programs, including extending SNAP funding authority and suspending eligibility rules for ABAWDs. It also suggests excluding tax credits as countable assets and increasing the asset limit to $10,000. Additionally, it plans to add $1 billion in new spending over 10 years. The FY2011 budget proposes adding $1 billion in new spending authority for child nutrition programs to end childhood hunger by 2015, focusing on reducing obesity and improving children's diets."
