    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, job numbers fell the following month. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, was most affected by job losses. Service-providing industries like education and health services continued to add workers, but overall job losses outweighed gains. The financial activities industry also experienced job losses before the economic downturn. The financial activities industry, like construction, suffered job losses due to the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, history shows job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months after previous recessions, but in some cases, it took up to 22 months for steady job growth to begin. The financial activities industry, like construction, suffered job losses due to the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, history shows job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months after previous recessions, but in some cases, it took up to 22 months for steady job growth to begin. In response to a recession, Congress has often directed funds to infrastructure activities to create jobs. Public works historically involved heavy construction, but now includes green economic activities. Green jobs are related to industries using renewable resources or producing energy-efficient goods. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, with a focus on job creation estimates and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide and by state. Researchers encounter difficulties in estimating the number of jobs supported by expenditures on green economic activities. Interest in job creation from economic activities arises during economic downturns and when policymakers compare stimulus options or shift expenditures. The number of jobs remains unchanged without increased total spending. An input-output model is often used to estimate job creation, showing how sales value is distributed across industries. This model reflects the interrelationships between industries in the production process. An input-output table shows the dollar value of products produced by different industries and their employment requirements. Employment requirements are based on productivity estimates and include direct and indirect jobs supported by economic activity. It is expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures. An employment requirements table is similar to an I-O table, displaying the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars in each industry. A matrix showing job support for different industries based on one billion dollars expenditure. It estimates the impact of spending on various industries and the job creation potential. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity at a specific time, affecting job generation. Estimates are often in terms of jobs created per billion dollars spent, but the actual impact may vary due to technological advancements. The impact of expenditures on job creation can vary due to changes in price levels over time and differences between estimated and actual job creation. Input-output models assume unlimited resources, which can lead to discrepancies in job creation estimates. Additionally, the domestic employment impact may be overstated if inputs are imported, and employment is not differentiated between full-time and part-time jobs in I-O tables. The number of jobs created by economic activities includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Induced jobs depend on spending by those employed directly or indirectly. Estimating induced jobs or the multiplier effect is challenging due to uncertainties in spending behavior. The multiplier effect in job creation depends on how much additional money earned by workers is spent versus saved. Estimates vary widely, with different studies using different multipliers. The Federal Highway Administration's analysis shows that $1 billion in federal-aid highway expenditures plus a $250 million state match supported 47,575 jobs in 1997, and 34,779 jobs in 2007 with a $1.25 billion expenditure on highway construction. The construction project funded by $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from the state could support 34,779 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that $1 billion in federal spending on highways supports 27,800 jobs, with jobs in construction-oriented, supporting industries, and induced jobs. Induced jobs make up half of the total estimate. The Federal Highway Administration notes that induced jobs account for half of the total estimate in construction projects. They mention that specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. Additionally, they highlight that highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project outlaying in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics offers employment requirements tables based on national I-O tables developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. These tables are updated to reflect current production and distribution technologies and labor productivity. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions according to the North American Industry Classification System. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion of construction spending, with the majority in the industry itself. Discrepancies in job figures for construction expenditures may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, and time period. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion of construction spending, with the majority in the industry itself. Discrepancies in job figures for construction expenditures may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, method of updating the model, and time period. The employment requirements available from BLS do not break out other types of construction that have been discussed as part of a federal job creation package. BLS formerly conducted surveys to estimate full-time year-long employment associated with various construction activities, but the survey information was last updated a few decades ago. BEA produces estimates by geographic area of the employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in different industries. The number of jobs directly and indirectly supported by an expenditure of $1 billion in the construction industry in a given state varies widely. The number of jobs supported by a $1 billion expenditure in the construction industry varies by state due to different industry mixes and earnings. Estimating jobs from green infrastructure activities is challenging as current data collection methods do not identify green industries separately. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not distinguish renewable energy sources like wind and solar in its categories. The electric utility industry is divided into different types of power generation, transmission, and distribution. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are not specifically categorized. The conventional input-output model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs created by green activities due to different input requirements. The construction industry lacks a unique category for retrofitting, making it challenging to use conventional models for estimating job creation in green activities. This difficulty is often not addressed in analyses of green job creation. The analysis of green job creation often overlooks the issue of how certain industries are categorized, leading to challenges in estimating job creation accurately. Researchers have had to create synthetic industries by combining existing data to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, and building retrofitting. This complicates employment projections, as studies use different assumptions and timeframes for estimating future green jobs. The analysis of green job creation is complex due to differing assumptions and methodologies used in estimating future jobs, especially in relation to specific states. The lack of clear articulation of assumptions makes it challenging to review results from studies by green economy proponents. Job creation estimates may not be applicable to all areas due to varying state economies and industry mixes. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, proposes a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" to create almost 2 million jobs through federal spending on activities like public building retrofits and mass transit expansion. The Apollo Alliance proposed The Apollo Economic Recovery Act in December 2008, aiming to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a $500 billion program. The initiative calls for $50 billion in federal spending to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs, with a focus on activities like public building retrofits and mass transit expansion. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid, $8 billion for road and bridge repairs, and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles. Congress emphasized timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, requiring entities to report estimates of jobs created from ARRA appropriations. Entities receiving ARRA appropriations must report estimates of direct jobs created and retained from infrastructure projects to federal agencies. Recipients made their first submission in October 2009, with agencies required to post reports online 30 days after each quarter. OMB provided guidance for job estimates, with CBO and GAO reviewing job estimates within 45 days. As of September 30, 2009, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained. OMB revised guidance in June 2009 due to concerns about saved jobs. In response to feedback, OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved under ARRA, defining them as existing positions that would not have been filled without Recovery Act funding. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded in Q4 2009 and 682,370 in Q1 2010. The CEA was tasked with reporting on ARRA's impact on employment and economic indicators. The CEA's mandate extends beyond reporting requirements for $271 billion in direct government investment spending out of $787 billion in ARRA. The first quarterly report found that ARRA may have added one million jobs in August 2009. CBO provided a broader estimate of jobs created or saved, comparable to the CEA's estimate. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases created between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs by September 2009. The CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs in August 2009 aligns with CBO's range. In January 2010, the CEA reported that ARRA may have raised year-end employment by 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs. By the fourth quarter of 2009, CBO suggested that ARRA's policies could have increased employment by 1.0\u20132.1 million. In April 2010, the CEA estimated that ARRA raised employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs through March 2010. The CEA's third quarterly report in April 2010 estimated that ARRA might have raised employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs through March 2010. The CBO also estimated that ARRA's policies could have increased employment by 1.2\u20132.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. The fourth quarterly ARRA jobs report by the CEA in July 2010 suggested that ARRA might have increased employment by 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs. Public investment outlays under ARRA, including clean energy, education, transportation, healthcare, and construction, may have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs. Public investment outlays under ARRA, including various sectors like air, sea, highway, transit, health care delivery, technology, and building construction, may have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010, and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of the year."
