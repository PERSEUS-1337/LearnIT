    "content": "The \"Structured Settlement Protection Act\" imposes an excise tax on individuals acquiring structured settlement payments in factoring transactions. This Act adds a new chapter to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding structured settlement factoring transactions. The \"Structured Settlement Protection Act\" imposes a 50 percent tax on acquiring structured settlement payment rights in factoring transactions, with exceptions for court-approved hardships. The definition of a 'settlement' includes an arrangement for periodic payments of damages or compensation that are excludable from gross income, and must meet specific criteria outlined in the law. Structured settlement payment rights refer to the rights to receive payments under a structured settlement. A structured settlement factoring transaction involves the transfer of these payment rights for consideration through sale, assignment, pledge, or other forms of encumbrance. The factoring discount is the difference between the total amount of structured settlement payments being acquired and the actual amount paid by the acquirer. The term 'relevant court or administrative authority' in structured settlement transactions refers to the court or administrative body with jurisdiction over the underlying action or claim. This ensures coordination with other provisions in cases involving structured settlement payment rights. The IRS regulations ensure that structured settlement factoring transactions do not affect the tax treatment of parties involved. The Secretary is authorized to create necessary regulations for clarifying the treatment of amounts received by the structured settlement recipient. Additionally, a new section on information reporting is added to the relevant part of the tax code. The IRS regulations require reporting on structured settlement factoring transactions. The IRS regulations mandate reporting on structured settlement factoring transactions, specifying that the person making the structured settlement payments must provide returns and written statements to the acquirer of the structured settlement payment rights as outlined in section 6041, or as directed by the Secretary through regulations. The section outlines reporting obligations for structured settlement payments in the event of a factoring transaction. Withholding provisions do not apply in this scenario. The definition of 'acquirer of the structured settlement payment rights' includes persons described in section 7701(a)(1). Clerical amendments are made to the table of chapters for subtitle E of the Code. Chapter 55 introduces reporting requirements for structured settlement factoring transactions under section 6050T of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments apply to transactions occurring after the enactment of the Act."
