Congress acknowledges the importance of a single, open, global Internet for the free flow of information and products. Policies should encourage global technology standards, respect user security and privacy, promote innovation, avoid restricting information flow, and support trade in Internet-related goods and services. Certain governments and international bodies are adopting policies contrary to a free, open Internet, including mandating unique technology standards, sponsoring unauthorized access to networks, blocking Internet communications, and monitoring Internet use. Certain governments and international bodies are adopting policies against Internet-based services and content from other countries, monitoring Internet use in a way that restricts privacy and freedom, and imposing market access requirements that discriminate against foreign Internet-related goods and services. These actions threaten the interests of the United States by facilitating foreign governments' attempts to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet, promoting conflicting \"national Internets,\" and harming US workers and businesses. The curr_chunk highlights the negative impacts of certain policies on the United States, including harming US workers and businesses, undermining the industrial base, and risking the utility of the Internet for communication and commerce. The curr_chunk establishes the creation of a Task Force on the Global Internet. The Task Force on the Global Internet is established within the executive branch, hosted by the Department of Commerce. The Task Force consists of four individuals with expertise in Internet policy and civil liberties, nominated by the public and appointed by the President, and the leader of the majority party in the Senate. The Task Force on the Global Internet, established within the executive branch and hosted by the Department of Commerce, consists of individuals with expertise in Internet policy and civil liberties.
