    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic decline and job losses. In response, the government took control of the GSEs through conservatorship and provided financial support. The Obama Administration committed $400 billion to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with taxpayers owning at least 80% of the GSEs. The use of Federal funds to cover losses was unlimited, totaling over $110 billion. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now considered government entities, impacting Federal housing policy and reducing the likelihood of returning to private ownership. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and the FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for the chief executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with other top executives, which included cash payments instead of stock options. FHFA determined no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac entitled to cash bonus or long-term incentive awards for 2008. Strategic Plan includes commitment for safe and sound operation. FHFA has authority to withhold executive officer compensation for review of reasonableness and comparability. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on government pay rates. Additionally, there is a call for executive officers to return 2009 compensation to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Federal Housing Finance Agency Director will suspend 2010 executive officer compensation at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A new system based on government pay rates will be implemented. Executive officers are required to return any excess 2009 compensation to the Secretary of the Treasury for debt reduction."
