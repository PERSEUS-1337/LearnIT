The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land\" as the 206 acres within the Refuge, \"non-Federal land\" as the State-owned 43,093 acres, \"Refuge\" as Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, \"road corridor\" as designated for construction, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land\" as the 206 acres within the Refuge, \"non-Federal land\" as the State-owned 43,093 acres, \"Refuge\" as Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and \"road corridor\" as designated for construction. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" means the State of Alaska, and \"Wilderness\" refers to the Izembek Wilderness designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Act requires a land exchange. The Act requires a land exchange where the State conveys non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land to designate a road corridor and construct a gravel road. Valuation and appraisals are required to ensure equal value exchange. The Act mandates appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land using recognized standards. If Federal land value exceeds non-Federal land, additional non-Federal land can be conveyed to equalize values. The Act allows for land exchanges between the State and the Secretary through conveying non-Federal land, making cash payments, or a combination of both. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage of the non-Federal land to be conveyed. The Secretary has the discretion to accept a payment exceeding 25 under certain conditions. The Secretary may accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value in land exchanges. After completion, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and non-Federal land will be added and administered according to the Wilderness Act and other laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road construction will adhere to specified regulations. The land exchange and road construction under this Act will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act."
