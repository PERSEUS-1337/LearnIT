    "content": "The \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include State Grants for Drug and Violence Prevention Programs. The \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" reserves funds for specific programs in Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as for Indian youth and Native Hawaiians. State allotments are allocated based on specific criteria. The allocation of funds to states under the \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" is based on the school-aged population of each state and the amount received under part A of title I for the preceding year. States are guaranteed a minimum allotment of one-half of 1 percent of the total amount allotted. The Secretary has the authority to reallot funds to states if they are unable to use the amount within two years. The reallotment of funds to states under the \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" is based on the same basis as initial allotments. Definitions for this subsection include 'State' as each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and 'local educational agency' as educational service agencies and consortia. \"SEC. 4112. STATE APPLICATIONS.\" - This section pertains to the applications submitted by states. To receive funding under section 4111, the State's chief executive officer must submit an application to the Secretary. The application must outline how funds will be coordinated with various programs, provide results of the State's needs assessment for drug and violence prevention, assure cooperation with national impact evaluations, and include any additional information required by the Secretary. The Secretary will review State applications using a peer review process. \"State programs under SEC. 4113 require the State's chief executive officer to submit an application outlining fund coordination, needs assessment for prevention, cooperation with evaluations, and additional information for review by the Secretary.\" The chief executive officer of a State must use allocated funds for drug and violence prevention programs. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of the total amount received. Grants and contracts must be used exclusively for prevention or education programs focused on the dangers of drug use and underage drinking. The allocated funds must be strictly used for drug and violence prevention programs. Any misuse of funds for non-anti-drug purposes will result in penalties. Grants awarded under this program will undergo a peer review process. Law enforcement agencies can receive grants for drug abuse and violence prevention programs in partnership with educational or community-based agencies. The program funds are to be used for drug abuse and violence prevention activities, including classroom instruction by law enforcement officials, legal education programs, partnerships between law enforcement and child guidance professionals, and before- and after-school activities. SEC. 4114. EVALUATION AND REPORTING. The Secretary conducts biennial evaluations of national impact of programs combating school violence, collecting data on violence frequency and seriousness in schools, submitting reports to the President and Congress. The Secretary submits a report to Congress with recommendations and estimated costs for implementing them. States must submit reports on the implementation and outcomes of their programs under section 4113 every three years, including data on drug use and violence by youth in schools and communities. Reports must be in a specified form, based on ongoing evaluation activities, and made available to the public. The Secretary shall provide grants or agreements to organizations serving Native Hawaiians for programs authorized by this title. Native Hawaiian is defined as individuals with ancestors in Hawaii before 1778."
