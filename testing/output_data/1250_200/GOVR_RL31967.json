    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and government accounts, including trust funds like Social Security. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by government surpluses or deficits. Debt held in government accounts is affected by net financial flows. Federal borrowing from the public has increased since the late 1950s, except for a few years. The federal government has consistently borrowed from the public, except for a few years, leading to the accumulation of debt. The growth in federal debt has necessitated Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. When federal debt nears its legal limit, standard methods of financing federal activities can be hindered. Monthly surpluses and deficits affect the level of debt throughout the year. The ability to borrow is crucial for Treasury cash management systems to handle fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the U.S. Treasury is unable to borrow due to a debt limit, it may struggle to meet legal obligations and manage short-term cash flows, leading to potential difficulties in paying bills or investing surpluses in federal debt as required by law. The Treasury may face challenges in meeting legal obligations and managing cash flows if unable to borrow due to a debt limit. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Default on interest payments could have repercussions for economies worldwide. Delaying payments could result in borrowing from vendors, contractors, and others, with potential interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act. The Treasury may face challenges in meeting legal obligations and managing cash flows if unable to borrow due to a debt limit. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Default on interest payments could have repercussions for economies worldwide. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to handle cash and debt management responsibilities in such situations. Congress has authorized the Treasury to take necessary actions to address funding federal obligations. The U.S. Treasury has employed various strategies to manage debt constraints, including selling off mortgage-backed securities and utilizing funds from government trust funds. These actions have expanded options for the Treasury Secretary, but may have minor effects on delaying reaching the legal debt limit. Proceeds from asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations in the long term due to a persistent imbalance between federal revenues and expenditures. The U.S. Treasury faces challenges in managing debt constraints, with asset sales unlikely to provide a long-term solution. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but this has been rejected. The debt limit can disrupt Treasury operations, leading to extraordinary measures to meet obligations and causing uncertainty. The debt limit allows Congress to control federal spending and imposes fiscal accountability by requiring visible action when the government spends more than it collects in revenues. Some experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that other controls in the budget process have superseded its effectiveness. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval. The Obama Administration proposes allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, providing individual Members with a separate instrument to influence federal fiscal policy. Congress has historically placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Between World War I and World War II, statutory restrictions on federal debt evolved into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all federal debt outstanding. Congress historically authorized borrowing for specific purposes and specified details of debt instruments. Concerns about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies became moot after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. For example, the War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness with maturities of a year. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to issue certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and long-term bonds. The act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to have $100 million outstanding in short-term certificates mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. It also allowed the issuance of $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds for public subscription. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 dropped certain limits on bond maturity and redemption, expanding the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded the Treasury Secretary's authority by incorporating unused borrowing capacity and dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. Subsequent borrowing measures were made as amendments to this act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. In the 1920s, Congress gave the Treasury Secretary more flexibility to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues by allowing the issuance of notes and limiting the amount outstanding. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more responsive financial management. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of Treasury's freedom in determining securities to be issued. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau later called for a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds, highlighting their role in managing federal finances. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more responsive financial management. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of Treasury's freedom in determining securities to be issued. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau later called for a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds, highlighting their role in managing federal finances. This led to the establishment of a $45 billion aggregate limit on public debt, combining limits on bonds and shorter-term debt, giving the Treasury more freedom to manage federal debt effectively. The Treasury was granted more flexibility in issuing bonds in the 1930s, allowing for better financial management. The debt limit was increased to $65 billion in 1941, giving the Treasury more independence in managing federal debt. The debt ceiling was raised annually during World War II, reaching $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion. After World War II, the debt limit was reduced to $275 billion. The Eisenhower Administration requested an increase in 1953, but Congress did not raise the limit until 1954. Temporary increases followed, but the limit reverted to $275 billion in 1957. In March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion. Since then, Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the federal debt limit, with recent increases being significant in dollar terms. Since FY2001, federal debt has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Debt held by the public and government accounts has increased steadily. Table 1 and Figure 1 show debt components in current dollars and as percentages of GDP. Debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014 are detailed in Table 2. Federal debt held by government accounts has grown since 1982, partly due to Social Security tax increases recommended by the 1983 Greenspan Commission. Federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982, driven by increases in Social Security taxes recommended by the 1983 Greenspan Commission and the transition of the baby boom generation into peak earnings years. Debt held by the public as a share of GDP fluctuated in response to surpluses or deficits, with surpluses in the late 1990s reducing the debt. However, deficits reemerged in the early 2000s, leading to an increase in debt held by the public. This accumulation of debt in government accounts put pressure on the debt limit in 2002. In FY2002, federally held debt increased by $405 billion, nearing the $5,950 billion debt limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the limit to $6,700 billion due to a deteriorating budget outlook. Treasury suspended reinvestment of government debt on April 4, 2002, to stay below the limit. The Treasury avoided default by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to issue new debt and meet obligations. Debt subject to limit fluctuated, with the Treasury using its authority twice in 2002 to prevent default. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit to address ongoing financing problems. The Treasury avoided default by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to issue new debt and meet obligations. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit or enact other statutory changes to address ongoing financing problems. Treasury's financing problems would persist without a debt limit increase, leading to a debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16, 2002. Treasury took extraordinary actions to reduce federal debt held by trust funds and issue new debt to fund government operations until June 28, 2002. If the debt limit was not increased by then, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling. The Treasury postponed a securities auction and faced the possibility of default due to impending government obligations. Congress debated increasing the debt limit, with the Senate eventually passing a bill to raise it by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The House passed a $450 billion debt limit increase by a single vote on June 27, 2002, to avoid default. The President signed the bill into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. By February 20, 2003, the Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings to prevent reaching the limit. The Treasury took actions to manage debt holdings in certain government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit. These actions allowed for additional debt issuance to acquire cash needed for government commitments. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate eventually passed the debt-limit legislation in May after receiving warnings of imminent default. In May, the Senate passed legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion after receiving warnings of imminent default from the Treasury. By October, the debt subject to limit reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the existing limit. Treasury measures were used to avoid breaching the limit, but Secretary John Snow informed Congress that these measures would be exhausted by mid-November without an increase in the debt limit. The Treasury warned that measures to avoid breaching the debt limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's ability to meet financial obligations. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no agreement on raising the debt limit could be reached. The House added an amendment to limit the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the existing limit. The House added an amendment to limit the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the existing limit. Legislation was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law, allowing the Treasury to reschedule debt auctions and avoid a \"debt limit suspension period.\" Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic than in President Bush's first term. In 2005, Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. However, neither committee reported a bill to raise the debt limit. The adoption of the conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, producing a House Joint Resolution that would raise the debt limit to $8,965 billion. As of the end of the first session of the 109th Congress, the Senate had not considered the resolution. In December 2005, Secretary of the Treasury Snow warned Congress that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006. He requested an increase in the debt limit, which was eventually raised to $8,965 billion in March 2006. Congress passed the debt limit increase after the Senate took up H.J.Res. 47 and rejected several amendments. In March 2006, the President signed a bill raising the debt limit to $8,965 billion. In September 2007, Congress passed a joint resolution raising the limit to $9,815 billion, which the President signed into law. Treasury had warned of reaching the limit in October 2007, prompting the increase. The financial crisis of 2008 led to a recession that lasted until 2009, prompting federal actions to stabilize the housing and financial markets. The recession resulted in a rapid deceleration of housing prices and a rise in interest rate spreads, leading to major efforts to unfreeze credit markets and boost consumption. This economic downturn also caused federal deficits to spike to 9.8% of GDP, with subsequent weak economic recovery compared to other post-World War II recessions. The economic recovery post-2009 has been weak compared to other post-World War II recessions, impacting the federal deficit in various ways. Falling asset prices reduce federal revenues, while job cuts and unemployment lead to lower individual income taxes. Deficit spending can stimulate the economy if output levels are below potential, but can also accelerate inflation and worsen long-term fiscal challenges. The CBO estimated deficits of $396 billion in FY2008 and $342 billion in FY2009. In March 2008, CBO estimated President's budget would lead to $396 billion deficit in FY2008 and $342 billion deficit in FY2009. Actual deficit for FY2008 reached $455 billion. CBO estimated deficit would total $1,587 billion in FY2009 and $1,381 billion in FY2010. Federal debt limit was raised multiple times due to economic conditions and government actions. House and Senate resolutions recommended policies resulting in $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion debt in FY2009 respectively. Budget conference report passed Senate on 48-45 vote on June 4, 2008. The House and Senate passed resolutions recommending policies resulting in a $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion debt in FY2009. The House then passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, which was later signed into law by the President on July 30, 2008. This legislation also included provisions for extending a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created to replace the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). There was concern about the debt limit hindering the Treasury Secretary's ability to support Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, leading to their conservatorship by the FHFA. The U.S. Treasury later proposed measures to stabilize financial markets. On September 20, 2008, the U.S. Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related assets to stabilize financial markets. The proposal included raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Despite initial rejection by the House, a different version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was passed by the Senate on October 1, 2008, and signed into law on October 3, 2008, raising the debt limit. This was in response to current economic conditions and the need for another economic stimulus measure containing tax cuts and spending. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was passed by Congress on February 13, 2009, containing provisions to raise the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion, requiring an increase in the statutory debt limit. The budget resolution for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion, requiring an increase in the statutory debt limit. The adoption of a conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, resulting in a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) to raise the debt limit by $925 billion to $13,029 billion. Treasury postponed reaching the debt limit by reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back TARP to lower federal debt, while repayments by financial institutions could also reduce debt subject to the limit. Other measures, like those taken in 2003, could extend the Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. The Treasury was set to issue nonmarketable securities and make interest payments, which could challenge debt management without a limit increase. Senior House Members opted for a smaller debt limit increase over a larger one. Senior Members of the House chose a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow normal debt management operations for two months. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passed by the House and Senate in December 2009. An amended version, H.J.Res. 45, raised the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion, with a PAYGO amendment approved. Some Members called for a national commission to address federal debt. An amendment to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" failed to reach 60 votes on January 26, 2010. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, 2010, raising the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion. President Obama signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating statutory caps on discretionary spending. The U.S. Treasury Secretary announced a debt issuance suspension period due to reaching the statutory debt limit. Extraordinary measures were used to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. The federal deficit was projected to reach $1,399 billion, leading to suggestions of cutting spending to avoid increasing the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury announced a suspension of reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a measure to avoid exceeding the debt limit. Cash flow projections indicated a potential shortfall in funding federal operations without a debt limit increase. Treasury estimates showed a significant gap between cash inflows and outflows from August 3 onwards. The U.S. Treasury projected a potential shortfall in funding federal operations without a debt limit increase of $306.7 billion. Estimates of when the debt limit would bind and how long extraordinary measures would suffice have shifted. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities helped expand the headroom between federal debt and its limit. Treasury Secretary indicated a debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. The Treasury Secretary indicated a debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. Measures such as the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program have already taken place, and new issues of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended. Treasury projected a potential shortfall in funding federal operations without a debt limit increase, with estimates shifting on when the debt limit would bind. The U.S. Treasury projected exhaustion of borrowing capacity by July 8, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was defeated on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced in different forms by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid on July 25, 2011. President Obama signed the Budget Control Act into law on August 2, 2011, eliminating the need for further increases in the debt limit until early. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was approved by the House and Senate in August 2011, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. It included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions (sequester), a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a procedure for raising the debt ceiling. The legislation allowed for a $400 billion increase in the debt limit initially, followed by a $500 billion increase. The debt limit was raised by $400 billion on August 2, 2011, and by an additional $500 billion on September 22, 2011. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure, while the House passed one but the Senate did not act on it. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, triggering a provision for a third increase of $1.2 trillion. The debt limit was raised by $400 billion on August 2, 2011, and by an additional $500 billion on September 22, 2011. A third increase of $1.2 trillion was triggered in late December 2011, matching budget reductions slated for FY2013-FY2021. Congress considered various options for increasing the debt limit, including a balanced budget amendment and recommendations from the Super Committee, but neither were successful. The debt limit was raised multiple times in 2011, with the last increase of $1.2 trillion matching budget reductions for FY2013-FY2021. In 2013, the debt limit was suspended until May 19, 2013, allowing the Treasury to replenish funds and reset its ability to use extraordinary measures. After the suspension lapsed, the debt limit was reset at $16,699 billion. After the debt limit suspension lapsed in May 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit at $16,699 billion. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period and sent notices to Congress about the expected exhaustion of borrowing capacity. Strong revenue collections and dividends pushed back the exhaustion date to no later than October 17, 2013, when Congress passed a continuing resolution. On October 17, 2013, Congress passed a resolution to end the government shutdown and suspend the debt limit until February 8, 2014. The debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion, and extraordinary measures were used. Subsequently, Congress suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2015, and the limit was reset to $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew employed extraordinary measures until July 30. The U.S. Treasury employed extraordinary measures to meet federal financial obligations, extending until the end of October. Secretary Lew indicated that these measures would provide a brief additional period of time after October. However, on October 15, 2015, it was stated that the measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve on hand. Initial estimates expected the measures to last until November or early December 2015, but lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced the Treasury's headroom. In September 2015, analysts projected federal obligations could be met until mid-November 2015. A \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, reset the debt limit to March 16, 2017. The agreement also increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The House concurred with Senate amendments on October 28, 2015, passing the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was approved by the Senate on October 30, 2015, and signed by the President on November 2, 2015 (P.L. 114-74). The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, but deficits increased due to higher military and security spending after 9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions, and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 led to large federal deficits and accelerated total debt growth, necessitating debt limit increases. Fiscal costs of a crisis are overshadowed by reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. While fiscal concerns were prominent in 2011, deficits have since decreased with economic recovery. However, without policy changes, persistent deficits could significantly raise federal debt, leading to unsustainable borrowing and slower economic growth. The CBO has warned about the unsustainable trajectory of federal borrowing, leading to slower economic growth as debt increases. Without policy changes, Congress would need to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt. Total federal debt has increased significantly since FY2001, with debt held by government accounts and the public also rising. Total federal debt increased by $12,380 billion from September 2001 to September 2015, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions, influenced by uneven federal receipts and outlays throughout the fiscal year."
