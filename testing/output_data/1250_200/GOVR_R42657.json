    "content": "Congress appropriates federal payments to the District for funding activities and reviews the District's budget, including local funds. The District's appropriations act is now included in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. District appropriations acts consist of special federal payments, the operating budget for day-to-day functions, and long-term capital outlays. The District's budget is funded by user fees, local taxes, federal funds, and other sources. General provisions in the budget cover fiscal directives, administrative controls, and restrictions. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included $677.8 million in federal payments to the District, an increase from the previous year. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included $677.8 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a significant portion allocated to the courts and criminal justice system. This included funding for court operations, Defender Services, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the public defender's office, and costs associated with investigating judicial misconduct complaints. Additionally, the budget included support for education initiatives such as elementary and secondary education, the D.C. National Guard college access program, and college tuition assistance. The FY2013 budget included $60 million for elementary and secondary education, $500,000 for the D.C. National Guard college access program, and $35.1 million for college tuition assistance, representing 14% of the Administration's federal payment budget request for the District of Columbia. The mayor submitted a proposed budget to the District of Columbia Council on March 23, 2012, which was approved on May 15, 2012, totaling $11.4 billion in operating funds and $1.1 billion in capital outlays. The mayor signed the measure on June 15, 2012, including a provision for budget autonomy in the expenditure of local funds if Congress failed to pass a District of Columbia appropriations act. The House and Senate FSGG bills during the 112th Congress, along with subsequent appropriations acts, referenced the District's FY2013 budget submission for congressional review and approval. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $676.2 million in special federal payments to the District for FY2013, which was more than the previous year's appropriation and the Administration's request. The bill also allocated additional funding for court operations compared to the Administration's request but less than the previous year's appropriation. The Senate bill for FY2013 would have appropriated $7.4 million less than the previous year's funding for education initiatives in the District of Columbia. It included provisions for public school improvements, support for public charter schools, and a private school voucher program, which was not included in the Administration's budget request. The bill also included provisions for budgetary and fiscal controls, as well as restrictions on the use of federal funds for District statehood or voting representation. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2013, H.R. 6020, which included provisions related to congressional voting representation, funding for the office of Statehood Representative and Statehood Senator for the District of Columbia, and restrictions on the use of federal funds for various purposes. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2013, H.R. 6020, with $673.7 million in special federal payments to the District. The bill included increased funding for court operations and directed $60 million to support education in the District. The House bill, H.R. 6020, focused on budgetary and fiscal controls, prohibiting deficit spending, and allowing fund transfers. It also included provisions on statehood representation and support for District initiatives. Unlike the Senate bill, it would have prohibited certain fund uses. H.R. 6020 focused on budgetary controls and fiscal measures, prohibiting deficit spending and certain fund uses. The bill also addressed statehood representation and District initiatives. Despite federal restrictions, the city certified medical marijuana dispensaries, with the first one opening in June 2013. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about the bill's provisions, including the prohibition of federal funds for the District's needle exchange program. The bill prohibited federal funds for the District's needle exchange program and abortion services, which was objected to by the Obama Administration. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2013 funding levels and allowed the District to spend locally-raised funds as outlined in the Budget Request Act of 2012. Special federal payments were also appropriated for emergency planning and security costs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $24.7 million in special federal payments for emergency planning and security costs, with $9.8 million designated for expenses related to the Presidential Inauguration. The act allowed the District of Columbia to use its local funds as specified in the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Request Act of 2012. Additionally, the Obama Administration proposed $677.8 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia in FY2013. The Obama Administration budget proposal for FY2013 included special federal payments for the District of Columbia. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended different amounts for these payments. The 112th Congress passed a resolution extending funding at a 0.6% increase above FY2012 levels. Additionally, $9.8 million was allocated for expenses related to the Presidential Inauguration. The District of Columbia received special federal payments in FY2013, with funding levels outlined in P.L.113-6. The District's General Fund Budget for FY2013 totaled $11.4 billion, including $9.4 billion for operating expenses and $1.9 billion for enterprise funds. The District's FY2013 General Fund Budget totaled $11.4 billion, with $9.4 billion for operating expenses and $1.9 billion for enterprise funds. Key policy issues for Congress included funding for a needle exchange program to address HIV and AIDS among drug abusers, with proponents citing reduced HIV spread and opponents concerned about government sanctioning of illegal drugs. Opponents argue against providing drug-addicted individuals with tools for drug use, citing concerns about HIV and AIDS spread through contaminated needles. The debate also touches on home rule and the city's ability to implement needle exchange programs using local funds free from congressional restrictions. Congressional acts have prohibited the use of federal and District funds for needle exchange programs, with restrictions on privately funded activities as well. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act of FY2002 initially included a provision to ban distributing needles near schools for drug injection, but it was removed during congressional consideration. The act allowed private funds for needle exchange programs but prohibited the use of District and federal funds. Prevention Works currently operates a needle exchange program, with requirements to track fund usage. District officials tried to lift the funding prohibition in the FY2004 Act, but it was unsuccessful. There were debates on using federal and District funds for needle exchange programs in subsequent legislative discussions. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act allowed the use of District funds for needle exchange programs to combat HIV/AIDS among drug users, departing from previous acts that prohibited both District and federal funds. The act also urged the Bush Administration to provide federal funding to address the city's health crisis. The FY2013 budget proposal and House and Senate bills retained this language. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 and House and Senate bills included language retaining the allowance of District funds for needle exchange programs to combat HIV/AIDS. The Obama Administration urged the removal of language prohibiting the use of federal funds for such programs. P.L. 113-6 maintained the prohibition on federal funds for needle exchange programs. The city's medical marijuana initiative is another controversial issue. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 prohibited the counting of a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative, but a court ruling allowed the city to tally the votes. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent the initiative's implementation. The marijuana ballot initiative (Initiative 59) in the District of Columbia was blocked by congressional actions in the FY2000 and FY2002 Appropriations Acts. Opponents argued that this undermined home rule. Legal challenges were made to allow the initiative to be put on the ballot, but a congressional rider prevented the District from using public funds for this purpose. The FY2000 and FY2002 Appropriations Acts blocked the marijuana ballot initiative in the District of Columbia. Legal challenges were made, leading to a court ruling that the congressional ban on using public funds for the initiative was unconstitutional. The ruling was later reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the authority to regulate interstate drug marketing, including possession in states that have decriminalized marijuana. Since the passage of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2010, subsequent appropriations acts have not included language prohibiting the use of District funds to regulate the medical use of marijuana. In 2010, the District of Columbia Council approved legislation regulating the medical use of marijuana, allowing up to five dispensaries to operate. Congressional bills aimed to prohibit federal funds from supporting the legalization of marijuana, but P.L. 113-6 continued this prohibition. The use of federal funds for decriminalizing medical marijuana and public funding of abortion services in the District of Columbia has been a debated issue in Congress. Since 1979, Congress has placed limitations on the use of public funds for abortion services for District residents. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1989 restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. President Reagan and President George H. W. Bush endorsed these restrictions, with Bush vetoing the FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue. The FY1994 act removed the provision limiting District funding of abortion services and reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994 reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, subsequent acts limited the use of funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered, rape, incest, or a threat to the woman's life if the pregnancy was carried to term. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request included a provision that would have prohibited the use of federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term. The House bill, H.R. 6020, included language that would have restricted the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 113-6 allows the District to use its own funds for abortion services in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the pregnant woman is jeopardized. The House passed two bills in 2012 that aimed to restrict abortion services in the District of Columbia. H.R. 3 would have banned federal and District funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the woman's life. H.R. 3803 would have prohibited abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for life-threatening conditions, and allowed legal action against violators. The House passed two bills in 2012 to restrict abortion services in the District of Columbia. H.R. 3803 would have prohibited abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for life-threatening conditions, and allowed legal action against violators. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program, a school voucher program for the District of Columbia. The Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia provides federal funds for private schools, public education improvement, and public charter schools. It is part of a three-prong approach to support elementary and secondary education. The program was reauthorized through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, with $60 million authorized annually for FY2012 through FY2016. The funds are divided evenly among DCPS, public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program. The reauthorized Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia receives funding alongside DCPS and public charter schools. The Obama Administration's proposed budget for FY2013 did not include funds for the Opportunity Scholarship program. S. 3301 allocated $53.5 million for school improvement, with $20 million for DCPS, $20 million for public charter schools, and $13.5 million for the Opportunity Scholarship program. H.R. 6020 also supported all three initiatives. P.L. 113-6 appropriated $59.8 million evenly among public schools, public charter schools, and school vouchers."
