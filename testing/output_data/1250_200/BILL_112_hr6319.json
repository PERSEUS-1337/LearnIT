    "content": "The \"Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012\" allows certain startup companies to receive treatment for research credit. The \"Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012\" allows qualified small businesses to elect to treat the payroll tax credit portion of the credit as a credit under section 3111(f) if it does not exceed $250,000 in any taxable year. The gross receipts threshold for qualifying entities under the \"Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012\" is less than $5,000,000 for the taxable year, with no prior gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. Individuals are also eligible based on aggregate gross receipts received. The \"Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012\" sets a gross receipts threshold for qualifying entities below $5,000,000 for the taxable year, with no prior gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. Individuals qualify based on aggregate gross receipts received, while organizations exempt from taxation under section 501 are excluded. Partnerships or S corporations must make an election at the entity level, which cannot be revoked without the Secretary's consent. Taxpayers cannot make this election if they have done so for 5 or more preceding taxable years. Aggregation rules apply for determining eligibility. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent avoidance of the gross receipts threshold, minimize compliance burdens for start-up companies, and recapture benefits under the Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012. The IRS will establish regulations to reduce recordkeeping burdens for start-up companies and recapture credits in cases of payroll tax adjustments. Additionally, a new amendment disregards election under section 41(i) for determining credits under section 41(a). A new subsection allows a credit for research expenditures of qualified small businesses against FICA taxes. The tax code of 1986 is amended to allow a credit for research expenditures of qualified small businesses against FICA taxes. This credit is available for small businesses that have made an election under section 41(i) and is equal to the payroll tax credit portion of the research credit determined under section 41(a). Unused credits can be carried over to the succeeding calendar quarter. The tax code of 1986 allows a credit for research expenditures of qualified small businesses against FICA taxes. The credit is reduced for preceding calendar quarters and allocated for controlled groups. Definitions for terms like \"applicable calendar quarter\" are provided. The tax code of 1986 provides a credit for research expenditures of qualified small businesses against FICA taxes. The credit is determined for each applicable calendar quarter following the filing of a return under section 6012 for the taxable year. Terms used in this subsection have the same meaning as in section 41. Transfers to federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund and federal disability insurance trust fund are appropriated amounts equal to the reduction in revenues to the Treasury due to the amendments. These amounts will be transferred from the general fund to replicate transfers that would have occurred if the amendments were not enacted. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
