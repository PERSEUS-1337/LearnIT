    "content": "The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended by this Act. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that two-thirds of mothers with children under 6 are in the workforce, over 10% of young children have disabilities, and there is a limited supply of infant care and care for special needs children, especially in low-income communities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates early intervention and special education preschool services for children with disabilities. The purpose of this Act is to increase the supply of quality child care for children with disabilities, especially in low-income communities where there is a limited supply of infant care and care for special needs children. Staff lack sufficient training to meet the needs of children with disabilities, leading to many being barred from child care programs. The Act aims to improve the quality of child care for children with disabilities, particularly in low-income areas with limited infant care options. It includes provisions to ensure families with children with disabilities have access to suitable child care programs. Section 658G (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended to require states to allocate at least 5 percent of funds for activities aimed at improving child care for children with disabilities. Eligible activities include training and technical assistance programs. Training and technical assistance are provided for child care providers, state licensing agencies, and parents to collaborate on implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Family home and center child care providers receive technical assistance to include children with disabilities. Child care directors and staff are trained on using assistive technology for children with special needs. Training and technical assistance are provided for child care providers, state licensing agencies, and parents to collaborate on implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This includes training child care directors and staff on the use of assistive technology for children with special needs and disabilities, developing leadership skills for inclusive child care programs, and assisting child care resource agencies with compliance. Grants are also available for recruiting and retaining qualified staff, including scholarships for child care staff working with children with disabilities. Grants are provided for scholarships and salary increases for child care staff working with children with and without disabilities to obtain degrees or training in child development. Additionally, grants and loans are available for projects that increase the availability of inclusive child care programs and child care for infants.
