    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress established different approaches for existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given state discretion to set emission ceilings, while new sources had to meet strict technology-based standards set by the EPA. The 1977 amendments further addressed areas with cleaner air than national ambient standards. The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments introduced new requirements for major new sources in areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards. These sources must undergo New Source Review (NSR) and obtain permits with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The act also applies NSR to modifications of existing sources, ensuring compliance with emission standards. The Clean Air Act introduced New Source Review (NSR) requirements for major new sources and modifications of existing sources in areas with different air quality standards. The definition of \"modification\" under the act determines which changes trigger NSR, focusing on physical changes that increase emissions. The Clean Air Act introduced New Source Review (NSR) requirements for major new sources and modifications of existing sources in areas with different air quality standards. The definition of \"modification\" under the act determines which changes trigger NSR, focusing on physical changes that result in an increase in emissions. EPA's definition of \"reconstruction\" involves replacing components of an existing facility to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable entirely new facility. The Clean Air Act introduced New Source Review (NSR) requirements for major new sources and modifications of existing sources in areas with different air quality standards. The act defines \"modification\" as physical changes that increase emissions. The EPA has exceptions for changes in stationary sources that are not considered modifications, such as routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR). Eligibility for the RMRR exemption was previously determined through case-by-case analysis. The EPA determined that WEPCO's proposed \"life extension\" program triggered NSPS and PSD-area NSR, requiring a permit for construction. The Seventh Circuit ruled that the proposal exceeded routine maintenance due to the substantial and unprecedented extent of work on the plant. Recent years have seen the RMRR exemption become a focal point, following CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for making changes without installing NSR controls. In response to CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities, the EPA issued final regulations in December 2002 affecting how emission increases are calculated for NSR purposes. Additionally, the EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as routine maintenance without further considerations. This proposal was made in EPA v. Whitman, following the Eleventh Circuit's decision on the matter. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman addressed the EPA's determination that the TVA violated the CAA through projects exceeding RMRR without permits. The court ruled that EPA must prove CAA violations in district court, allowing TVA to violate ACOs without penalty. This decision did not address the RMRR exception itself. The EPA's final rule in October 2003 reshaped the contours of the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR. This new approach aims to provide greater regulatory certainty while addressing criticism of the old case-by-case approach. The rule did not address the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement allowance. The EPA's new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's value and does not change its design or emissions compliance. This approach allows for more replacements without the need for a case-by-case evaluation, reducing controversy. The former case-by-case approach remains available as an alternative, but the new per se approach is expected to be more commonly used. The rule does not require additional recordkeeping. The EPA's new rule on equipment-replacement RMRR specifies that replacing components with identical or functional equivalents below 20% of the unit's value and without design or emissions changes constitutes RMRR. This approach aims to reduce the need for case-by-case evaluations. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the rule's authority under the CAA, with a stay granted pending further review. The court has granted a stay on the EPA's new rule on equipment-replacement RMRR, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits. The rule was set to take effect on December 26, 2003, but is now suspended, reverting back to the old case-by-case approach. The court also declined to consolidate the cases challenging the rule with another group of cases but designated the same panel for both sets of cases due to their related nature."
