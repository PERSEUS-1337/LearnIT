    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, such as Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, potentially leading to regional and global proliferation consequences. The U.S. faces difficulties in peeling Syria away from its alliance with Iran and advancing Israeli-Arab peace efforts. The Obama Administration's efforts to improve the United States' image in the Middle East have been met with mixed results. Despite outreach to the Muslim world and attempts to close Guantanamo, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy remains. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the Israeli-Arab peace process have diminished U.S. influence in the region. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility for resolving disputes, while the Middle East grapples with economic challenges and human rights issues. The Middle East faces various challenges such as poverty, income inequality, population growth, and water scarcity. Lack of human rights respect and democracy development are criticized. The US advocates for economic and political reform. Congressional questions include addressing Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, budget constraints, support for regional initiatives, and dealing with radical regimes like Iran and Syria. The 112th Congress may need to address issues in the Middle East such as the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, and human rights concerns. Economic sanctions against Iran are being considered to curb its nuclear development. The 112th Congress may need to address issues in the Middle East such as the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, and human rights concerns. Economic sanctions against Iran are being considered to curb its nuclear development. The U.S. has been adopting progressively stricter economic sanctions against Iran to target its energy sector and isolate it from the international financial system. Measures by the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, and several countries complement U.S. laws to slow Iran's alleged weapons of mass destruction programs and curb its support for militant groups. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 expanded efforts to restrict Iran's ability to make deals with foreign companies. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) expanded efforts to restrict Iran's ability to import gasoline and conduct transactions with sanctioned entities. It also added measures to limit U.S. trade with Iran and high technology trade with countries aiding Iran's weapons programs. This followed the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and European Union sanctions to further isolate Iran economically. The EU, Japan, and South Korea have imposed sanctions on Iran's energy sector, impacting its economy. Major international firms are exiting the Iranian market. There is debate on whether sanctions are affecting Iran's nuclear program. The 112th Congress may consider additional Iran sanctions and support for Iran's domestic opposition. The U.S. and Israel maintain strong bilateral relations based on shared strategic goals in the Middle East. The strong bilateral relations between the U.S. and Israel are supported by factors such as domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties dating back to Israel's creation in 1948. U.S. foreign aid plays a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the region, while Congress and successive administrations have consistently affirmed their commitment to enhancing Israel's security and military edge over neighboring countries. The Obama Administration reaffirmed its commitment to preserving Israel's qualitative military edge (QME) in 2010. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel to maintain its QME, with a request for $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Additionally, defense appropriations for co-research and development of missile defense systems could be a key issue, with over $202 million appropriated for U.S.-Israeli missile defense in FY2010. The Obama Administration announced additional defense assistance of $205 million for Israel in 2010, specifically for the purchase of Iron Dome missile defense batteries. Congressional aid appropriations have historically supported peace treaties and the peace process in the region. President Obama emphasized Israeli-Palestinian peace as a U.S. national security interest, despite early tensions over Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank. The Obama Administration provided $205 million in defense assistance to Israel in 2010 for Iron Dome missile defense batteries. Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Mahmud Abbas called for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank to participate in direct talks with Israel. Despite efforts to achieve a settlement freeze, settlements remain a major obstacle to negotiations on final status issues. In December, negotiations on final status issues in the Arab-Israeli peace process focused on borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress showed interest in the peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Resolutions were introduced to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy. The Obama Administration maintained that Jerusalem is a final status issue for negotiation. Appropriations legislation required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. Congress also passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to possible violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. U.S. aid to the Palestinians supports combating terrorism, promoting stability in the West Bank, and meeting humanitarian needs. If an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is achieved, additional assistance may be provided to Israel and the Palestinians. U.S. aid policy towards the Palestinians during the 111th Congress has focused on promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank, aiding humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip, and preventing destabilization. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has averaged over $600 million, with a significant portion allocated for direct budgetary assistance and security aid to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The U.S. provides train-and-equip security assistance for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, along with humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees in Gaza through UNRWA. Congressional concerns about potential diversion of funds to terrorist groups have led to strict oversight and vetting requirements. U.S. policymakers urge Arab states to increase their contributions. Additionally, proposed military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia could be worth over $60 billion over 10 to 15 years. The proposed military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia include 84 new F-15SA fighter aircraft, upgrades for 70 F-15S fighter aircraft, 70 new AH-64D Block III APACHE helicopters, and various other helicopters. The Obama Administration aims to strengthen Saudi Arabia's position against Iran and maintain long-term relationships for continued U.S. influence. This raises policy questions for Congress regarding the rationale for the sales and their impact on regional security and Israel's security. Improvements in U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation with Al Qaeda praised, but challenges remain on terrorist financing. Concerns persist about human rights in Saudi Arabia and religious extremism export. Saudi leaders wary of embracing Iraq's government and engaging Israel beyond Arab Peace Initiative. Congress reviewed proposed arms sales in 111th Congress, with concerns raised by 198 members in a letter to Obama Administration. Administration believes in strengthening long-standing U.S. military partnership. The U.S. government aims to supply Israel with advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to maintain its military edge over neighbors. Proposed sales to Saudi Arabia were opposed in H.J.Res. 104. Congress may increase oversight on military training and arms sales to Saudi Arabia. U.S. has been involved in training and arming Saudi military since the 1940s, with ongoing support programs. New programs for Saudi interior security forces are also in place. The U.S. government provides military training and equipment support to Saudi Arabia, with new programs for interior security forces. Congress has the option to block or modify arms sales to Saudi Arabia, subject to presidential veto. There may be increased oversight on U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia due to policy concerns. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists targeting the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks, including the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009. Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue, has been linked to radicalizing individuals like Major Nidal Hasan and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen while avoiding excessive militarization. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to counter terrorism without overly militarizing the U.S. presence. There are discussions about potentially increasing the use of drones and placing U.S. military units under CIA control. Congress may evaluate the balance between short-term counterterrorism needs and long-term stabilization goals in Yemen. Lawmakers may demand more U.S. military involvement if AQAP poses a threat to the United States. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing significant aid and proposing increased security assistance. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against AQAP, but disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists. The sustainability of U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation is a key question for lawmakers and policymakers. The U.S. intervened in Iraq to resolve political infighting and help form a new government after the 2010 elections. Despite concerns about waning U.S. influence, major factions eventually agreed on leadership positions, leading to the formation of a broad-based government with potential challenges in reaching consensus on major issues. The new government in Iraq, dominated by parties aligned with Iran, faces challenges in reaching consensus on major issues. Concerns about waning U.S. influence and potential conflicts between Kurdish and Arab factions persist. Despite the drawdown of U.S. forces, uncertainty and disillusionment remain high, with experts questioning future stability post-2011. Some believe Iraq could become a \"failed state\" without continued U.S. presence. Iraqi Security Forces may not meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, raising concerns about the country's future. The formation of the new government in Iraq, aligned with Iran, poses challenges in reaching consensus. U.S. officials aim to secure a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq, despite opposition from some Iraqi parties. The transition from military to civilian leadership in Iraq is underway, with the State Department overseeing increased civilian personnel and costs. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has decreased since the reconstruction period, with the focus now on defining terms of security cooperation and potential arms sales. The U.S. Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance for Iraq reached $382.5 million in FY2010. The FY2011 funding for Iraq is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. Concerns exist in the 112th Congress regarding Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to grow, but it faces challenges with domestic investment needs and financial management. The transition from U.S. military operations to a civilian-led presence in Iraq provides new avenues for oversight by Congress. The transition from U.S. military operations to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for oversight by Congress. Congress may consider appropriations, authorization requests, and arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey, a long-term U.S. NATO ally, has complex bilateral relations with certain aspects drawing congressional attention, including issues related to diaspora communities and foreign policy reorientation. Congressional concern increased after Turkey's actions against U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and a violent confrontation with Israeli commandos. In the 111th Congress, legislation called for urging Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a resolution affirming the U.S. historical record on the Armenian genocide. In the 112th Congress, issues concerning the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution may arise again. In the 112th Congress, issues regarding Turkey may resurface, including the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution. Ankara may seek US funding for missile defense systems. Congressional interest in potential changes from the 2011 Turkish election may lead to oversight hearings. Lawmakers may also focus on US policy towards Syria to counter Iran's influence. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Syria in 2009, engaging in diplomatic dialogue but maintaining sanctions. After two years of diplomatic efforts, the focus is now on pressuring Syria to stabilize Lebanon and advance the Arab-Israeli peace process amidst concerns about Hezbollah's potential destabilization. Hezbollah's threat to destabilize Lebanon in response to potential indictments by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon has raised international concern. The Obama Administration's shift towards Syria in 2009 aimed at diplomatic dialogue while maintaining sanctions. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions on the Asad regime and funding democracy programs for opposition members and human rights activists. The United States supports democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists repressed by the Asad government. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria is on hold, with no vote planned for confirmation in the Senate. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, limit Iranian and Syrian influence, and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. provides economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector, since Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005. The U.S. also supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. The United States supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges due to pending STL indictments leading to increased sectarian tension with Hezbollah. Hezbollah's rejection of potential indictments and Hariri's changing statements have raised questions about U.S. support for Hariri and the STL. Changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance to Lebanon, especially if Hezbollah gains a larger role. Members of Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request. The 112th Congress may need to consider U.S. assistance to Lebanon, especially in light of Hezbollah's potential expanded role. In August 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) clashed with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) along the Blue Line, leading to casualties. Some members of Congress halted a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon over concerns about U.S. equipment being used against Israel. The incident raised questions about the future of U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The incident in Lebanon raised questions about future U.S. assistance. The 112th Congress may express support for a more democratic government in Egypt. Egypt is a key partner for the U.S. in regional affairs and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Political liberalization in Egypt could have implications for the Middle East. There are concerns about the Muslim Brotherhood potentially taking over the government. In the November and December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats, with reports of election irregularities and concerns about fairness and transparency. The U.S. Administration expressed disappointment over disruptions to opposition candidates' campaigns and arrests of their supporters, as well as interference and intimidation by security forces on election day. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid, which could be used as a tool to promote democracy in the country. Congress has provided Egypt with $1.5 billion in military and economic aid over the years. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs. Despite a decrease in overall economic aid to Egypt, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010, allocated $25 million for democracy promotion. U.S. democracy assistance has decreased, with $25 million allocated for democracy promotion in Egypt in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010. Some believe the Obama Administration wants to ease tensions with Egypt by reducing democracy assistance, while others argue for more effective aid targeting daily life improvements. Critics suggest conditioning U.S. aid on Egypt's human rights and religious freedom record. Despite efforts to weaken Al Qaeda post-9/11, the organization and its affiliates remain persistent threats. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to pose a threat to the United States, with operatives determined to exploit vulnerabilities and promote low-cost, independent operations. The spread of Al Qaeda's ideology through sophisticated online outreach complicates counterterrorism efforts. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face challenges balancing counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. The past decade of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has shown the costs and limits of targeting Al Qaeda. The past decade has shown the costs and limits of U.S. military operations targeting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Iraq. The continued presence of U.S. forces in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia remains a subject of Al Qaeda rhetoric despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. U.S. support for democratic reform risks alienating allies and empowering Islamist parties. Public opinion polls suggest skepticism and criticism of U.S. policies among Muslims despite increased outreach efforts. Public opinion polls show Muslim skepticism of U.S. intentions and policies despite increased outreach efforts. Suggestions for U.S. counterterrorism policy range from direct military action against Al Qaeda to a containment strategy. The 111th Congress held hearings on specific terrorist threats, foreign assistance, and terrorist financing. The 112th Congress may evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement efforts in predominantly Muslim countries, focusing on maintaining partnerships in Iraq, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, and securing greater cooperation from Gulf allies. Congressional interest also includes peace efforts between Israel and its neighbors. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions and U.S. policy are listed in the appendix.
