    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, with market-oriented mechanisms being more cost-effective. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senators Jeffords and Carper, with the latter imposing stricter requirements. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study but relented after the Clear Skies bill failed to advance in the Senate committee. The EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the Clear Skies bill and other Senate bills regulating air pollution from electric utility generating facilities. The analysis included emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide, which pose risks to human health and welfare. The combustion of fossil fuels accounts for two-thirds of U.S. electricity generation and results in the emission of these pollutants. The EPA has finalized rules to regulate mercury and other gases like carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming. Emissions of SO2 and NOx from electric generating facilities have decreased due to regulations, while CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired electric plants are major contributors to emissions. Hg emissions from utility facilities are uncertain but significant. The evolution of air pollution controls and scientific understanding have led to a complex system of regulations. The evolving air pollution controls have led to a complex system of regulations, including controls on NOx, SO2, and Hg emissions. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. There are calls for a simplified \"multi-pollutant\" approach to regulate utility emissions. The \"four-pollutant\" approach aims to regulate utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 through a mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms. This approach has already been incorporated into existing law with finalized rules such as CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR. Further reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions are necessary due to new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles. In 2005, nationwide regulations aimed to reduce emissions of NOx, SO2, and mercury from power plants. Concerns about mercury pollution have led to fish consumption advisories in 44 states. Legislation like \"Clear Skies\" proposes multi-pollutant controls on utilities to achieve health and environmental goals more efficiently. Legislative proposals aim to reduce emissions from electric generating facilities through a system of tradeable allowances. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of caps, reduction mandates, and inclusion of carbon dioxide. The Clear Skies bill would impose the least stringent standards with deadlines set for 2018, but actual reduction targets may not be met for a decade due to banking provisions. Utilities may \"overcomply\" in the early years of the program. The use of \"banking\" provisions in the regulatory scheme allows utilities to overcomply in the early years, building up credits for future emission reductions. This could delay reaching emissions caps, with Clear Skies not expecting full reductions until 2026 or later. Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier and more stringent caps, leading to compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not control carbon dioxide emissions, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Clear Skies bill does not impose controls on carbon dioxide emissions, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. The cost-benefit analysis by the EPA examined various options, showing little difference between the Clear Skies options. The discussion can be simplified to three principal choices: Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The most recent version of Clear Skies, the Managers' Mark version, was offered at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The EPA chose the Managers' Mark version of the Clear Skies bill as the baseline for their analysis, despite three recently finalized rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg control. The decision to exclude these rules is unclear, and the EPA designated them as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling pollutants. This report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as the baseline for clean air regulation. The EPA's analysis of clean air regulation focuses on uncertainties in future legislation and regulations. The analysis emphasizes Electric Demand Price Elasticity and scenarios with varying demand responses to increasing electricity prices. It is crucial to work from updated baseline projections for accurate analysis. The EPA analyzes scenarios with different price elasticities, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply assumptions to develop four scenarios for clean air regulation. The EPA developed four scenarios for clean air regulation based on different assumptions, including price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply. The scenarios include the Base Case, No Construction Constraint, Demand Response, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas scenarios. The report uses the Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis, highlighting the importance of including a short-term demand response function in the modeling. The EPA developed four scenarios for clean air regulation, including the Demand Response Scenario with short-term price elasticities. EPA's assumption on boilermaker labor availability until 2010 has been questioned. The EPA's regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) has been questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC), who found no constraint on construction labor availability. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of pollution control equipment in short periods of time, with resources expected to meet the demands of the Interstate Air Quality Rule (IAQR) installations. Factors such as modular construction methods and non-union labor will reduce the need for union boilermakers. The availability of resources for completing the projected IAQR and control installation for 2010 and 2015 is not expected to be limited. Factors such as modular construction methods and non-union labor will reduce the demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker unions, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be sufficient boilermaker capacity to meet the requirements, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. The assumption of limited boilermaker availability only affects certain scenarios analyzed by the EPA. The EPA's benchmark analysis includes a demand elasticity function in the base case scenario. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimates due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply. EPA's natural gas supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves, which may be more representative of future supplies. In the current market climate, the EIA curves may be more representative of future supplies than EPA's estimates. The analysis uses the Demand Response Scenario as the basis, with Clear Skies costing less than other bills in both short- and long-term. Clear Skies has less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs compared to other approaches. The provisions for Hg are weak, and there are no provisions for CO2. The Clear Skies bill has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. Its benefits are substantially less than the Carper and Jeffords bills, with lower annual benefits of $6 billion in 2010. Clear Skies' required pollution caps are less stringent, resulting in lower benefits compared to the other bills. EPA compares the effects of the three bills to a baseline that does not include current Clean Air Act requirements. The EPA compares the effects of the three bills to a baseline that does not include current Clean Air Act requirements. Clear Skies has minimal incremental cost and benefits, while Senator Jeffords' bill has the greatest benefits, exceeding those of the other bills in both 2010 and 2020. In 2020, the benefits of S. 150 exceed those of other bills, estimated at $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. The Jeffords bill would be the most costly, with constraints on scrubber installations leading to coal-fired power plant shutdowns and a 40% reduction in coal production and generation. The Jeffords bill would significantly reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to the need for a substantial increase in renewable fuel generators at a high cost. It would result in an additional 65 gigawatts of renewable energy generation and nearly 100 gigawatts of oil- and gas-fired capacity. The bill is seen as costly but offers greater net benefits compared to other options like Clear Skies and the Carper bill. EPA analysis shows that the benefits and costs of the Carper bill are lower than the Jeffords bill but higher than Clear Skies, aiming for substantial emission reductions while allowing time to avoid immediate price increases. The Jeffords bill aims to reduce coal production and increase renewable energy generation, with higher costs but greater benefits compared to other options. The bill allows for a phased-in schedule to avoid immediate price increases and includes a limited CO2 requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various variables, including price elasticity and construction constraints, to assess the impact of different scenarios on electricity growth and natural gas supply. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on price elasticity and construction constraints to assess their impact on electricity growth and natural gas supply. Different scenarios were considered, including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, which removed short-term construction constraints but included zero demand price elasticity. This scenario had a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, with a 36% short-term increase and a 157% long-term increase. The removal of any price elasticity in the EPA Base Case Scenario significantly increases the costs of S. 150, with a 63% increase in 2010 and a 147% increase in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. For S. 843, removal of price elasticity results in an 86% higher cost estimate in 2010. Demand response and construction constraint assumptions heavily influence these cost estimates. The third alternative scenario, Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario, combines zero demand response with higher electricity growth and tighter natural gas supply, leading to increased costs, especially for S. 150. This scenario shows that demand response and construction constraints heavily influence cost estimates for S. 843 in the short term, but have little effect in the long term or for the Managers' Mark. The impact of higher growth and natural gas costs on S.150 is more pronounced compared to S.843 and the Managers' Mark. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly affects cost estimates for S.150 in both short and long term. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability is needed for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumptions also affect S.843, but the effects decrease over the long term. The construction constraints have a significant effect on S. 843 in the short term, which decreases over the long term. EPA's assumptions have little effect on cost estimates. S. 150 and S. 843 aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with different caps. The EPA estimates that the costs for CO2 allowances under S. 843 are significantly lower compared to S. 150, which aligns more with the Kyoto Protocol requirements. The estimated costs for carbon dioxide reduction range from $19 per metric ton in 2010 to $33 per metric ton in 2020. This falls within the current European Union market prices as they work towards meeting their 8% reduction target below 1990 levels. EPA did not develop new data on control technologies due to time constraints. The study did not develop new data on the cost of control technologies, relying on assumptions from 2005. The analysis may overstate the cost of mercury emission controls, with advancements in technology since 2003. The cost of activated carbon injection controls is now one-fourth of 2003 estimates. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843, with human health effects being the main benefits. EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis show benefits outweighing costs for S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. The analysis does not attempt to monetize environmental benefits, such as the significant effects of SO2 emissions on acid deposition and regional haze, as well as the widespread fish consumption advisories due to mercury deposition. The analysis did not monetize environmental benefits like regional haze formation and fish consumption advisories due to mercury deposition. It also did not model mercury health effects or estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which could understate the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is more aggressive in controlling CO2 compared to Clear Skies, which does not cap CO2 emissions. EPA's analysis shows little cost and small benefits for Clear Skies after adjusting for rules. In contrast, the Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards with benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on reduction amounts and schedules, while mercury control costs depend on timely data. EPA's analysis does not reflect current data on mercury control costs. The EPA's analysis of mercury control costs is outdated and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. The analysis does not consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs, and is based on 2003 assumptions, making it outdated for congressional debate."
