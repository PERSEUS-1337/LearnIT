    "content": "The \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" is established in response to the devastating 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and the potential seismic threat along the west coast of the United States. Scientists predict a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major earthquake and tsunami in the next 50 years, highlighting the need for preparedness in coastal communities. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking necessary resources. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or greater likelihood within 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with emergency services providers. The emergency management department receiving a grant can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for tsunami education. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. Eligibility for grants under this Act is based on the population served by the emergency management department, with varying percentages of non-Federal funds required based on population size. In-kind contributions can also be considered for up to 50 percent of the non-Federal share of project costs. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT. The Director will assess if grant-receiving emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant award. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning, preparing, and managing emergencies or disasters. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 authorized annually from 2007 to 2012 for the Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program under the Department of Homeland Security. 5% may be reserved for administrative costs, and funds remain available until expended."
