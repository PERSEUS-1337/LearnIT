    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the importance of the Foothill Feeder below Castaic Dam as a primary water conduit for the Southern California region served by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This district, consisting of 26 member public agencies, provides water to approximately 19 million people across multiple counties. Water supplies from the State Water Project are crucial for municipal and industrial uses, and any disruption must be minimized to ensure a reliable water supply. The Foothill Feeder is essential for providing water to Southern California. Dewatering activities may impact the unarmored threespine stickleback, requiring permits for incidental take. Consultation with wildlife agencies is necessary for mitigation measures. Section 2081.10 of the Fish and Game Code addresses these concerns. Section 2081.10 of the Fish and Game Code allows for the incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback during maintenance of the Metropolitan Water District's Foothill Feeder water supply facility in Southern California, subject to specific conditions and conservation standards. The department ensures that all necessary measures are taken to meet conservation standards for the unarmored threespine stickleback. A biologist with experience in evaluating impacts on inland fisheries must be present during activities that may affect the species. The Metropolitan Water District consults with the department to minimize incidental take of the stickleback. Feasible measures are considered to avoid impacts on the species. The take authorization covers incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback during activities related to the Foothill Feeder in specified locations. It also includes mitigation actions required in the permit and adaptive management plans. The permit issued for the Foothill Feeder project includes conditions for handling stranded fish, dewatering the feeder, and mimicking streamflows. The conditions must comply with the project description and environmental impact report. This section does not exempt the periodic maintenance of the Foothill Feeder from other laws. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must report to the department after every dewatering of the Foothill Feeder to ensure compliance with permit conditions and effectiveness of the conservation plan for the unarmored threespine stickleback. Modifications to the feeder cannot increase its water delivery capacity. The department may authorize the taking of a fully protected fish for scientific research purposes, including efforts to recover threatened or endangered species. Notification will be published for affected parties to provide relevant information within 30 days. Affected and interested parties have 30 days after notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register to provide relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization. The Fish and Game Code specifies fully protected fish species that require a permit for possession. Scientific research excludes actions for project mitigation. (a) (1) Fully protected fish cannot be taken or possessed, except for authorized scientific research purposes. The department must notify affected parties and solicit comments before authorizing the take of a fully protected fish. Affected and interested parties have 30 days to provide information and comments on the proposed authorization after notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register.

Affected and interested parties have 30 days to provide information and comments on the proposed authorization after notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Fully protected fish under a permit issued by the department include Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is being amended.

Section 4 of the bill outlines conditions for the incorporation of proposed amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code from Assembly Bills 1845 and 2001. The operative status of the amendments is contingent on the enactment and effective dates of both bills before January 1, 2017, and the non-enactment or non-amendment of Section 5515 by the other bill. If this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 1845, certain sections of this bill will not become operative. Similarly, if this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 2001, other sections will not become operative. Section 3.3 of the bill includes amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code from Assembly Bills 1845 and 2001. It will only take effect if all three bills are enacted by January 1, 2017, and if this bill is enacted after the other two bills."
