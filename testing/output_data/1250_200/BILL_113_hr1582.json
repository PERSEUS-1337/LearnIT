    "content": "The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing energy-related rules costing over $1 billion if they will have significant adverse effects on the economy. Prior reports and determinations are required before finalizing such rules. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, and data relied upon for estimates. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, and data relied upon for estimates. The report must include a certification that all data and documents used in developing estimates have been preserved and are available for public review on the Agency's website. It should also estimate the increases in energy prices and describe the employment effects that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with relevant agencies, will analyze the impacts of the rule on energy prices, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and energy supply. This analysis will assess potential adverse effects on energy distribution and use, including any shortfall in supply and increased reliance on foreign sources. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will assess the rule's impact on energy supply, distribution, and use, including any adverse effects such as a shortfall in supply and increased reliance on foreign sources. If adverse effects are determined, a subsequent evaluation on the rule's significant impacts on the economy will be conducted. The Secretary of Energy will assess the rule's impact on energy supply, distribution, and use, including economic indicators like GDP, unemployment, wages, consumer prices, and business activity. Results will be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
