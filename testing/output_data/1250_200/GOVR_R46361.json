    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and summarizes the budgetary context of the legislation. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. The bill covers major components of the budget request, including weapons acquisition programs. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides $687.8 billion for DOD, which is $2.86 billion less than President Trump requested. The bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or TRICARE for Life program. DOD has organized its budget requests post-9/11 to designate funding for specific activities. Since 2009, non-base budget funds for U.S. armed forces have been designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to cover activities related to post-9/11 attacks. The OCO designation allows for additional funding beyond the defense spending cap set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. In the FY2020 budget, $97.9 billion was designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the cap of $576.2 billion for defense spending. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill included $97.9 billion designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the cap to $666.5 billion. Separate versions of the bill were reported by the House and Senate committees, with a compromise version agreed upon and passed by both chambers. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill, including $97.9 billion for OCO funding, was incorporated into H.R. 1158 and passed by both chambers. The bill reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, focusing on increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. This marks a change from past U.S. national security policy, emphasizing competition between nuclear-armed powers. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. policies focused on regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, as well as recalibrating relations with China and Russia. Post-9/11, the focus shifted to countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East, while also addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. The events in Moscow and China's militarization of the South China Sea highlighted the importance of competing with great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. Challenges from the end of the Cold War, such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, continue to pose serious threats. Adversaries are collaborating and blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict, making it more difficult to prioritize and manage these complex security issues. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, focusing on countering their military capabilities and bolstering the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. The strategy acknowledges the erosion of U.S. forces' advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese and Russian threats and emphasizes the need to assume vigorous contestation of military objectives. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, focusing on countering their military capabilities. The new orientation for U.S. strategy is sometimes referred to as a \"2+3\" strategy, meaning countering two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs being the fastest-growing segment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion, with sequestration as enforcement. Caps on defense-related spending apply to DOD and defense activities, but not emergency or OCO funding. Congress has raised the spending caps through legislation. The Administration's FY2020 budget request adhered to the defense spending cap, but included $165 billion in OCO funding. The House and Senate Committees treated all funding for base budget purposes as part of the base budget request. P.L. 116-93 funded a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but reduced the Army's end-strength by 7,500 due to not meeting goals in FY2018. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funded a 3.1% increase in military basic pay, allocated $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, and provided $3.0 million for a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. Additionally, the act reduced the Army's end-strength by 7,500 and funded a reduction in the end-strength of the Selected Reserve. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) allocated $110 million for DOD's childcare program, supporting roughly 23,000 employees attending to nearly 200,000 children. The act also supported the modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons as a top priority for the Department of Defense. The FY2020 budget prioritized the modernization of the nuclear triad, including hypersonic long-range missiles. DOD has been focusing on developing hypersonic weapons since the early 2000s, with increased funding to accelerate the program due to advancements by China and Russia. Congress supported the FY2020 DOD budget request for hypersonic weapons development. The FY2020 DOD budget request and enacted defense appropriations bill supported the U.S. hypersonic program, allocating additional funds for defenses against hypersonic missiles. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. The budget also aimed to strengthen defenses against ballistic missile attacks, including ICBMs and shorter-range missiles. The FY2020 DOD budget request and enacted defense appropriations bill supported the U.S. hypersonic program and allocated additional funds for defenses against hypersonic missiles. The missile defense budget request reflected recommendations of the Administration's Missile Defense Review. P.L. 116-93 shifted funds among components to defend U.S. territory against ICBMs, including developing an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill supported the U.S. hypersonic program and allocated additional funds for defenses against hypersonic missiles. The bill also approved funding for military space satellites, satellite launches, and the newly created Space Force. Additionally, the bill supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including increasing the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including increasing the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon. The bill also proposed reallocating funds from planned upgrades to legacy systems to invest in the development of new combat capabilities. This included cutting $223.0 million from Bradley upgrades, labeled as \"excess to need.\" The enacted FY2020 defense appropriations bill provided nearly triple the amount requested for Chinook upgrades, allocating $46.2 million instead of $18.2 million. The bill also reined in the Army's third attempt in 20 years to develop a replacement for the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, allocating $205.6 million of the $378.4 million requested for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program. The program was criticized for being too technologically ambitious to be managed under a streamlined acquisition process. The Army's plan to develop a replacement for the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was criticized for being too ambitious for a streamlined acquisition process. After the enactment of P.L. 116-93, the Army canceled the OMFV contracting plan and restarted with new design parameters. The budget request for major aviation programs of all armed forces was generally supported by the act, but potential disagreements between Congress and the Army were indicated by the insistence on continuing the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The Army had initially projected a $46.4 million request for procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s, but the amended FY2020 request was reduced to $18.2 million. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s, with the Army deciding to truncate the planned procurement. Additionally, $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address the Air Force's fighter strength gap due to delays in the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter fielding. Some funds were shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request was supported to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The FY2020 defense bill supported the Navy's shipbuilding budget request to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The bill included funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships, as well as modifications to Virginia-class submarines. Additionally, funds were allocated for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings. The FY2020 defense bill provided $1.2 billion for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units. It also included funds for storing and launching additional Tomahawk missiles or other payloads.
