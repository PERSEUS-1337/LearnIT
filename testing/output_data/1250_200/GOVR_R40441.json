    "content": "The Navy conducted training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar, which environmentalists claimed harmed whales. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Environmental groups sought relief, leading to a preliminary injunction granted by the district court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction with modified mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction with modified mitigation measures, citing a \"possibility\" of irreparable injury for environmental groups challenging Navy training exercises. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show irreparable injury is \"likely\" and that the Navy's interest in training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals, reversing the decision below. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, citing national security interests in Navy training exercises. The lawsuit's merits regarding violations of environmental laws were not addressed. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a likely irreparable injury for injunctions and rejected the Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test. The Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions was rejected by the Supreme Court, emphasizing the need for likely irreparable injury. Forest Service regulations under the ARA were challenged in a timber sale case, where notice, comment, and appeals were precluded for projects covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. The Ninth Circuit invalidated Forest Service regulations in a timber sale case, citing deprivation of procedural rights and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests as grounds for standing. The court found the regulations conflicted with the ARA and upheld a nationwide injunction against their enforcement. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the issues raised. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the Forest Service regulations' enforcement, standing of environmental groups, ripeness of challenges, and the Ninth Circuit's nationwide injunction. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 8, 2008, but a decision is pending. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, making the outcome significant. Groups have long used site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, with the stakes in this decision potentially large. A defeat for these groups could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate a government program. The Clean Water Act addresses the issue of power plants and industrial operations withdrawing water from waterways, resulting in harm to aquatic organisms. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) requires cooling water intake structures at power plants to use the best technology available to minimize environmental impact. In Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, cost-benefit analysis was invalidated for BTA selection under section 316(b). EPA can consider industry's ability to bear costs and do cost-effectiveness analysis, but not cost-benefit analysis. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the \"best technology available\" for cooling water intake structures. The case will test the justices' views on cost-benefit analysis and business concerns. The Supreme Court case will test the justices' views on cost-benefit analysis and business concerns, particularly in relation to the Clean Water Act. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest, with plans to dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, potentially impacting aquatic life. Justice Breyer's past criticism of government regulation for not considering costs enough may play a role in the decision. Coeur Alaska planned to dispose of wastewater from a gold mine into a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life and raise the lake bottom by 50 feet. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations raised legal challenges. EPA's new source performance standard prohibited such discharges from Coeur Alaska's type of ore processing. The EPA's new source performance standard prohibits discharges from Coeur Alaska's ore processing into US waters. The court ruled that this standard must be applied through an NPDES permit, and that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material under Section 404. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008 to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to EPA. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a potential reversal could be significant, as it may give the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for a contaminated site. In a lawsuit involving a contaminated site, the EPA and state sued past and present owners, operators, and those responsible for hazardous substance disposal. The district court found railroads and Shell Oil liable for a percentage of cleanup costs. The Ninth Circuit addressed whether they are liable for all cleanup costs or only some. The court held that the railroads and Shell may be liable for cleanup costs, but apportionment of the harm is necessary. Shell was found liable as an \"arranger\" under broader liability, as the transaction involved disposal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 1, 2008 to address arranger liability under CERCLA. The case questions whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer for merely selling a product that later causes contamination. Joint and several liability under CERCLA is also at issue. The case was argued on February 24, 2009. The Supreme Court case Burlington Northern raises important Superfund Act issues regarding liability apportionment and the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. The case questions what constitutes a reasonable basis for apportioning liability, which could impact the government's ability to recover costs through court awards or settlements. The Supreme Court case Burlington Northern raises important Superfund Act issues regarding liability apportionment and the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If the Court adopts a lax standard for finding a reasonable basis, the federal treasury may have to absorb more cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products. The cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. The Supreme Court cases accepted are crucial for their programs and may indicate the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. Industry is worried about liability in product sales. The environmental community is concerned about the outcome of five cases, especially since they won in the lower courts. The Ninth Circuit, where four cases are from, has a high reversal rate in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has historically ruled against environmental positions in NEPA cases. Today's Supreme Court is generally less supportive of regulation and more sympathetic to business interests. The Supreme Court, with a few exceptions, is less supportive of regulation and more sympathetic to business interests compared to the 1970s and 1980s. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random certiorari-granting processes or conservative justices wanting to address issues before potential changes in the Court. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also showing more interest in environmental cases. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including the question of liability in product sales. The Supreme Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, with the Court turning down the majority of petitions for certiorari. In the case of Rapanos v. United States, the Court's nonacceptance is likely due to the lack of a majority rationale in the previous decision, leading to confusion in lower courts."
