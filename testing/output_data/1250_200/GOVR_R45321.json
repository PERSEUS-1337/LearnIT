    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, while the Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion. The House committee bill for the Department of Transportation (DOT) is slightly above the FY2018 amount and significantly higher than the Administration request. Most of DOT's funding comes from trust funds, with a small portion being discretionary authority. The Senate bill may result in a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to FY2018. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives most of its funding from two large trust funds, the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which typically provide around 90% of its annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding, changing the funding proportion. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget with primary expenditures not in grants. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives funding from trust funds, with reauthorizations of taxes supporting these funds being significant. Funding for highway, transit, and rail programs is authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased to $86 billion in FY2018, but inflation-adjusted funding has fluctuated over the years. In FY2016 and FY2017, DOT's inflation-adjusted funding was lower than in FY2006. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, supported by the federal motor fuels excise tax. The fund has faced a shortfall, with expenditures exceeding revenues. Congress transferred $143 billion to the fund from the general Treasury fund during FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, contributing to the fund's shortfall. The Highway Trust Fund receives a fixed amount per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, regardless of the fuel cost. Inflation and increased fuel efficiency have reduced the fund's purchasing power. The Congressional Budget Office predicts stagnant gasoline consumption through 2024 due to improved vehicle efficiency. This will result in annual revenues of $39-41 billion, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018, with a recommendation of $750 million from the House Committee on Appropriations. The Transportation grants for FY2018, previously known as the TIGER grant program, are recommended at $750 million by the House Committee on Appropriations and $1 billion by the Senate-passed bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations prohibits the use of federal share requested as a criterion for project selection and directs the use of selection criteria from the FY2016 grant process. The TIGER grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution. The discretionary grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution by funding projects with national or regional impacts. An example is the Amtrak's Gateway Program, which includes replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The project costs fall largely on New York and New Jersey, despite benefiting passengers along the Northeast Corridor. The BUILD program provides grants for transportation projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with funding going more towards regional and metropolitan projects. Congress supports the program through annual DOT appropriations, but it is oversubscribed with applications exceeding available funding. Critics have raised concerns about the equitable distribution of funds across geographic areas and transportation modes. The TIGER grant program, funded through annual DOT appropriations, is oversubscribed with applications exceeding available funding. Critics have raised concerns about funding distribution, leading Congress to allocate a portion of funding to rural areas. In FY2019, 33% of recommended funding is designated for rural projects, with additional allocations for seaports and urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern in recent years where the Obama Administration requested more funding than Congress provided, leading to cuts proposed by the House. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding but Congress funded the program. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the program. The Essential Air Service program in the United States is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the program in FY2019, which is $62 million less than the previous year. The House committee bill recommended $175 million in discretionary funding, while the Senate-passed bill also recommends the same amount. This funding increase would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The EAS program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008, partly due to new communities being added as airlines reduce routes. Congress made changes to the program in 2012 to limit new entrants and cap per-passenger subsidies. The Essential Air Service program in the United States was changed in 2012 to limit new entrants and cap per-passenger subsidies. Supporters argue that the program preserves airline service to small communities and promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger and the proximity of some airports receiving subsidies to major airports. In 2008, Congress mandated railroads to install positive train control (PTC) to prevent incidents caused by operator error. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required tracks were not compliant by the 2015 deadline. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020. Funding has been provided by Congress in recent years, but the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The Senate-passed bill does not allocate a specific amount for PTC projects, but the committee report directs DOT to prioritize PTC projects in making grants from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, authorizing three new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak, with no funding requested for the three grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided minimal funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for FY2009 and FY2010 when $10.5 billion was allocated for high-speed rail grants. Funding for intercity passenger rail development was absent from FY2011 to FY2016, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes roughly $13 billion to state and local transit agencies through various formula-based programs. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as New Starts, is the largest discretionary transit grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit projects with total costs over $300 million. The Capital Investment Grants program has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. There is also an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over years, with the Trump Administration requesting $1.0 billion for FY2019, $1.6 billion less than FY2018. The Administration's FY2019 request for the Capital Investment Grants program is $1.6 billion less than FY2018. Congress has expressed concern over the Administration's stance on funding transit projects, as it believes state and local governments should bear the responsibility without federal assistance. Congress has not supported the Administration's proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects. Congress has not supported the Administration's proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects. Funding for the CIG program in FY2018 and FY2019 exceeded FTA requests, with Congress directing FTA to advance eligible projects despite FTA's non-compliance with congressional directives. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over FTA's delays in project development. Transportation for America accuses FTA of causing delays in transit project development by withholding grants and prolonging the review process, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. FTA denies these claims and states that it is not intentionally delaying project reviews. Congress has directed FTA to advance eligible projects despite concerns over delays in project development. In FY2018, the federal share limit for New Starts projects was lowered to 51%. The House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision limiting the federal share to 50%, while the Senate-passed bill does not have such a provision. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates believe that requiring a higher local match for New Starts projects allows FTA to support more projects and encourages careful cost estimation and project planning. The challenges of funding transportation infrastructure include the distribution of federal funding by mode and states, making it difficult for projects involving multiple modes to receive significant amounts of funding. This situation is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, which aims to increase rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2017 funded at $68 million. The largest rail grant program in recent years had limited funding, with $68 million allocated in FY2017 and $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion in FY2018, but competition for funding is intense. An agreement was previously reached for cost-sharing on the new Hudson Tunnel, but the Trump Administration does not feel bound by it. Congress would need to provide the necessary funding. Neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committees mentioned the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 THUD committee reports. The Appropriations Committees recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs in FY2019, including $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital projects, with additional funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted that the FY2018 grant was the final installment of a $1.5 billion commitment made in 2008. The Administration requested $120 million for WMATA in FY2019, with the House recommending $150 million. The Administration requested $120 million for WMATA in FY2019, while the House Appropriations Committee and Senate-passed bill recommended $150 million. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA faces maintenance backlog and safety concerns, with FTA restricting federal funds due to mismanagement. An FTA audit in 2015 led to recommendations for safety practice changes, with FTA assuming oversight from the Tri-State Oversight Committee in October 2015. In 2015, FTA took over safety oversight of WMATA from the Tri-State Oversight Committee, making recommendations for safety improvements. FTA conducts inspections, leads accident investigations, and ensures federal funds are used for safety. In 2017, FTA withheld 5% of FY2017 transit funds until a new safety oversight agency (Metrorail Safety Commission) was established. The Commission must be operational for FTA to release funding. In 2018, FTA outlined steps for the Commission to take over oversight responsibilities. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends assigning oversight of WMATA's rail operations to FRA instead of FTA. Congress would need to grant FRA authority for this transition."
