    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various proposed actions, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing instead on voluntary initiatives to curb greenhouse gas growth. The 2002 Climate Action Report (CAR) submitted under the UNFCCC focused on regulatory programs that aimed to achieve energy or environmental goals, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and enact market-oriented reduction programs similar to the current acid rain reduction program. The 2002 Climate Action Report focused on regulatory programs for greenhouse gas reduction. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to enact market-oriented reduction programs similar to the current acid rain reduction program. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through flexible, market-based mechanisms. The bill S.342 aims to encourage innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies, sequester carbon emissions, and mitigate climate change effects. It includes emission reduction provisions similar to past amendments but has faced previous defeats in Congress. The bill requires economy-wide reductions through market-based strategies, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. It excludes certain sources of greenhouse gases and facilities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment is based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's call for a mandatory, economy-wide tradeable permit system. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman, based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendations, mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would be through a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The initial price for such payments would be $7 a ton in 2010. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" allowing covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions at a price of $7 a ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity through a market-oriented allowance trading program. The proposal differs from S. 1151 by focusing on emissions intensity reduction rather than absolute caps on emissions. Economic growth will determine if total U.S. emissions grow or decline under this proposal. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE. S. 1151 does not limit the price per allowance, and the proposals differ in coverage, agency responsibility, and allowance proceeds utilization. Emission reduction estimates have uncertainty, with EIA's analysis showing a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions under S. 1151. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 in 2004, predicting a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. However, this would not bring emissions back to 2000 or 1990 levels. CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction in emissions for the same period. Both options would likely see continued emissions growth, albeit at a slower rate than business-as-usual. Emissions not covered by S. 1151 would increase, while covered emissions under the draft amendment would grow with economic expansion. The draft amendment would lead to emissions continuing to grow as economic growth outpaces the reduction in carbon intensity. This could result in emissions rising faster than under S. 1151. The estimates for emissions under the draft amendment and S. 1151 are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements. The draft amendment's estimated emission reductions are more uncertain than under S. 1151 due to uncertainties surrounding the number of covered entities. Higher coverage in S. 1151 results in more reductions but lower compliance costs, while lower coverage leads to greater uncertainty. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emission reductions compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment has uncertainties in emission reductions due to uncertainties in GDP growth and carbon intensity projections. The estimated emission reductions are more uncertain compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment raises questions about its coverage and uncertainties in achieving emission reductions, particularly regarding the safety valve. The projected cost under the draft amendment is more uncertain compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment and S. 1151 both face uncertainties in achieving emission reductions, with S. 1151 having more uncertainty in projected costs due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are affected by various uncertainties, with differing estimates on potential permit prices in 2010. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors like energy efficiency improvements and natural gas supply compared to S. 1151. It incorporates economic growth into emissions targets, allowing for some increase in emissions if economic growth exceeds improvements in greenhouse gas intensity. This results in lower costs due to fewer required offsets. The draft amendment's projected cost is also influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures. The draft amendment's projected cost is influenced by factors like energy efficiency improvements and natural gas supply. It does not include international credits like S. 1151, reducing uncertainty and potential costs. The safety valve limits the upside risk to $7 a ton, narrowing the cost uncertainty to $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars. The draft amendment's safety valve limits costs to $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars, narrowing uncertainty. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. The preference for a pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of a safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received. A pure tradeable permit program may be appropriate for those confident in achieving a specific level of CO2 reduction, while including a safety valve may be more suitable for those concerned about potential control costs to the economy. The efficiency of a tradeable permit program lies in the trading of permits, concentrating emission reduction efforts at least cost sources. The safety valve approach in the draft amendment caps the marginal cost of CO2 control, leading to uncertainty in emission reductions. It is compared to a contingent carbon tax, with a focus on economic costs and uncertainty. S. 1151 leans towards total emissions control, while the draft amendment leans towards price control in market-based systems. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with S. 1151 establishing an absolute cap on emissions and the draft amendment limiting emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is likely to result in larger and more certain emission reductions, while the draft amendment is expected to have lower and more predictable costs. Both proposals would lead to lower U.S. emissions compared to business as usual, but total emissions would still increase, albeit at a slower rate."
