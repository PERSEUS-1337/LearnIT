    "content": "The \"Fitness Integrated Into Teaching Kids Act\" or the \"FIT Kids Act\" amends the Carol M. White Physical Education Program to award grants for physical education programs for kindergarten through 12th-grade students. The FIT Kids Act allocates funds for grants to local educational agencies, community-based organizations, and states for physical education programs. 25% of funds exceeding $75,000,000 are reserved for state grants on a competitive basis. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies and community-based organizations for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, staff training, fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive development. The physical education program aims to enhance students' physical, mental, and social development through activities promoting lifelong healthy habits, social skills, and nutrition education. Professional development opportunities for teachers are provided to stay updated on research and trends. Extracurricular activities like team sports are not considered part of the program. Local educational agencies and community-based organizations must submit applications for grants to the Secretary. Each local educational agency or community-based organization seeking a grant must submit an application outlining plans to enhance physical education programs to meet State standards. Private school, home-schooled students, parents, and teachers can participate in funded activities. An annual report detailing conducted activities is required for continued funding. Local educational agencies or community-based organizations must submit an annual report to the Secretary, describing activities and progress towards meeting State physical education standards. Administrative expenses are limited to 5% of grant funds, and the Federal share of program costs is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Grants should be distributed equitably among urban and rural areas. A report to Congress is required within 2 years. The Secretary will report to Congress within 2 years after awarding the first grant, detailing the programs' success in improving physical fitness and making recommendations for their continuation and enhancement. \"SEC. 5505. GRANTS TO STATES.\" The Secretary is authorized to award grants to States for comprehensive programs addressing physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition based on research and needs analysis. States must submit applications detailing needs and improvement plans. The Secretary can award grants to States for programs focusing on physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition. States must submit plans for improving these areas, including implementing a measurement system, ensuring data quality, and coordinating activities with other programs. Federal and State programs aim to expand learning time, provide before- and after-school programming, align activities with other funding sources, and address diverse geographic needs. States receiving grants must reserve up to 5% for program administration. The grant funds shall reserve up to 5% for program administration, technical assistance, and teacher development. The remaining funds will be used to award subgrants to eligible local applicants. States must establish a physical education requirement and implement a statewide measurement system to track progress. The grant funds are used to measure progress, provide public reports, award subgrants, address school and student needs, and offer professional development in physical and health education. The State must establish a reporting system to measure physical fitness, education, student health, and nutrition at the local level. This includes tracking time spent on physical education and vigorous activity, adherence to curriculum standards, and guidelines from the CDC. The local educational agency must report on the number of licensed physical education teachers, presence of school health councils, and square footage of facilities used for physical education. The State must compile statistics on physical education facilities, ensure uniform data collection procedures, collect data annually, and use the data for planning and improvement. Subgrantees may collect additional locally defined indicators aligned with program objectives. The State awards subgrants to eligible local applicants based on need, size, and scope to promote physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition. Applicants must submit applications to the State, with priority given to comprehensive programs. The State awards subgrants based on need and priority to promote physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition in schools with high poverty levels. Subgrantees must implement programs identified through the State's measurement system. The subgrants awarded by the State prioritize promoting physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition in schools with high poverty levels. Subgrantees must implement programs based on scientifically valid research and collect data for schools served. Additionally, policies to expand access to quality physical activity opportunities must be established, considering the unique needs of the schools. The National School Lunch Act requires States receiving grants to submit annual reports on fund usage, considering the needs of students with disabilities and English learners. Funds under this subpart must supplement, not replace, other Federal, State, or local funds for physical education activities."
