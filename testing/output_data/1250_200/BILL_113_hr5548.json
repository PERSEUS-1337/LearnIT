The Act defines \"clean technology\" as technologies that produce energy from renewable sources, improve energy transmission and storage efficiency, enhance energy efficiency for buildings and industry, enable Smart Grid development, and produce advanced materials with energy applications. The Act defines \"clean technology\" as technologies that produce energy from renewable sources, improve energy transmission and storage efficiency, enhance energy efficiency for buildings and industry, enable Smart Grid development, and produce advanced materials with energy applications. It also includes activities related to advanced manufacturing that involve information, automation, computation, software, sensing, networking, and cutting-edge materials. The term \"cluster\" refers to a network of entities involved in clean technologies and advanced manufacturing, while a \"consortium\" is a clean technology consortium established under the Act. A \"project\" is defined as an activity within this context. The term \"project\" in the context of a technology consortium established under the Act refers to an activity supported by the consortium. A \"qualifying entity\" eligible for support includes research universities, Federal or State institutions focusing on clean technologies, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in translational research, clean technology, or cluster development. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, and \"translational research\" involves coordinating research with technical applications for commercial use. The Clean Technology Consortia Program is established under SEC. 3. Eligible entities include research universities, Federal or State institutions, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in clean technology. The Secretary of Commerce oversees the program. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote domestic development of state-of-the-art technologies. The program will leverage expertise from various sectors to support research, development, and commercial application of clean technologies. The Secretary will oversee all aspects of the program and select grant recipients. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to oversee the program, select grant recipients, and coordinate innovation activities with other entities. The consortia will promote new innovative clean technologies. The consortia will promote new innovative clean technologies, expand manufacturing capabilities, create jobs, provide assistance to companies investing in clean technologies, and equip small- and medium-sized enterprises for change. The consortia aim to equip small- and medium-sized enterprises with the capacity to adopt new clean technologies, accelerate investment in clean technologies through partnerships, encourage collaboration between emerging and established clean technology enterprises, and demonstrate a successful model for commercialization of clean technologies. The section on applications outlines the goals of the consortia in promoting the adoption and investment in clean technologies. To receive a grant under this Act, a consortium must submit an application with necessary information. Eligibility requires the consortium to consist of research universities with clean technology research budget and other qualifying entities with expertise in translational research. The consortium must have a binding agreement outlining partnership structure, governance, and conflicts-of-interest policy. The consortium applying for a grant must have a conflicts-of-interest policy, an accounting structure meeting requirements, an external advisory committee, funding from non-Federal sources, be part of a cluster or show potential to develop one, and operate as a nonprofit or public-private partnership. The consortium applying for a grant must have an external advisory committee consisting of members with relevant expertise to review and ensure projects meet conflicts-of-interest policies. The consortium must have an external advisory committee with members from the consortium, industry representatives, and the Secretary as a member for grants under this Act. The text chunk \"SEC. 5. GRANTS.\" is a concise statement regarding grants. The Secretary awards grants to consortia on a competitive basis for up to 5 years, extendable for another 5 years. Grants are capped at $30,000,000 per year or the total non-Federal contributions. Factors considered include research capacity, resources, and consortium affiliation. A consortium awarded a grant under this Act must use the funds for translational research, technology development, manufacturing innovation, and commercialization activities related to clean technology. The consortium must also develop and publish project plans, criteria, and terms for project awards on the Department of Commerce website. The consortium awarded a grant under this Act must use funds for translational research, technology development, manufacturing innovation, and commercialization activities related to clean technology. They must establish policies to prevent resources from displacing private sector investment, facilitate participation of private entities investing in clean technologies, and oversee project solicitations and selection for awards. The consortium awarded a grant under this Act must use funds for translational research, technology development, manufacturing innovation, and commercialization activities related to clean technology. They must oversee project solicitations, review proposed projects, select projects for awards, and monitor project implementation. A consortium may use up to 10 percent of the grant for administrative expenses and is prohibited from using the funds to construct new buildings or facilities. Additionally, the consortium must conduct annual audits to ensure compliance with the grant requirements and submit audit reports to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States. The Secretary has the authority to review and revoke grants awarded under the Act if a consortium misuses funds. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress including audits and recommendations. $100,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section."
