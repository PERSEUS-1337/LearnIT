    "content": "The Hague Adoption Convention, approved in 1993 by 66 nations, aims to protect the rights of adopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents in intercountry adoptions. It requires signatory countries to establish a Central Authority for adoptions and ensures cooperation among countries for international adoptions. The Convention also emphasizes the recognition of adoptions certified through its provisions. The Hague Adoption Convention, approved in 1993, entered into force in 75 countries by May 1, 1995. The United States ratified the Convention on December 12, 2007, and it became effective on April 1, 2008. To be fully operative, countries must sign, ratify domestically, and file approval with the depository in the Netherlands. The US became a signatory on March 31, 1994, and the Senate approved ratification on September 20, 2000. The United States Senate advised and consented to ratify the Hague Adoption Convention on September 20, 2000. Two specific qualifications were provided, including approval of adoption service providers and the requirement for implementing legislation. The International Adoption Act of 2000 was passed by the Senate on September 20, 2000, and signed into law by President Clinton on October 6, 2000, establishing the framework for implementing the Convention's provisions. The United States ratified the Hague Adoption Convention in 2000, establishing a framework for adoption services. The U.S. Department of State oversees administrative functions under the Convention, including accrediting agencies. Regulations were published in 2006 for adoption service providers and record preservation. The U.S. Department of State outlined extensive preparations required for implementing the Hague Adoption Convention, including establishing a Central Authority, promulgating regulations for accrediting entities, setting standards for adoption agencies, and creating a case-tracking system for intercountry adoptions. The U.S. Department of State completed preparations for implementing the Hague Adoption Convention in late 2007. The Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs deposited the U.S. instrument of ratification at a ceremony in The Hague on December 12, 2007, making the United States a full member of the Hague. Maura Harty deposited the United States' instrument of ratification of the Hague Adoption Convention in The Hague, making the US a full member. The Department of State has ongoing responsibilities for intercountry adoption under the Convention, requiring annual reports to Congress. Prior to Convention implementation, adoptions in the US were governed by state law only. Compliance with the Convention now involves coordination between state and federal authorities to meet treaty obligations. The United States became a full member of the Hague Adoption Convention on April 1, 2008, governing intercountry adoptions with other member countries. The Department of State (DOS) has various oversight and reporting duties related to the implementation of the Convention, maintaining a comprehensive website to track progress."
