    "content": "The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003\" is introduced as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code, providing a tax credit for affordable housing preservation. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 introduces a tax credit for affordable housing preservation. The credit is determined by the preservation allocation amount from a qualified preservation sale, limited to the gain recognized by the taxpayer. The preservation allocation amount is the amount allocated to the taxpayer by a housing credit agency, not exceeding the maximum rate tax multiplied by the gain from the sale. The term 'qualified preservation sale' refers to a sale or exchange of eligible multifamily housing property to a preservation entity that agrees to maintain affordability and use restrictions. These restrictions must be legally enforceable, consistent with the long-term viability of affordable housing, and recorded as a restrictive covenant on the property. The term 'eligible multifamily housing property' includes properties assisted under various housing acts and those with low-income housing tax credits. These properties must have affordability restrictions recorded as a restrictive covenant. The term 'affordable housing' refers to housing that is a qualified low-income housing project. The 'extended use period' is the period after sale, lasting either 30 years or until foreclosure. A 'preservation entity' is a housing credit agency or approved organization. The term 'preservation entity' refers to a housing credit agency or approved organization with the capacity to acquire and preserve eligible multifamily housing property independently from the seller partnership or its affiliates. Housing credit agencies allocate preservation credits based on the State preservation credit ceiling for each calendar year. If a State has multiple housing credit agencies, they are treated as a single agency for allocation purposes. The State preservation credit ceiling is determined by the housing credit agency of each State. If a State has multiple agencies, they are considered as one entity. The ceiling includes unused credits from the previous year, $1.00 per state population, $1,000,000, returned credits, and any additional allocation from the Secretary. Unused credits are the excess from the previous year's total. The preservation credit ceiling for a calendar year is the excess of certain amounts over the allocated preservation credit dollar amount. Unallocated credit is allocated to qualified States for the next year if not used. Unused preservation credit carryover is the unused credit from the previous year. The unused preservation credit carryover of a State for any calendar year is the excess of the unused State preservation credit ceiling from the previous year over the aggregate preservation credit dollar amount allocated for the current year. The allocated amount is determined based on the population ratio of the State compared to all qualified States. The term 'housing credit agency' is defined in section 42(h)(8)(A). The housing credit agency is responsible for determining the viability of rehabilitation plans for eligible multifamily housing properties, monitoring affordability restrictions, and reporting noncompliance to the IRS. Noncompliance may result in an increased tax liability for the taxpayer. The IRS may impose an increased tax liability on taxpayers for noncompliance with affordable housing preservation credit requirements. This credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. The IRS may impose increased tax liability for noncompliance with affordable housing preservation credit requirements, part of the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. A new item is added to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 after section 45F. The amendments made by section 42A, regarding the Affordable Housing Preservation Credit, will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
