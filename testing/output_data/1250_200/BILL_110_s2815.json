The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to increase annual and aggregate loan limits for undergraduate dependent students. The maximum annual amount a student can borrow is the sum of the previous amount plus $1,000, with an aggregate limit of $29,500. The maximum annual amount of loans for undergraduate independent students is determined by adding the amount from paragraph (1) and $6,000 for students in their first 2 years of study at an eligible institution. The aggregate limit for borrowing is $29,500. The maximum annual loan amount for undergraduate students is $6,000 for programs at least one academic year long, or a prorated amount for shorter programs. Students who have completed their first and second years can receive additional funds. The maximum annual loan amount for undergraduate students who have completed their first and second years but not the remainder of the program is $7,000. If the student is in a program with less than one academic year remaining, the loan amount is prorated based on the remaining time. The maximum aggregate amount of loans for undergraduate students enrolled in specified coursework is $57,500. Interest capitalized does not exceed this limit. Amendments to the Higher Education Act include changes to loan limits for graduate students. Amendments to the Higher Education Act include changes to loan limits for graduate students, such as modifying the definition of a student to exclude independent students and inserting a definition for graduate or professional students. Amendments to the Higher Education Act include in-school deferment of PLUS loans for parents of dependent students until the student stops being enrolled at least half-time, and the creation of a secondary market of last resort. The Secretary serves as the secondary market of last resort for certain loans under the Higher Education Act, buying loans from eligible lenders at a price equal to the outstanding principal and accrued interest. The Secretary holds and services these loans in the same manner as similar loans under part D, without altering the terms of the promissory note. The Secretary can buy a representative subset of loans from eligible lenders under certain sections of the Higher Education Act, without requiring a new promissory note. The authority for this expires on July 1, 2009, but may be extended if economic circumstances warrant it for continued access to student loans. The Secretary can extend the sunset provision for uninterrupted access to student loans for up to 12 months multiple times. The effective date of this amendment is upon the enactment of the Act.
