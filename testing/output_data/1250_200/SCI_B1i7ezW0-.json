    "content": "We utilize an inversion scheme for deep neural networks to create a versatile semi-supervised learning framework for various systems and issues. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST and shows promising performance on SVHN and CIFAR10. It introduces the use of residual networks in semi-supervised tasks for the first time, demonstrating its effectiveness on one-dimensional signals. This method is simple, efficient, and does not require changes to the deep network architecture. Semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve generalization and reduce the need for large labeled datasets. In this paper, a new semi-supervised learning approach for deep neural networks is introduced. It involves equipping any DNN with an inverse for input reconstruction and incorporating unlabeled data into the learning process through a new loss function. The simplicity of this approach allows for easy derivation and computation of the inverse function, enabling the minimization of errors between input signals and estimates without additional cost or model changes. The semi-supervised learning approach for deep neural networks involves using an inverse function to reconstruct input signals, minimizing errors without extra cost or model changes. This method, which incorporates unlabeled data through a new loss function, shows promise for advancing semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, there are challenges in generalizing this approach to other network topologies like recurrent or residual networks. The lack of a clear path to generalize the approach to other network topologies, such as recurrent or residual networks, is a challenge. The per-layer \"greedy\" reconstruction loss may need precise weighting and extensive hyper-parameter cross-validation. The probabilistic formulation of deep convolutional nets supports semi-supervised learning, but requires ReLU activation functions and a deep convolutional network topology. Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning aims to constrain representations of the same input stimuli in the latent space, providing stability in the representation. Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training also offers a method for semi-supervised learning. This paper introduces a new optimization framework for semi-supervised learning, focusing on input reconstruction for DNN stability. It proposes a simple way to invert any piecewise differentiable mapping, including DNNs, without changing their structure. The method significantly improves on existing approaches through penalty terms leveraging the input reconstruction formula. The paper introduces a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning, focusing on input reconstruction for DNN stability. It leverages penalty terms to improve on existing approaches and provides a mathematical justification for interpreting DNNs as linear splines. The paper presents a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning, emphasizing input reconstruction for DNN stability. It introduces penalty terms to enhance existing methods and offers a mathematical rationale for viewing DNNs as linear splines. The study compares templates of different network topologies, highlighting the significance of an additional term for stability and linear connection between input and inner representations. It suggests that optimal DNN templates for prediction should be proportional to the input, positively for the target class and negatively for others. The optimal templates for DNN prediction are proportional to the input, positively for the target class and negatively for others. This minimizes the cross-entropy loss with softmax nonlinearity. Theoretical analysis shows that reconstruction is implied by these optimal templates, leveraging the closest input hyperplane for representation. This method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN input representation. The method utilizes a hyperplane for input representation, focusing on DNN representation rather than exact input reconstruction. Bias correction is compared to known frameworks, with insights on ReLU-based nonlinearities resembling soft-thresholding denoising. The inverse strategy is applied to arbitrary DNN tasks, supporting semi-supervised learning by adjusting the objective training function. Automatic differentiation is used for efficiency in updating parameters based on gradient changes. The efficiency of the inversion scheme lies in rewriting deep networks as linear mappings, allowing for the derivation of a network inverse. This inverse is used to define unsupervised and semi-supervised loss functions. The reconstruction error is crucial for neural networks and common frameworks, representing the reconstruction loss. Differentiable reconstruction losses can be used, with a focus on incorporating this loss for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. The reconstruction loss R is defined as mean squared error or cosine similarity. A \"specialization\" loss based on Shannon entropy complements the reconstruction loss for semi-supervised learning. The complete loss function combines cross entropy for labeled data, reconstruction loss, and entropy loss with adjustable ratios for supervised and unsupervised learning. The weighting between supervised and unsupervised losses is crucial for guiding learning towards a better optimum. Results of the approach on a semi-supervised task using the MNIST dataset are presented, achieving reasonable performances with different topologies. The dataset consists of 70000 grayscale images split into a training set of 60000 images and a test set of 10000 images. A search is performed over different parameters and topologies, including the use of inhibitor DNN (IDNN) to stabilize training and remove biases units. The proposed approach aims to stabilize training and remove biases units by introducing winner-share-all connections. Resnet topologies, especially wide Resnet, achieve the best performance, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.
