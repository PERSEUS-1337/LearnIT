    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the need to produce 11,900,000 degrees and credentials by 2025, with a projected gap of 2,400,000. California's community colleges are vital in addressing this gap, as only 32 percent of students complete credentials on time. Financial aid programs like the Cal Grant and BOG Fee Waiver are crucial for low-income students' college enrollment and success. The Cal Grant Program awards over $2 billion annually, making it the largest state grant program in the nation. The BOG Fee Waiver Program provides free tuition to almost half of all California Community College students. However, access grants do not cover all college costs, leaving many low-income students without support. Needy students at California's community colleges face higher costs compared to attending UC or CSU after accounting for all financial aid available. The California Master Plan for Higher Education guarantees affordable education for all Californians. The Legislature aims to increase grant aid to cover nontuition costs for community college students, especially those in career technical education programs. California community colleges are encouraged to educate students about financial aid options and urge them to apply by the deadline. Starting from the 2001-02 academic year, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program was established for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award. The program is not an entitlement, and awards are granted on a competitive basis. Up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually starting from the 2016-17 academic year. Students must meet general eligibility criteria and priorities set by the commission to qualify for the awards. Starting from the 2001-02 academic year, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program was established for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award. Up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually starting from the 2016-17 academic year. Students must meet general eligibility criteria and priorities set by the commission to qualify for the awards. Fifteen thousand awards are available to all students meeting financial and academic requirements, with a March 2 deadline for baccalaureate degree institutions and a choice of March 2 or September 2 deadline for California community college students. Nineteen thousand awards are reserved for California community college students, with a September 2 deadline for application. Starting from the fall term of the 2017\u201318 academic year, students in occupational or technical training courses at a California community college are eligible for Cal Grant B awards. The commission will distribute any remaining awards to eligible students based on financial need and academic merit, with special consideration for disadvantaged students. Selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards under the competitive program will be established by February 1, 2001, taking into account various factors hindering students' access to postsecondary education. Additional consideration will be given to specific criteria outlined by the commission. Additional consideration will be given to students pursuing Cal Grant B awards who reestablish their grade point averages and those who did not receive awards in previous articles. All other eligible students can compete for an award. Terms like \"career pathway,\" \"economic security,\" \"industry cluster,\" and \"long-term unemployed\" are defined in this section. A Cal Grant C award is for long-term unemployed individuals seeking occupational or technical training. The training must be at least four months long, with the number of awards determined annually. The commission selects students for grants for occupational or technical training based on various criteria, giving special consideration to disadvantaged applicants facing economic hardship or barriers to employment. Criteria include family income, household status, employment status, and whether the applicant is long-term unemployed. Cal Grant C award recipients can renew their grants until they finish their training. The grants cover tuition, fees, training-related costs, and living expenses. The commission considers the applicant's financial situation and available state and federal programs when determining award amounts. The commission, in consultation with state and federal agencies, identifies areas of occupational training for Cal Grant C awards. They consult with industry clusters, workforce professionals, and educators to prioritize programs. The training areas are reviewed every five years, with an update required by January 1, 2016. The commission updates priority areas for occupational and technical training by January 1, 2016. Priority for Cal Grant C awards is given to students in training programs meeting specific job quality criteria. These criteria include high employer demand, employment growth, salary projections, and career pathway articulation. At least one of the criteria related to salary projections or career pathways must be met for priority consideration. The commission determines areas of occupational or technical training in consultation with relevant departments and agencies using labor market projections. They publish and update a list of these areas on their website. The commission prioritizes Cal Grant C award applicants for programs with high graduation rates and job placement data. They collaborate with various agencies to publicize the grant program to long-term unemployed individuals. The commission collaborates with agencies to promote the Cal Grant C program to long-term unemployed individuals. They consult with various workforce agencies to develop a plan for informing students about job search services. The Legislative Analyst's Office is required to submit reports on the program's outcomes biennially. The Legislative Analyst's Office is required to submit reports biennially on the Cal Grant C program outcomes, including data on recipients' demographics, training program categories, selection priority, job placements, and comparison of programs before and after program implementation.
