The Act, titled the \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act,\" requires states receiving funds to develop a longitudinal data system for public charter schools within 4 years. States must also form an advisory committee within 6 months to advise on the system's development and implementation, with members having experience in data systems. The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" mandates states to establish a longitudinal data system for public charter schools. States must create an advisory committee with members experienced in data systems, including those with backgrounds in operating unions, teaching, program administration, business, civil rights, and academic research. The data system must include a unique statewide student identifier, student-level enrollment and demographic information, the ability to track academic assessment scores over time, and other relevant student data. The Act requires states to establish a longitudinal data system for public charter schools, including student-level data on academic assessments, reasons for non-participation, education system entrance and exit details, a statewide audit system for data quality, a unique teacher identifier, student transcript information, and the ability to link information from preschool to grade 12. The data system required by the Act must link information from preschool through grade 12, including data on students with disabilities, to higher education and workforce development systems. It should also ensure student privacy, effective data architecture, and the ability to produce standardized reports. The data system required by the Act must link student records over time and across databases, produce standardized or customized reports for educators and policymakers, ensure interoperability among software interfaces, support longitudinal analysis of student achievement growth, and allow for electronic portability of data and records. The Act requires interoperability with migratory student records, electronic portability of data, professional development for system users, researcher access to data, and protection of employee rights. States with preexisting data systems must meet Act requirements. States must certify system implementation with an independent audit. Prior to implementing the data system required by the Act, a State must submit an independently conducted audit certifying that the system meets the Act's requirements. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008 and the following 3 years. Funds will be allocated to each State based on enrollment of students in kindergarten through grade 12. The Secretary will allot funds after States submit an application. After a State submits an application for funds, the Secretary may withhold up to 25% of the State's funds if substantial progress is not made towards implementing the data system. Once the State's data system is certified, funds can be used for maintaining, operating, and upgrading data systems, providing data integrity training, and offering professional development to teachers and administrators. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of providing professional development to educators on data collection and analysis, aligning data systems with local student information systems, and conducting data analyses to improve policy and instructional practices. Additionally, it mentions reserving funds for a State Education Data Center grant. The Secretary will reserve 1 percent, up to $2,000,000, for a grant to nonprofit entities supporting State education data centers. Nonprofit entities must apply for the grant, commit to seeking additional private funds, provide a plan for financial support, and demonstrate expertise in education data system development. The entity receiving grant funds must provide technical assistance to states for developing education data systems, disseminate best practices, and serve as a central repository for education and school safety data. The entity must also make the data publicly available in accordance with privacy laws."
