    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more unsupervised time alone, and are at higher risk of violence during after school hours. The Act sets goals to address these challenges. The Act aims to increase academic success, improve skills, promote safe environments, prepare for workforce, and provide alternatives to risky behaviors. It defines terms like \"school\" and \"Secretary\" and authorizes a program for grants to schools for specific activities. The Act requires schools receiving grants to carry out specific activities such as mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Schools may also choose to implement drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. These activities must be provided after regular school hours and tailored to the needs of the population, students, and community. Activities should take place in a school building or designated public facility. The Act encourages schools to involve volunteers from the business and academic communities, request donations of computer equipment, and collaborate with state and local park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. Each school seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how they will meet the goals of the Act, show collaborative efforts, describe activity administration, avoid duplication with other programs, outline funding sources, and plan for non-Federal funding. Authorization of appropriations is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002 to carry out the Act."
