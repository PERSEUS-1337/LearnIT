    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with African-Americans being overrepresented in executions and on death row. The death penalty system in the United States shows racial disparities in capital prosecution, with a high percentage of African-American and Hispanic defendants selected for capital punishment. Additionally, prisoner appeals have been limited by the Supreme Court since 1976, increasing the risk of wrongful imprisonment and execution. In 1996, new legislation limited Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners, making it difficult for them to appeal their convictions and death sentences. Federal and State death penalty executions are halted until Congress reviews the final recommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty. The Commission's guidelines and procedures must be either implemented or rejected through legislation repealing this section. The National Commission on the Death Penalty is established with 15 members appointed by the President. The Commission includes prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, law enforcement officials, and individuals with expertise in relevant matters.
