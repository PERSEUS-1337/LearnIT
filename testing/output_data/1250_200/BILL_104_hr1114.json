The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to allow 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards. The amendment allows 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards, including an on-off switch with key-lock control, maintained in the custody of employees 18 years or older, and with a notice posted stating the restrictions for employees under 18. The Secretary will publish safety standards for scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, certified to protect minors. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving these machines. The reports required by the Secretary for incidents involving injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 using scrap paper balers or paper box compactors must include details such as employer and employee information, incident date, injury description, and equipment details. Reports must be submitted promptly within 10 days of the incident. The Secretary must conduct an investigation before determining if employers have violated child labor laws based on incident reports. Reporting requirements expire 2 years after enactment. SEC. 2 amends Section 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include section 13(c)(5) and clarifies the penalties. SEC. 3 states that Section 1 does not affect the exemption for apprentices and student learners in the Code of Federal Regulations."
