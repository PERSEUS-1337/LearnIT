    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Research shows that investing in physical activity can reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives can encourage more Americans to be active. The United States lags in preventing obesity-related deaths, highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity from a young age. The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly related to being overweight and obese, by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increasing participation in physical fitness activities. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified sports and fitness expenses as amounts paid for medical care. This includes membership at a fitness facility, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for physical activity. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for qualified sports and fitness expenses, including membership at a fitness facility and participation in physical exercise programs. The overall dollar limitation for these expenses is $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers or heads of household. A fitness facility is defined as a facility providing instruction in physical exercise, promoting physical fitness, and not being a private club. The text chunk discusses the criteria for a facility to be considered a qualified sports and fitness expense, excluding private clubs and facilities offering specific activities like golf or hunting. It also mentions that exercise videos and books can be considered qualified expenses if they provide instruction in physical exercise. Amounts paid for equipment for fitness, exercise, sports, or physical activity programs must meet specific criteria to be considered a qualified sports and fitness expense. This includes exclusivity of use, non-apparel or footwear items, and a limit of $250 for sports equipment. Rules similar to section 213(d)(6) apply to programs with components beyond physical exercise. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act."
