    "content": "Political instability in Georgia escalated in November 2007 as opposition parties formed a \"National Council\" and demanded early legislative elections. Former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili accused President Mikheil Saakashvili of ordering murder, leading to calls for Saakashvili's resignation. Demonstrations were forcibly dispersed by police, resulting in injuries, and the independent Imedi television station was shut down. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency, claiming the events were a Russian-backed coup attempt. International criticism followed the crackdown. The demonstrations in Georgia were part of a coup attempt orchestrated by Russia, leading to the expulsion of three Russian diplomats. Saakashvili stepped down as president to hold early elections for a clear mandate to deal with foreign threats. Legislative Speaker Nino Burjanadze became acting president and called for a plebiscite on election timing and NATO membership. Imedi TV resumed broadcasts and became a platform for opposition candidates. Electoral code amendments were made to enhance democracy, but last-minute changes caused implementation issues. The adoption of new rules shortly before the election led to haphazard implementation, according to the OSCE. The nomination process for presidential candidates was considered inclusive and transparent. Saakashvili and six other candidates were successfully registered. Campaign pledges included reducing corruption, improving living conditions, and restoring territorial integrity. Other candidates pledged to create a parliamentary system, bolster freedom of speech, and boost social services. Several presidential candidates in Georgia pledged to improve living conditions, reduce corruption, and restore territorial integrity. Most candidates called for a parliamentary system and membership in NATO, except for Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia and Badri Patarkatsishvili. Patarkatsishvili proposed abolishing the presidency, creating a confederation with Russia, and providing benefits to the poor. Campaigning included mass rallies and accusations, with Patarkatsishvili facing charges of involvement in a coup attempt. During the Georgian presidential campaign, accusations overshadowed issues. The government released recordings accusing Patarkatsishvili of planning a coup, which he denied. Despite initially stepping down as a candidate, he later reversed his decision. Saakashvili won with over 50% of the vote, avoiding a second round. Voters supported Georgia joining NATO and holding legislative elections in spring 2008. Efforts to conduct balloting in South Ossetia were denounced by officials there. The government's attempt to conduct balloting in South Ossetia was criticized by officials in the breakaway region, claiming most residents are Russian citizens. Saakashvili's election victory was attributed to a growing economy, improved social services, and promises to alleviate poverty. Opposition disunity and election observer reports highlighted both positive aspects like competitive candidate choices and negative aspects such as pervasive violations. The election campaign for Saakashvili was marred by violations including harassment of opposition campaigners, coercion of state employees to vote for him, and biased handling of complaints by the CEC. The vote count was viewed negatively by monitors, with many assessing it as bad. Electoral abuses varied by region and were often due to incompetence or local fraud. The CEC and courts invalidated or corrected results in 18 precincts. Fair Elections reported that Saakashvili may have won enough votes to avoid a runoff. Saakashvili's victory in the election may have been inflated, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results. Russian observers criticized the election for lack of fairness, citing administrative resources and pressure on opposition candidates. Despite concerns, the relatively peaceful campaign was seen as a positive sign for democratization in Georgia. Saakashvili promised greater opposition participation in decision-making, indicating progress towards stability and democratization. Opposition parties and politicians may benefit from the campaign, gaining votes in upcoming legislative elections and enhancing political pluralism. Saakashvili's re-election reassured international investors of Georgia's stable investment climate, but increased social spending could lead to short-term inflation. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe urged opposition politicians to address electoral irregularities through constitutional procedures. Thousands protested against the alleged fraudulent election results. Many protesters gathered on January 13 and 20 to peacefully protest against the alleged fraudulent election results. Saakashvili's victory with 53% of the vote raised concerns about declining public trust in his governance. Observers noted that his win dealt a blow to Russia's influence in Georgia and could lead to further tensions. Saakashvili's re-election raised concerns about tensions with Russia, but he reassured them in his inaugural address. The U.S. State Department welcomed his call for early elections and urged him to restore media broadcasts for a fair election. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza visited Tbilisi with proposals to support democratic reform in Georgia. Condoleezza Rice proposed measures to boost democratic reform in Georgia, emphasizing U.S. support for democracy over energy interests. He urged Georgian politicians to ease tensions and make compromises for progress. The U.S. reaffirmed support for Georgia's NATO aspirations, with NATO possibly delaying a Membership Action Plan decision until after the May 2008 legislative election. Georgia's performance in the May 2008 legislative election was praised by the State Department, but concerns were raised about electoral violations. President Bush congratulated Saakashvili after the final election results were announced, leading to some opposition criticism. The U.S. has long supported democratization in Georgia. The U.S. has long supported democratization in Georgia, with Congress urging NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan for Georgia. Senator Richard Lugar introduced a resolution supporting free and fair elections in Georgia, emphasizing the importance of international election monitors. Representative Alcee Hastings was appointed as Special Coordinator by the OSCE Chairman-in-Office to lead a mission of short-term observers. Representative Alcee Hastings led a mission of 500 short-term observers from the OSCE to monitor the January 5 election in Georgia. He viewed the election as a \"viable expression of free choice\" but warned of challenges due to mistrust and polarization. Former Representative Jim Kolbe, from the International Republican Institute, found the election to be broadly free and fair but called for further reforms."
