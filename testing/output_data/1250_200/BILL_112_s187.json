The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates that a specific percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light duty trucks must be manufactured. Model years 2014 and 2015 require 50 percent, while model year 2016 and onwards need 90 percent. There is an exception for vehicles operating solely on electricity. Additionally, regulations must be established within a year of the Act's enactment, and a new section 32902A is added to the code. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines terms like blender pump, E-85 fuel, ethanol fuel blend, and major fuel distributor. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines a distributor as a person who owns a refinery or markets its output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary of Energy will make grants to eligible facilities for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and providing subgrants to retailers for ethanol fuel blends. The Blender Pump Grant Program offers grants for installing ethanol fuel infrastructure, including blender pumps and storage tanks. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for these grants. The Federal government covers up to 50% of the project costs. Facilities or retailers must offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years within a 4-year period or repay the grant amount. The Secretary authorizes appropriations for the Blender Pump Grant Program, with varying amounts allocated for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Major fuel distributors can install blender pumps at owned and branded stations, with E-85 fuel being a key component. In this paragraph, E-85 fuel is defined as a blend of gasoline with approximately 85% ethanol content, while an ethanol fuel blend is a mix of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% ethanol content. A major fuel distributor is defined as a person owning or directly marketing refinery output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a certain percentage of their stations for at least 5 years. The Secretary of Energy will mandate major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a specified percentage of their stations for a minimum of 5 years, based on the applicable percentage determined for majority-owned and branded stations. The Secretary of Energy will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a specified percentage of their stations for a minimum of 5 years, based on the applicable percentage determined for majority-owned and branded stations. The percentages are set to increase over the years, starting at 10% in 2014 and reaching 50% in 2020 and beyond. The Secretary of Energy will require major fuel distributors to ensure the installation of blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a specified percentage of their stations. The distributors must assume full financial responsibility for the costs of installing the blender pumps and any necessary equipment. Major fuel distributors must cover the costs of installing blender pumps and equipment for E-85 fuel. If they exceed installation requirements, they earn credits applicable for three consecutive years. Major fuel distributors can earn credits for exceeding installation requirements for E-85 fuel, which can be sold to other distributors. However, these credits cannot be used to fulfill geographic distribution requirements. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines, with the definition of renewable fuel and renewable fuel pipelines clarified and the guarantee amount set at 80 percent of the project cost. Loan guarantees are available for the rapid deployment of renewable fuel pipelines, with the guarantee amount set at 80 percent of the project cost. The Secretary of Energy will promulgate regulations within 90 days of the enactment of the Act to implement the amendments related to renewable fuel pipelines."
