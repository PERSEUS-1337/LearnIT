    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Workers must pay $132.50 for the TWIC, which is valid for five years and requires renewal with an additional fee and trips to an enrollment center. The TWIC enrollment process requires workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center and pay $132.50 for a new card. This process is not mandated by statute or regulation but is driven by a DHS policy decision to align with standards for Personal Identity Verification. The Department may deviate from the standard for the TWIC program if deemed necessary. Possession of a TWIC does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the flexibility to develop an alternative enrollment process for TWIC. Other secure identity documents can be mailed to applicants. Congress mandated requirements for TWIC biometric readers. Congress mandated the issuance of a final rule for TWIC biometric readers within two years of the pilot program, but as of now, no such rule has been issued. Congress mandated the issuance of a final rule for TWIC biometric readers within two years of the pilot program, but as of now, no such rule has been issued. It is urgent that the TWIC application process be reformed by the end of 2012 to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should deploy TWIC readers promptly to enhance security, and funds awarded for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. The Secretary of Homeland Security must reform the TWIC application process within 90 days to streamline enrollment and renewal, requiring only one in-person visit in most cases. This reform was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
