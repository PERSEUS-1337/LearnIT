Violating this rule can lead to revocation of their status or taxation on political expenditures. Only two churches have lost their 501(c)(3) status for campaign intervention, including the Church at Pierce Creek in New York. The Johnson Amendment, named after Senator Lyndon Johnson, prohibits campaign intervention by 501(c)(3) organizations. Some religious organizations, like Christian Echoes National Ministry, have had their tax-exempt status revoked for violating this rule. The provision was introduced in 1954 and is often compared to lobbying limitations. The Johnson Amendment prohibits campaign intervention by 501(c)(3) organizations. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates, but they can engage in issue advocacy, lobbying, and certain election-related activities that do not show a preference for any candidate. The line between prohibited and permitted political activities can be subtle and depends on the specific circumstances of each case. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in voter education activities but must avoid bias towards any candidate. Factors that could indicate bias include not including all candidates equally, supporting a slate of candidates, comparing the church's position on issues with candidates, or covering only issues important to the church. Churches can invite candidates to events as long as no bias is shown, and if an individual appears as a candidate, other candidates must be given equal opportunity to speak, fundraising cannot occur, and the entity must make clear it is not supporting or opposing any candidate. The tax laws do not prohibit religious leaders from participating in campaign activity as individuals. They may endorse or oppose candidates in their private capacity, but should not represent their house of worship. Leaders cannot make campaign-related statements in the entity's publications, events, or using its assets, even if identified with the house of worship. IRS has special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and other houses of worship to ensure compliance with campaign activity restrictions. An inquiry can only begin if a high-level Treasury official believes, based on written facts, that the entity may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status. The IRS must then provide written notice to the house of worship outlining the inquiry's subject matter and concerns. If the entity's response does not address the IRS's concerns adequately, further action may be taken. The IRS has special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and houses of worship to ensure compliance with campaign activity restrictions. If the entity's response to the IRS's concerns is inadequate, a second written notice is provided for an examination of records and activities. The inquiry and examination must be completed within two years, and any revocation of 501(c)(3) status requires approval from IRS counsel. Further inquiries and examinations are limited within a five-year period. Before an inquiry can begin, a high-level Treasury official must reasonably believe the house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status. Before the IRS can start an inquiry, an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must reasonably believe that a house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status. The determination was previously made by the Director of Exempt Organizations, Examinations, but changes were made after a federal district court ruling in 2009. The IRS then proposed regulations for the Director, Exempt Organizations to make the determination, who is a senior executive responsible for nationwide activities for Exempt Organizations. Some argue that this position may not meet the necessary requirements. Some argue that the Director, Exempt Organizations may not meet the criteria to be considered an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" responsible for nationwide activities. Finalization of regulations regarding political campaign prohibition has been delayed, raising concerns about IRS enforcement and potential violations of First Amendment rights by churches. The issue has been addressed by two U.S. Courts of Appeals, with differing outcomes. The Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that lobbying and campaign activity restrictions on a religious organization violated the First Amendment. The court held that these limitations did not infringe on the Free Exercise Clause, only denying tax-exempt status. The court upheld restrictions on lobbying and campaign activities for a religious organization, stating that denying tax-exempt status did not violate the First Amendment. The court emphasized the importance of maintaining separation between church and state, and justified the limitations as necessary to prevent government subsidizing organizations with political goals. In Branch Ministries v. Rossotti, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate the church's free exercise and free speech rights. The court found that the revocation did not substantially burden the church's right to freely exercise its religion, as it only resulted in less money for its religious activities, which was deemed not constitutionally significant. The court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate the church's free exercise and free speech rights. The church could set up a related 501(c)(4) organization to establish a political action committee (PAC) for its opinions about candidates. The court rejected claims of viewpoint discrimination and explained that the campaign prohibition applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations. The IRS developed the political activity compliance initiative in 2004 to address concerns of 501(c)(3) organizations violating campaign prohibition. It includes public outreach and a fast-track review process. Results from the 2004 and 2006 cycles showed 132 cases reviewed, with 22 cases not warranting examination. The initiative has not been updated or publicly discussed since 2008, possibly due to the Living Word Christian Center decision impacting IRS procedures. In a review of cases involving houses of worship, 110 cases were examined by the IRS. Of these, 47 cases involved houses of worship, with 46 of them being closed by 2007. The IRS issued advisories in 42 cases where churches engaged in campaign activity, citing mitigating factors such as one-time nature or good faith reliance on counsel. Impermissible activities included distributing biased voter guides and allowing candidates to use church facilities. The IRS examined 100 cases in 2006, with 44 involving houses of worship. By 2007, 14 cases were closed, with no substantiated campaign activity found in 10 cases. The IRS found 269 apparent instances of campaign contributions from 501(c)(3) organizations, including $45,151 from churches. FECA prohibits corporations, including religious entities, from using general treasury funds for federal election contributions. The IRS found instances of campaign contributions from 501(c)(3) organizations, including churches. FECA prohibits corporations, including religious entities, from using general treasury funds for federal election contributions. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC invalidated prohibitions on corporations and labor unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures, citing a violation of the First Amendment. Due to tax code prohibitions, houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status are generally not allowed to engage in regulated activities under FECA. In the 112th Congress, legislation H.R. 3600 has been introduced to repeal the IRC provision prohibiting 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from engaging in campaign activity without risking their tax-exempt status. If enacted, this would allow them to participate in campaign activities while still meeting other criteria for tax-exempt status. The bill introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 3600, aims to repeal the IRC provision that prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from engaging in campaign activity without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. If enacted, this would allow them to participate in campaign activities while still meeting other criteria for tax-exempt status. The bill does not change the current IRC reporting requirements for houses of worship, and it expressly states that it does not invalidate or limit any provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The bill introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 3600, aims to repeal the IRC provision that prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from engaging in campaign activity without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This legislation follows previous bills that addressed allowing houses of worship to participate in campaign activities."
