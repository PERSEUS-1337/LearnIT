    "content": "The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit by eliminating the existing credit and inserting a new section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" introduces a new Child Tax Credit, allowing a credit for qualifying children based on their age and the taxpayer's income. The credit is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" introduces a new Child Tax Credit based on modified adjusted gross income. The threshold amount varies based on marital status, with a joint return at $110,000, an individual at $75,000, and a married individual filing separately at $55,000. The applicable amount is determined by the credit allowable under subsection (a). The Child Tax Credit is calculated by dividing the credit amount by $20 multiplied by the total number of qualifying children. A qualifying child is defined as one under 19 years old, with exceptions for non-citizens. The $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) will be adjusted for inflation after 2017. The $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) will be increased annually based on the cost of living adjustment. If the increase is not a multiple of $50, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Taxpayers must include the name and taxpayer identification number of qualifying children on their tax return to claim the credit. Taxpayer identification number must be issued before the due date for filing the return to claim the credit. No credit allowed if the number was issued after the due date. Credit not allowable for taxable year less than 12 months, except in case of taxpayer's death. No credit for fraudulent claims within disallowance period of 10 taxable years. Taxpayers who make improper claims for credit under this section will be denied for subsequent years unless they provide necessary information to prove eligibility.
