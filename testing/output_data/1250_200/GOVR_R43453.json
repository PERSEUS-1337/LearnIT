    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualifying for the highest amount. Other technologies receive a reduced credit. Construction start dates determine eligibility for the credit. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for wind facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2020. The credit amount decreases for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC is set to phase out once electricity market prices exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for the first four years of the credit. Unused credits could be carried forward. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was previously limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for the first four years of the credit, but this limitation was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) or an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits. There are also production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific placed-in-service requirements. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for coal has no placed-in-service limitation after December 31, 2015. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. Refined coal has a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton, with a 2018 credit of $7.307 per ton after inflation adjustment. Refined coal facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The PTC, first enacted in 1992, has been extended 11 times since 1999. Initially available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC was set to expire on June 30, 1999, but has been extended multiple times. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with various amendments and additions to qualifying technologies. The PTC was initially set to expire on June 30, 1999, but has been extended through legislation such as the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act, and the Working Families Tax Relief Act. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 introduced new qualifying resources and modified the PTC, including a five-year PTC period for certain resources and a reduced credit amount for others. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 introduced a Production Tax Credit (PTC) for refined coal at $4.375 per ton, extended the PTC for various facilities through 2007, added hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources, and extended the credit period to 10 years for most facilities. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 further extended the PTC through 2008 for qualifying facilities excluding solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2008 for various facilities, excluding solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 further extended the PTC for wind and refined coal through 2009, and for other resources through 2010. New qualifying resources were added, including marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. A credit for steel industry fuel was introduced, set at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided additional support. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2013 for wind and other renewable energy technologies under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Act also introduced the Section 1603 grant program for PTC-eligible taxpayers. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Section 1603 grant program through 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the PTC for wind through 2013 and changed the credit expiration date. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and other renewable energy technologies was extended through various acts, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities. The PTC for wind was further extended through 2019 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Nonwind technologies and Indian coal PTCs were retroactively extended for 2017 but will not be available after 2017 without further legislative action. Estimated revenue losses for PTCs between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for $24.0 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for $24.0 billion. Other PTCs include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower, totaling $1.7 billion. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal amount to $0.1 billion each. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, mostly for renewable electricity production. In 2013, taxpayers claimed PTCs of $2.8 billion, with some carrying forward unused credits. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected renewable energy tax credit claims, with fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants were claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible, but the costs are not directly comparable as grants were one-time payments. The economic downturn impacted tax credit carry forwards, with PTC amounts doubling between 2008 and 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a permanent PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. Recent extensions of the PTC reflect a belief that tax incentives contribute to the development of renewable energy infrastructure. Research suggests that the PTC has driven investment and growth in the wind industry. Further extension of the PTC may lead to more investment and growth, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are seen as windfall benefits for taxpayers. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has led to increased use of renewable electricity resources, but its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Research shows that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. Recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar have contributed to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by the presence of externalities, such as pollution, which create market failures. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are not the most efficient way to address market inefficiencies in the energy sector. These subsidies reduce the average cost of energy, leading to increased consumption and offsetting emissions reductions. They also do not provide equal incentives for all emissions reduction alternatives and can favor more costly reductions. Additionally, tax subsidies reduce tax revenues, impacting economic efficiency. A more direct and economically efficient approach would be a direct tax on pollution. A more efficient approach to addressing pollution in the energy sector is through a direct tax on emissions, like a carbon tax. This would generate revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the best way to support renewable energy as they often benefit outside investors more than the sector itself. Incentives that reward production over investment may lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. Tax incentives are not the most effective way to support renewable energy. Incentives that reward production over investment can result in more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension. Congress may choose to extend the PTC for wind projects separately from other technologies. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable energy may be extended for nonwind technologies, potentially retroactively for 2018. Different expiration dates exist for wind and other technologies, with options to remove the phaseout for wind or apply it to all PTC-eligible technologies. A proposed PTC phaseout in 2014 aimed to reduce the PTC value to 1.5 cents per kWh for all eligible properties within a 10-year window. Facilities receiving a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014 saw the value decrease to 1.5 cents per kWh in 2015. Chairman Camp proposed full repeal after 2024, raising $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and adding solar facilities as qualifying property. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC. The investment tax credit (ITC) for renewable energy would be made permanent under President Obama's proposal. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed making the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for renewable energy permanent, costing $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
