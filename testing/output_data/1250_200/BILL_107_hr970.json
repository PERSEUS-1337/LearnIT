Subparts and sections are redesignated accordingly. \"SEC. 4121. COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\" The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to States for implementing prevention programs meeting high scientific standards. States must submit a plan detailing the grant selection process, funding only well-defined prevention programs, disseminating research-based materials, and providing technical assistance to local agencies. The State educational agency must evaluate, select, develop, and implement prevention programs, evaluate their implementation, ensure local programs meet requirements, supplement other funds, and meet additional criteria as required by the Secretary. SEC. 4122 outlines the reservations and allocations of funds for the implementation of prevention programs.

Priority is given to agencies with demonstrated need, grants must support startup costs for prevention plans, and awards should be distributed equitably across different regions and school types.
