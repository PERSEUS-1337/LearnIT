    "title": "AB 1303",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California states that within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose new conditions for building permits beyond those already approved. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits local agencies from imposing new conditions for building permits after final map approval for a residential subdivision, unless necessary for health and safety reasons, compliance with state or federal law, or zoning ordinance enforcement. This also applies to newly incorporated cities or city and counties. When incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map, conditions imposed by the city refer to what the county could have imposed without incorporation. For extended subdivision maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. Cities, counties, or city and counties can still levy fees or conditions related to building permits. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code extends the expiration date of certain tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps approved within specific counties by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps in specific counties if found consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The extension can be denied if not meeting the requirements. Upon an application to extend an approved tentative map, the map is automatically extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If the advisory agency denies the extension, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, conditions for applying this section include: household income below 80% of statewide income, unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than statewide rate, and poverty rate at least 4% higher than statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects is provided in addition to any existing extensions. Legislative approvals for projects included in extended maps will be extended by 24 months. Section 65961 conditions for building permits are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. SEC. 3. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services. SEC. 4. This act is urgent for preserving public peace, health, or safety by allowing cities and counties to extend expiring development applications due to economic conditions."
