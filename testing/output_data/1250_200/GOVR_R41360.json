    "content": "The debate over U.S. foreign assistance funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad has been a controversial issue. Members of Congress have discussed whether countries or organizations receiving U.S. funds engage in abortion-related activities and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. This debate has been ongoing since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, with legislation introduced to prohibit abortion in the United States. Legislation has been introduced to prohibit abortion in the United States, with congressional opponents seeking to ban the use of federal funds for abortions. The debate over federal funding of abortion shifted to include U.S. foreign assistance after the Roe decision, leading to restrictions on abortion and family planning in foreign aid. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they do not perform or promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued over the years. The Mexico City policy, which restricts U.S. funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad, has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations. Congressional debates continue on prohibitions and restrictions related to abortion and family planning in foreign assistance. Federal funding for these activities remains controversial, with some seeking to make the policy permanent law. This report examines legislative and executive branch policies on U.S. funding of abortion and voluntary family planning. This report discusses legislative and executive branch policies that restrict U.S. funding of abortion and voluntary family planning activities abroad. The policies are included in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations, affecting different types of foreign assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law, authorizing various types of foreign assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) authorizes different types of foreign assistance, including development, military, and security assistance. Congress has amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985. Authorization bills have often stalled due to debates on controversial issues or foreign policy disputes. In the absence of regular reauthorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations measures that influence how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed, often including family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) has been amended by Congress since 1961, with various restrictions and requirements related to U.S. foreign aid, including family planning and abortion-related provisions. These amendments are complex and may be added to other legislation for emphasis or to cover additional categories of aid. Some restrictions stand alone, while others clarify existing ones. The Leahy and Livingston amendments are examples of provisions that define terms and clarify prohibitions. This section lists legislative restrictions on abortion funding and requirements for family planning programs abroad in chronological order. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes provisions prohibiting the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. This restriction has been in place since 1978 and is reiterated in annual foreign operations appropriations. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes provisions prohibiting the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Peace Corps funding has a long-standing restriction on using funds for abortions, but medical evacuation costs for volunteers seeking abortions are covered. The Peace Corps covers the cost of medical evacuation for volunteers seeking abortions to locations where it is legally permissible. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities. This amendment has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations acts, with the most recent FY2018 Act reiterating the restriction. Additionally, in 1985, Congress enacted a provision specifying that U.S. funding for family planning projects must offer a range of family planning methods and services. The amendment introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini in 1985 requires that U.S. funding for family planning projects must offer a broad range of family planning methods and services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The funds under part I of the FAA may be used for any country or organization unless the President certifies a violation of the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized under part I of the FAA. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits the use of funds for certain purposes. The FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations Act includes the Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, which prohibits funds from being used for organizations or programs supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This provision, included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985, was adopted due to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act also includes a provision requiring any determination regarding this issue to be made within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to concerns about its program in China violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to family planning and women's health. Currently, the Trump Administration has determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. Congress has also enacted restrictions in response to these concerns. In response to concerns about UNFPA's program in China, Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires funds not used for UNFPA to be transferred to Global Health Programs for family planning and health activities, prohibits UNFPA from using funds for a program in China, and mandates that U.S. contributions be kept separate. Additionally, UNFPA cannot use U.S. funding for abortions, and the Secretary of State must report on fund withholding. In response to concerns about UNFPA's program in China, Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding. The Secretary must report on funds budgeted for a country program in China, with deductions if funds are allocated. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination based on religious beliefs for family planning grants. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination based on religious beliefs for family planning grants, ensuring that organizations supporting natural family planning methods are not excluded from funding. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for abortions as a method of family planning. The Leahy provision addresses concerns about violating the Helms amendment by allowing information and counseling on all pregnancy options without promoting or coercing abortions. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations since FY2018. In October 1998, the Tiahrt amendment was enacted as part of the FY1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, requiring voluntary family planning projects supported by the US to meet specific requirements, including no quotas or incentives for family planning acceptors. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits payment of incentives for family planning acceptors or program personnel to meet numerical targets. It also ensures that individuals have the right to refuse family planning services without losing access to benefits or healthcare. Additionally, the project must provide comprehensive information on the health benefits and risks of chosen methods and only provide experimental contraceptives in scientific studies with informed consent. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits incentives for meeting sterilization quotas and requires reporting of violations. It was introduced to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations in Peru. USAID issued guidance on implementing the Tiahrt requirements for family planning projects in April 1999. The Tiahrt amendment, aimed at preventing U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations, has been implemented through guidance issued by USAID. Violations have been reported in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines, with an audit in 2007 finding no further violations. The amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to family planning assistance. Additionally, executive branch policies such as the Mexico City policy and USAID Policy Determination 3 address abortion and voluntary family planning. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), restricts U.S. family planning aid to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. It has been implemented and reversed by the executive branch, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The policy was first issued by President Reagan in 1984 at the International Conference on Population in Mexico City, marking a shift in U.S. population policy. Under the Mexico City policy, U.S. funds cannot be used for abortions or involuntary sterilizations, but foreign NGOs can use their own funds for abortion-related activities. The policy was first issued by President Reagan in 1984 and has been reinstated and expanded by subsequent presidents. President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy in 2001, including exceptions for certain cases. President Obama revoked the policy in 2009, citing concerns about its impact on family planning programs. President Trump reinstated and expanded the policy in 2017 to include global health assistance. In 2017, President Trump expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, directing the Secretary of State to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The policy, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" applies to about $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and multilateral entities. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy excludes certain entities from receiving global health assistance and includes exemptions for specific cases like rape and incest. A review in May 2018 acknowledged challenges in implementing the policy, with some recipients refusing to agree to its terms. The report highlighted the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy faced challenges in implementation, with some recipients refusing to agree to its terms. The report emphasized the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent and outlined a review of implementation by December 15, 2018. Additionally, Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) was issued by USAID in September 1982 to ensure that voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government protect the needs and rights of individuals. USAID assistance for voluntary sterilization services requires voluntary informed consent and prohibits incentive payments to acceptors. Access to other family planning methods should be readily available. Payment guidelines for acceptors, providers, and referral agents must be reasonable based on social and economic circumstances. Payment guidelines for voluntary sterilization services must be reasonable and country-specific, with acceptors receiving compensation for extra expenses, service providers receiving per-case payment, and referral agents receiving payment for informing or referring clients. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance funded by USAID, covering U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments."
