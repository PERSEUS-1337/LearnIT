    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" outlines definitions, coordination, assessment, acquisition, and reporting related to unmanned maritime systems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It includes funding provisions and defines key terms like \"Administration\" and \"Administrator.\" The curr_chunk discusses activities between the Administration and external entities, data specifications, test or training ranges for unmanned maritime systems, and the definition of unmanned maritime systems. The curr_chunk defines unmanned maritime systems as remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including undersea and surface vehicles. It also includes aerial vehicles used for maritime issues. The Administrator directs coordination for research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This includes utilizing the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board as a coordinating mechanism. The Administrator coordinates unmanned maritime systems within NOAA using the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB). Representation on the USEOB includes offices like the Office of Ocean Exploration and the Integrated Ocean Observing System. Efforts are made to coordinate with the Navy for expertise in unmanned systems development and align with strategic priorities. The Secretary of Commerce for Operations and the Oceanographer of the Navy collaborate on strategic priorities for missions and geography within the Administration's purview. They aim to utilize Naval unmanned systems test ranges, maximize interagency cooperation, and formalize coordination with the Secretary of the Navy to incorporate Administration priorities into research and development activities. Consultation is intended to facilitate partnership in procuring unmanned maritime systems and establishing test ranges and facilities. The Administrator is authorized to procure unmanned maritime systems, operate test or training ranges, and collaborate with the Navy for research and development activities. The activities should ideally be carried out at a co-located facility to enhance efficiency and accelerate the development and integration of unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination in advancing unmanned maritime systems. They may also coordinate with academic research institutions for research, development, training, and commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. Facilitating commercialization of unmanned maritime systems through public-private partnerships involving academic research institutions, private industry, and public safety agencies. Arranging access to facilities for testing, training, and certification of unmanned maritime systems under various environmental conditions. Promoting engagement with academic institutions and information sharing between academic, environmental, and military institutions to enhance unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may engage with the private sector in carrying out these activities. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess their availability for Navy and Administration missions. Additionally, the Administrator will regularly assess publicly and commercially available unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, will assess the suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of unmanned maritime systems for meeting data specifications required by Administration programs. They will also evaluate the operational reliability and cost-effectiveness of these systems for making observations needed by the Administration. The Assistant Administrator and Director will work together to convene the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with various stakeholders for these assessments. Additionally, the Administrator will centralize and coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. A memorandum of agreement may be developed with the Secretary of the Navy for efficiency in procurement and sharing of systems. This Act does not modify Federal procurement law. Reports on unmanned maritime systems and their usage by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be provided. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON UNMANNED MARITIME SYSTEMS AND USAGE FOR MISSION OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION. The Administrator will submit reports on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for the Administration's mission every four years to Congress. The reports will include an inventory of current systems, data returned, benefits realized, and data requirements that could be met with unmanned systems. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator will use existing funds for this Act and may enter into contracts with governments, accept donations, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The Administrator can accept funds from other Federal departments and agencies, utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for funding, transfer appropriated funds to organizations, and use resources from various entities with their consent. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
