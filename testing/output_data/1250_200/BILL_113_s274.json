    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children Eating Well Act\" or the \"CHEW Act\". The Act, also known as the \"Children Eating Well Act\" or the \"CHEW Act\", defines terms related to education and nutrition programs. It includes programs that enhance students' ability to choose healthy foods, understand influences on healthy eating, and make informed decisions as adults using scientifically sound nutritional materials and methods. The \"Children Eating Well Act\" emphasizes the use of scientifically sound and developmentally appropriate nutritional materials supported by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. It also includes professional development programs for teachers and school staff to promote healthy eating and nutrition education effectively. Programs are established to promote healthy eating and nutrition education. Local educational agencies receiving assistance under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must develop and implement programs promoting healthy eating and nutrition education in schools. This includes integrating such programs throughout the school day and locations, as well as using educational materials emphasizing knowledge and appreciation of healthy foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables. The development of programs promoting healthy eating and nutrition education in schools involves a balanced approach to diet and lifestyle, integrating healthy eating with physical activity, and implementing various wellness activities to enhance student knowledge and skills. Local educational agencies must consult multiple viewpoints in developing these programs and periodically monitor schools' efforts in improving nutrition understanding among students. In developing programs to promote healthy eating and nutrition education, consultation with various stakeholders is essential. This includes working with organizations with nutrition expertise, government authorities, and community members to guide program development and implementation. In designing programs to promote healthy eating and nutrition education for schools, collaboration with Team Nutrition, State agencies, and school wellness councils is crucial. Integration with local school wellness policies and providing professional development on nutrition education to staff members are also key components. The Secretary of Education, Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a task force to review nutrition education curricula and recommend effective programs for schools. States must submit reports on promoting healthy eating and nutrition education, including monitoring data from local educational agencies. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2019."
