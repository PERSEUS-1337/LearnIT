    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use causes confusion among employers and employees, leading to increased worker exposure to injuries and illnesses. The lack of Federal standards for these warnings results in varying State requirements, prohibitions, and court decisions, creating a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and preempting any conflicting State standards. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include new subsection (h) requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of NIOSH, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract to protect against workplace hazards. Each standard issued under Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) must include warnings for personal protective equipment that describe actions, procedures, or prohibitions related to their use, with non-compliance potentially leading to injury or death. Manufacturers must communicate these warnings to employers, who must then relay them to employees and provide training on proper equipment use and the relevance of each warning in the workplace. The standards for personal protective equipment warnings must be followed by employers to ensure workplace safety. The warnings must be communicated by manufacturers to employers before the effective date, with exemptions for equipment already in interstate commerce. The Secretary considers various factors when promulgating these standards, including manufacturer experience and communication effectiveness. Experts, including the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, will provide written data and comments on the effectiveness of personal protective equipment warnings and communication methods. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 and Section 18 of the U.S. Code are amended to clarify that Congress intends to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and that no state or political subdivision can establish standards different from those set by the Secretary of Labor under section 6(h). The curr_chunk states that any plan must comply with occupational safety and health standards set by the Secretary under section 6(h), without any additional requirements."
