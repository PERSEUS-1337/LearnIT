    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section titled \"PART L--RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS\" with the addition of \"SEC. 10993. FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that there is a significant need for more mental health professionals in schools to address the lack of services for children, with the current student-to-counselor ratio being 513:1, far above the recommended ratio of 250:1. Existing counselors are overwhelmed with administrative tasks, and as student populations are expected to increase, the demand for school-based mental health services will also rise. The demand for school-based services for students is expected to significantly increase in the next few years. More than 100,000 new dedicated resource staff will be needed to reduce the student-to-staff ratio and improve academic achievement. Federal support for this initiative could lead to reduced violence and substance abuse. The purpose of this part is to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to work with students in grades 6-12 to reduce student-to-counseling ratios, address students' mental and emotional needs, and support school staff in early intervention and identifying signs of violence and mental health needs. The Secretary will provide grants to local educational agencies to support resource staff for students' needs, ensuring fair distribution nationwide. Grants will last up to 3 years, and agencies must submit applications describing the targeted student population and available counseling resources. The program must address the career development needs of the targeted student population, describe activities and services to be provided, outline methods for evaluating program outcomes, demonstrate qualified personnel, and ensure funds supplement non-Federal sources. Funds allocated to local educational agencies must be used for resource staff with mental health expertise in schools. These staff members must have specific qualifications, including licensure, certification, and relevant education. The text chunk outlines specific qualifications required for individuals providing mental health services in schools, including graduate education, supervised internship hours, and state licensure or certification. Additionally, funding authorization for these services is detailed for fiscal years 2002 to 2005 and beyond."
