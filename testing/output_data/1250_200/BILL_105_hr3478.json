    "content": "The \"Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998\" provide for a final settlement of the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes through reduced water supply facilities. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"Agreement,\" \"Animas-La Plata Project,\" \"Dolores Project,\" and \"Tribe; tribes.\" After the enactment of the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, the Secretary is required to construct a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acre-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. This project will also include a pumping plant and reservoir inlet conduit to provide municipal and industrial water allocations to the Southern Ute Tribe, not exceeding 16,525 acre-feet annually. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 allocate water to various tribes and entities, including the Southern Ute Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, Navajo Nation, San Juan Water Commission, and Animas-La Plata Conservancy District, with specific annual depletion limits. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 allocate water to tribes and entities, with nonreimbursable construction costs for the Navajo Nation and Tribes' water allocations. Nontribal water capital repayment obligations for the Animas-La Plata Project are to be satisfied by specific entities, including the San Juan Water Commission, Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District, and the State of Colorado. The State of Colorado entered into a cost-sharing agreement for the Animas-La Plata Project in 1986. Certain nonreimbursable costs for recreation, environmental compliance, cultural resources protection, and fish and wildlife mitigation are specified. Tribal water allocations from the project are exempt from reimbursing operation, maintenance, and replacement costs until the water is used by the Tribe. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 specifies that a Tribe is not required to reimburse the Secretary for certain project costs. Repayment of construction costs for the Dolores Project and annual operation costs begin when a Tribe uses its water allocation. Additionally, the Act allows for remaining water supplies to be requested by specific water conservancy districts. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 allow for water allocations to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico. The Secretary will provide water allocations not to exceed 5,230 acre-feet for Colorado and 780 acre-feet for New Mexico upon request. Additional water depletions may be permitted if consistent with the Endangered Species Act. The Secretary will make water allocations among beneficiaries of the Animas-La Plata Project as per agreements. The Secretary may transfer water rights to New Mexico beneficiaries to fulfill project purposes. Certain reports related to the project are to be treated accordingly. The April 1996 Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement and the February 19, 1996 Final Biological Opinion of the Animas-La Plata Project are deemed sufficient to meet requirements under various environmental acts for the project. The construction of facilities described in this section includes an aggregate depletion of 57,100 acre-feet of water approved in a biological opinion. The provision of water to the Tribes in accordance with this section constitutes final settlement of tribal claims to water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers. Nothing in this section affects the Tribes' right to water rights on other streams and rivers described in the Agreement. The Tribes' water rights on streams and rivers in the Agreement, excluding Animas and La Plata Rivers, are protected. The Attorney General will amend the consent decree in Water Division Number 7 of Colorado as per the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998. SEC. 4. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION; TREATMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS. The amendments made by this Act to section 6 of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement of 1988 do not affect the applicability of other provisions of the Act or the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to deliver water from the Dolores Project and complete construction of facilities on the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation as outlined in various Appropriations Acts. The uncommitted portion of the cost-sharing obligation of the State of Colorado, as referenced in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988, remains available for funding components of the Animas-La Plata Project not covered in the Act."
