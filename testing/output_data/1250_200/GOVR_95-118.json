    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC runs insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, insuring about 25,000 plans in FY2018. They pay benefits to 1.4 million people and provide financial assistance to multiemployer pensions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures 4,919 single-employer plans and provides financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most participants receive their full pension benefit, but 49% of terminated multiemployer plan participants may need future financial assistance. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. An Advisory Committee advises PBGC on various issues. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) made changes to the governance structures of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), including setting the Director's term at five years, requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times a year, and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting and funded through premiums from private-sector employers, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries. Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC as stated in ERISA. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is funded by premiums from private-sector employers who sponsor DB pension plans, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded pension plans. The sponsors of pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums based on plan underfunding. Premiums for 2019 include an annual $80 per participant for single-employer plans and an additional $43 for underfunded plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is funded by premiums from private-sector employers who sponsor DB pension plans. Premiums include flat-rate and variable-rate premiums based on plan underfunding. Single-employer plans pay an annual $80 per participant, with an additional $43 for underfunded plans. There are also termination premiums for single-employer plans and flat-rate premiums for multiemployer plans. PBGC only covers DB plans meeting IRC Section 401 requirements. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is funded by premiums from private-sector employers who sponsor DB pension plans. PBGC only covers DB plans meeting IRC Section 401 requirements, which must be established as permanent arrangements with determinable benefits and non-discriminatory practices. Plans excluded from PBGC coverage include governmental, church, and certain professional plans. PBGC operates single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs separately, with distinct reserve funds. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. Employers can voluntarily or involuntarily terminate single-employer plans, with PBGC involvement required. PBGC may terminate underfunded pension plans if the sponsor cannot fund its obligations. Companies can also voluntarily end pension plans if assets cover benefit liabilities. PBGC confirms termination requirements are met, including distributing benefits to participants. Assets exceeding liabilities can be recovered. The employer can recover excess assets through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. If a plan terminates underfunded, PBGC takes over and pays benefits from plan assets and employer recoveries. Guaranteed benefits are paid from PBGC's funds if needed. Distress Terminations allow employers to terminate a plan if they meet specific criteria, such as bankruptcy filings or approval from PBGC. Benefits owed to beneficiaries are paid from PBGC's funds if assets are insufficient. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 (SEPPAA) and subsequent acts set strict standards for PBGC to terminate underfunded plans. PBGC can terminate a plan involuntarily if it fails to meet funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner with large distributions, or poses a long-term loss to PBGC. PBGC can terminate a plan if it cannot pay benefits currently due, has unfunded vested benefits, or poses a long-term loss to PBGC. A federal court may also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid unreasonable financial deterioration. Since 1974, PBGC has become trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans due to terminations, with only a small fraction resulting in claims against PBGC. Following distress terminations, the plan sponsor and its controlled group members are liable for the plan's shortfall. Following a distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and every member of that sponsor's controlled group are liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the value of the plan's liabilities minus the fair market value of the plan's assets. The liability is joint and several, payable in cash or negotiable securities to PBGC. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the property of the contributing employer's controlled group. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC's benefits upon plan termination depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits. When an underfunded plan terminates, PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were nonforfeitable on the termination date, excluding benefits solely due to termination. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, including those starting before normal retirement age. Contingent benefits are guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before termination. PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited if the sponsor is in bankruptcy. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees for benefits over a five-year period. The maximum pension guarantee for single-employer plans is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in 2019, adjusted annually for wage growth. Benefits are adjusted based on the age at which a participant begins receiving them. The PBGC guarantees maximum pension benefits for individuals starting at ages 60, 65, or 70, with reductions for those starting before age 65. Only basic benefits are insured, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Vested benefits are also guaranteed, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. In FY2015, retirees received an average monthly benefit of $606 from PBGC. More than 80% of recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. PBGC also pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans by offering loans that are rarely repaid. If a plan recovers, it must repay the loans. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different guarantee ceiling than single-employer plans. Benefits for multiemployer plans are determined by a flat dollar rate multiplied by years of service. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, but only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. Participants in ongoing plans have almost twice the average benefit compared to terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for those receiving PBGC assistance in the future. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. The trust fund and revolving funds are PBGC's main assets, while its main liabilities are future benefit payments and financial assistance. The PBGC has had a deficit since FY2002 due to large plan terminations in the steel and airline industries. By FY2018, the single-employer program showed a surplus for the first time since FY2001. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. PBGC projects the multiemployer program to become insolvent in FY2025. Both programs are on the GAO's list of high-risk government programs. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015. In FY2015, approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC, with an average monthly payment of $536. The median monthly payment was $279. Retiree payees received an average monthly benefit of $606, while beneficiary payees received $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment, with an average amount of $2,054. The net financial position of PBGC's single-employer program improved over the years, showing a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018. This improvement was due to factors such as investment income and an increase in premium income. The multiemployer insurance program's financial condition has been worsening, with the deficit increasing from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $53.8 billion in FY2018. Factors contributing to this include investment income and an increase in premium income. In FY2018, 78 multiemployer plans received financial assistance, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants. The deficit spiked in FY2014 due to the likelihood of insolvency in large pension plans. The deficit in FY2014 was due to the increased likelihood of insolvency in large pension plans. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. Trust fund assets are managed by private-sector money managers according to an investment policy set by PBGC's Board of Directors. The PBGC's trust fund assets are managed by money managers based on an investment policy. The fund allocations are 30% for equities and 70% for fixed income, totaling $70.2 billion in FY2018. Three revolving funds, funded by pension plan sponsors' premiums, contain $33.2 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. These funds are used to pay benefits and are on-budget accounts. The PBGC's funds are on-budget accounts, with gross outlays including benefit payments and administrative expenses, and receipts from premiums, interest, and reimbursements. Recent premium increases have been criticized for offsetting federal spending and potentially discouraging employers from maintaining pension plans. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report estimated a shrinking deficit for the single-employer program and projected the multiemployer program to run out of money by FY2025. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. There is a high probability that the multiemployer program will be insolvent by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans. The multiemployer program's exposure to future financial assistance is estimated at $53.8 billion. Premium levels may not be enough to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce participant benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) allows insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans to reduce benefits to participants to prevent insolvency, potentially improving the financial condition of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to address concerns and formulate recommendations by November 30, 2018. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans was tasked with formulating recommendations and legislative language to improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation by November 30, 2018. However, they did not release a report with recommendations by the deadline. Historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
