    "content": "The paper introduces phredGAN, a system that extends the persona-based Seq2Seq neural network conversation model to multi-turn dialogues by modifying the hredGAN architecture. It includes a persona-based HRED generator (PHRED) and a conditional discriminator. Two approaches are explored for the conditional discriminator: $phredGAN_a$ passes attribute representation to an adversarial discriminator, while $phredGAN_d$ uses a dual discriminator to predict attributes. Performance is evaluated on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and TV series transcripts from Big Bang Theory and Friends, showing superior results over the persona SeqSeq model. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly with deep neural networks, have greatly advanced natural language processing and dialogue modeling research. However, developing a conversation model that can fluently interact between humans and machines is still in its early stages. Existing work often relies on limited dialogue history, assuming that model parameters can capture all dataset modalities. Yet, dialogue corpora are highly multi-modal, making it challenging for neural network models to disambiguate characteristics like speaker personality and location. Most research in this area has focused on optimizing dialogue consistency rather than capturing all modalities within a dataset. Recent advances in dialogue modeling research have primarily focused on optimizing dialogue consistency. For example, a Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED) network architecture has been introduced to capture long-term context within a dialogue. However, the HRED system lacks diversity and does not guarantee the generator output's calibration. To address these issues, a modified HRED generator alongside an adversarial discriminator has been trained to increase diversity and provide a strong guarantee to the generator's output. Additionally, recent work has integrated attribute embeddings into a generative dialogue model to capture persona-specific responses in datasets with multiple modalities. Recent advances in dialogue modeling research have focused on integrating attribute embeddings into dialogue models to capture persona-specific responses. Different approaches have been proposed, including models with Speaker-only representation, Speaker-Addressee model, and Responder-only representation. These models learn attribute representations during training, with some variations in how attributes are described. However, these persona-based models have limitations such as a single-turn dialogue history, exposure bias, and challenges in balancing personalization and conversation quality. The text discusses the limitations of persona-based dialogue models and proposes two variants of an adversarially trained persona conversational generative system, phredGAN a and phredGAN d. These systems aim to maintain response quality and capture speaker attributes within the conversation by using the same generator architecture with additional utterance attribute representation. The text introduces two variants of an adversarially trained persona conversational generative system, phredGAN a and phredGAN d, which incorporate attribute representation into the dialogue system. These systems aim to improve response quality and capture speaker attributes across conversation turns. The models are trained on datasets like the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and transcripts from TV series for evaluation, showing superiority over existing persona conversational models. The text introduces phredGAN a and phredGAN d, which enhance dialogue response quality by incorporating attribute representation. The models outperform existing persona conversational models in various metrics. The hredGAN BID8 formulates multi-turn dialogue response generation using conditional GAN structure. The dialogue model, phredGAN, utilizes a conditional GAN structure to generate output tokens based on observed dialogue history. The generator is trained to minimize cross-entropy loss and produce sequences indistinguishable from ground truth. The architecture includes additional input representing speaker and/or utterance attributes. The phredGAN model uses a conditional GAN structure to generate output tokens based on dialogue history, with additional input representing speaker and/or utterance attributes. The generator architecture includes an encoder that takes the source attribute as input and a generator decoder that takes the target attribute as input. The architecture involves attention mechanisms for sequences of tokens in both the encoder and decoder. The phredGAN model utilizes a conditional GAN structure to generate output tokens based on dialogue history, incorporating speaker and utterance attributes. The generator architecture includes an encoder for the source attribute and a decoder with attention mechanisms for the target attribute. Noise injection methods are explored, and the optimization objective involves adversarial and attribute prediction losses. The phredGAN a variant includes the target attribute as an additional input for the discriminator. phredGAN d utilizes an attribute discriminator, D att, in addition to the word-level adversarial discriminator D adv from hredGAN. The attribute discriminator operates on an utterance level to capture attribute modalities, using a unidirectional RNN to map input utterances to specific attributes. Attributes act as hidden states that shape generator outputs. The attribute discriminator in phredGAN d operates on an utterance level to capture attribute modalities, using a unidirectional RNN to map input utterances to specific attributes. The encoder RNN is bidirectional while the decoder RNN is a 3-layer GRU cell with hidden state size of 512. The system is trained end-to-end with back-propagation, sharing encoder, word embedding, and attribute embedding. The generator decoder RNN in phredGAN uses attention to combine attribute embeddings. The discriminator RNN includes a word-level discriminator and an attribute discriminator, both utilizing GRU cells with a hidden state size of 512. Parameters are initialized with Xavier uniform random initialization, and sampled softmax loss is used for MLE loss due to the large word vocabulary size. The model in phredGAN uses Xavier uniform random initialization for parameters and sampled softmax loss for MLE training due to a large vocabulary size. Training is done end-to-end with stochastic gradient descent in TensorFlow. Inference involves conditioning dialogue response generation on various inputs and using a linear search for optimal noise sample values. The study evaluates the performance of PHRED, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d on conversational datasets compared to non-adversarial persona Seq2seq models and adversarial hredGAN. Training is conducted on transcripts from TV series like Big Bang Theory and Friends, with a corpus of 5,008 lines split into training, development, and test sets. The final response is selected based on discriminator rankings. The study evaluates the performance of PHRED, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d on conversational datasets from TV series like Big Bang Theory and Friends. Training is conducted on a combined dataset with speaker IDs mapped to utterances, including the Movie Triplets Corpus and Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. The study evaluates the performance of phredGAN a and phredGAN d on conversational datasets from TV series like Big Bang Theory and Friends. The dataset includes utterances from UDC with two main speaker types, questioner and helper. Despite noise introduced by assuming only two speaker types, both models can differentiate between them. Evaluation metrics include perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, distinct n-gram, and NASL scores, along with human evaluation using crowd-sourced judges on 200 samples. The study compares non-adversarial persona HRED model, PHRED, with adversarially trained models hredGAN, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d. The models are evaluated by crowd-sourced judges on 200 samples based on response quality in terms of relevance, informativeness, and persona. Results are compared to Li et al.'s work BID5, which incorporates learnable persona embeddings in a Seq2Seq framework. The study evaluates the performance of phredGAN models with noise injection on TV transcripts and UDC datasets. Optimal noise variance values are determined for phredGAN a and phredGAN d, with phredGAN d performing best with word-level noise injection. Comparison is made against baselines PHRED, hredGAN, and Li et al.'s persona Seq2Seq models. The study compares the performance of phredGAN models with noise injection on TV transcripts and UDC datasets. Results show that phredGAN outperforms baselines like PHRED and hredGAN, especially when persona information is added. Despite some limitations with persona conditioning, phredGAN maintains the ability to produce diverse responses. The study evaluates the performance of phredGAN models on TV transcripts and UDC datasets. Despite some drawbacks with persona conditioning, phredGAN can still generate diverse responses. Comparing with S(A)M models, hredGAN performs better, showing improvements in various evaluation metrics except for distinct n-grams. PhredGAN dataset, with persona attributes, shows better response quality than hredGAN. PhredGAN strikes a balance between diversity and precision, especially with phredGAN d performing well. Recommendations include phredGAN a for weak attribute datasets and phredGAN d for strong attribute datasets. Human evaluation aligns with automatic evaluations, with phredGAN a performing the best on TV Series. The human evaluation scores align with automatic evaluations, showing phredGAN performing best on TV Series. However, on the UDC dataset, hredGAN and phredGAN perform similarly, indicating a trade-off between diversity and persona. Qualitative assessment in TAB2 shows phredGAN responses in TV series are more informative than BID5 Speaker-Addressee model. The phredGAN model demonstrates the ability to construct distinct attribute embeddings for each character, even with a limited dataset. It can infer the context of the conversation and important character information about the addressee. The model's responses on the UDC dataset show the ability to respond differently to input utterances while staying close to the conversation context. In this paper, phredGAN models improve persona-based response generation by introducing phredGAN a and phredGAN d, which show quantitative improvements over existing systems. These models can predict attributes intrinsic to input utterances and perform differently on datasets with weak and strong modality. Future work includes enhancing phredGAN d's ability to predict utterance attributes like speaker identity. The paper introduces phredGAN models to enhance persona-based response generation by improving attribute prediction and performance on datasets with weak and strong modality. The models demonstrate clear benefits from adversarial training and leave room for further advancements in this domain. The phredGAN models were trained on TV series and UDC datasets, generating responses based on persona attributes. The discriminator scores were reasonable, favoring longer, more persona-related responses. The responses showed contextual consistency, referencing background information in conversations. The phredGAN models generated responses based on persona attributes in conversations between speakers from TV series and UDC datasets. The responses showed contextual consistency and distinct communication styles between the interlocutors."
