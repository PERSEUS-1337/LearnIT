    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but there is a lack of general-purpose tools for this in the machine learning literature. A procedure is described for evaluating compositionality by measuring how well a model can approximate a collection of inferred representational primitives. This procedure is used to characterize compositional structure in various settings and explore its relationship with learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly in relation to compositionality. Compositionality allows for the representation of complex concepts by combining simple parts. While many machine learning approaches use human-designed compositional analyses, it is also important to explore how compositionality arises in learning problems without built-in structure. This is illustrated in a communication game scenario where an observation is encoded by a speaker model for a downstream task. The text discusses the need for a standardized, formal, and quantitative technique to evaluate claims about compositional structure in learned representations. It highlights the challenges in existing solutions and aims to address this by focusing on an oracle setting where the compositional structure of model inputs is known. The paper introduces a formal framework called TRE to evaluate how well representations reflect compositional structure in model inputs. It proposes optimizing over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model effectively. The paper introduces a formal framework called TRE to evaluate how well representations reflect compositional structure in model inputs. It proposes optimizing over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model effectively. The paper also presents experiments and analyses on the evolution of compositionality in relation to other model properties, tracking human judgments, constraining distances between representations, and the necessity of compositional representations for generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. The discussion revolves around the necessity of compositional representations for generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Various approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed, with a focus on when and how compositionality arises in models. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy offer evaluations of compositionality targeted at formal and natural languages. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy offer evaluations of compositionality targeted at formal and natural languages. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of general case procedures for answering questions about compositionality in various ways. One class of evaluations derives judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces, while another exploits task-specific structure to provide evidence of compositionality. Our work aims to offer a standard and scalable alternative to these model- and task-specific evaluations. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model- and task-specific evaluations in natural language processing. It focuses on learning composition functions for distributed representations of phrases and sentences, complementing existing frameworks. Our work presents a framework for compositional representation learning in NLP, which complements existing techniques. It demonstrates the ability to adapt NLP methods for compositionality evaluation in non-linguistic settings, such as a communication task involving speaker and listener models. The goal is to assess the compositionality of representations generated by these models. The section proposes an automated procedure for determining if the oracle analysis of input structure is reflected in the representations produced by a model. It assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs labeled with tree-structured derivations. The section proposes an automated procedure for determining if the oracle analysis of input structure is reflected in the representations produced by a model. It assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs labeled with tree-structured derivations. Inputs are labeled with tree-structured derivations defined by a set of primitives and a bracketing operation. The model is considered compositional if it is a homomorphism from inputs to representations. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in identifying lexicon entries and composing meanings in language understanding problems. It also mentions the difficulties in dealing with languages that exhibit regular structures but do not fit the homomorphism condition. The example in Figure 1 illustrates the process of identifying primitive representations and composing them to produce full representations. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation procedure for measuring compositionality in language understanding problems. It introduces the Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a method to assess the quality of approximating the true predictor with compositional models. The evaluation procedure for measuring compositionality in language understanding problems introduces the Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a method to assess the quality of approximating the true predictor with compositional models. The evaluation metric TRE(X) captures the intuition behind the constructability of representations from parts by explicitly optimizing over parameters \u03b7i. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates compositionality in language understanding models by optimizing over parameters \u03b7i. The choice of composition function * is crucial to avoid trivial solutions, especially when learning it. Models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and * can solve Equation 2 using gradient descent. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates compositionality in language understanding models by optimizing over parameters \u03b7i. Implementation details include using gradient descent for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and *. For discrete \u0398, a continuous relaxation can be found for differentiability. An SGD-based TRE solver is provided in the software release. Task-specific optimizers can be applied to Equation 2. The paper discusses using TRE to address compositionality questions in machine learning problems, focusing on the information bottleneck theory of representation learning. The framework proposes that learning in deep models involves an error minimization phase followed by a compression phase, where irrelevant information is discarded to isolate decision-relevant attributes. The model predicts classifiers in a meta-learning framework for compositional visual concepts. The model is trained to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. The curr_chunk discusses the compositional structure and evaluation of a model trained on visual concepts. It includes details on the attributes used, training dataset size, validation accuracy, and the relationship between information bottleneck and compositionality. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average over ten training runs. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between reconstruction error and mutual information in the context of compositionality. It shows that as training progresses, both metrics increase and then decrease together, indicating the discovery of compositional representations. The next investigation focuses on high-dimensional word and phrase embeddings in natural language processing. The curr_chunk explores the compositional nature of phrase representations in natural language processing by using reconstruction error to differentiate between compositional and non-compositional bigrams. The goal is to validate this approach and integrate it into the existing framework of compositionality in language processing. Training embeddings for words and bigrams is done using the CBOW objective in FastText. The current paper proposes a framework for training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective in FastText with 100-dimensional vectors. The compositional structure is examined by comparing bigram-level judgments of compositionality with human ratings. The results replicate previous findings within the tree reconstruction method. The study examines compositionality by comparing human ratings with tree reconstruction error (TRE) scores. Results show an inverse correlation between TRE and compositionality judgments. Collocations like \"application form\" are rated as most compositional, while \"fine line\" is rated least compositional. The paper also explores topographic similarity and its relation to compositionality through oracle derivations. The distance function in this section aims to clarify the relationship between derivational similarity and edit distance. A tree edit distance is used to equip the space of derivations, with the claim that representations cannot be much farther apart than the derivations that produce them. Proof is provided in the appendix. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between compositionality, generalization, and communication games. It explores how compositionality imposes constraints on similarity judgments between representations and evaluates the claim that agents need compositional communication protocols to generalize to unseen referents. The experiments involve training a large number of agents from random initial conditions to measure the compositional structure of the language that emerges and its impact on performance with familiar and novel objects. The curr_chunk discusses training agents to measure the compositional structure of language in communication games. A speaker describes objects to a listener who reconstructs them for rewards. Policies are trained using a discrete communication protocol, with RNNs implemented for the speaker and listener. The policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective BID48, with RNNs implemented for the speaker and listener. Each target referent consists of two objects with two attributes, and a subset of object pairs is held out for evaluation. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes, and agent messages are represented as sequences of one-hot vectors with a composition function involving different operations. The composition function in the agent messages involves one-hot vectors and matrices to redistribute tokens in the input string. Compositional languages show lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs. Two multiagent training runs result in languages with different Token Reward Efficiency (TRE) but similar listener performance. The elements of D0 can be arbitrary for computing TRE via gradient descent. The two languages have different Token Reward Efficiency (TRE) but similar listener performance. By allowing arbitrary vectors for computing TRE, both \u03b4 and * have subgradients that can be optimized. Results from training 100 speaker-listener pairs show a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. TRE is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies. The text discusses Token Reward Efficiency (TRE) in relation to generalization performance in language strategies. It introduces a new evaluation method called TRE for assessing compositional structure in representation learning problems. The method infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. The analysis applies TRE to various representation learning problems, exploring compositionality in learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization.
