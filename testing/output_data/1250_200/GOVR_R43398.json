    "content": "The federal government has been involved in collecting educational statistics for over 150 years. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the 1970s to centralize research efforts. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) replaced NIE in 2002, operating as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. It created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director and oversee research priorities. ESRA also established three National Education Centers and later added a fourth center for Special Education Research. Additionally, P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. It created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director and oversee research priorities. ESRA also established three National Education Centers and later added a fourth center for Special Education Research. Along with ESRA, P.L. 107-279 enacted two additional acts\u2014the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA authorizes grants for technical assistance activities and data systems, while NAEPAA authorizes national and state assessments in reading and mathematics. ESRA led to the creation of an independent research institute and specified \"scientifically-based\" standards for research, giving IES more freedom from the Department of Education. ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education, providing more freedom from ED. ESRA also requires adherence to scientifically based research standards and methodological rigor for IES-supported research. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA has continued through annual appropriations legislation. The House of Representatives passed the Strengthening Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366) in the 113th Congress. The House of Representatives passed the Strengthening Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366) in the 113th Congress, and the Senate adopted a similar bill (S. 227) in the 114th Congress. Both bills aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, amending provisions related to IES independence, research standards, evaluation, privacy protection, and student assessment oversight. The report provides a concise description of these programs and authorities, aligned with P.L. 107-279, which enacted the measures. The Strengthening Education through Research Act (ESRA) authorizes the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to provide national leadership in education research. IES aims to inform parents, educators, and policymakers on education progress and effectiveness through statistics, research, and evaluations. The IES Director is appointed by the President and carries out duties such as proposing research priorities and ensuring objectivity in activities. The ESRA authorizes the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to set research priorities, establish review procedures, advise on research matters, and ensure objectivity. It also establishes the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director on policies and funding, assess progress, and recommend improvements. ESRA specifies requirements for Board members and IES is composed of four research centers. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is composed of four research centers: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). Each center has specific duties outlined in the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA). NCER sponsors research to improve student academic achievement and access to high-quality education. NCER is responsible for improving student academic achievement, closing the achievement gap, and enhancing access to postsecondary education. It supports research synthesis, peer-review processes, and the dissemination of scientifically valid research findings. The Commissioner of NCER can support up to eight national research centers focusing on various education topics. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) focuses on various education topics such as early childhood development, improving low-achieving schools, teacher quality, and reading. Research and development centers address national needs through competitive grants for up to five years. NCER also oversees the collection and analysis of education information with high methodological standards. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects and analyzes education information with high methodological standards. Its primary duty is to report education statistics from preschool to adulthood objectively and timely. Other duties include publishing reports on collected statistics, setting standards for state educational agencies, and comparing student achievement with other nations. The Commissioner of NCES can award grants, contracts, and provide technical assistance to carry out these duties. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is authorized to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance for collecting data on various education topics such as student achievement, school violence, teacher supply, education financing, and more. Data must be disaggregated by gender, race, and ethnicity. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is authorized to collect data on education topics such as student achievement, school violence, teacher supply, and education financing. The data must be disaggregated by various demographics for educational and policy decision-making purposes. ESRA Part D authorizes the National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) to support evaluation, technical assistance, development, and dissemination activities to determine the impact of federal education programs on student academic achievement. The National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) is authorized to conduct evaluations on federal education programs, particularly those under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. NCEE must adhere to high standards of quality and peer review for evaluations. The Regional Educational Laboratories (REL) program provides technical assistance, with the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) entering into contracts with 10 RELs to serve children nationwide. The Director must design objectives and indicators for RELs to assess their performance in providing research, technical assistance, and training to education agencies. RELs facilitate communication between experts and educators, conduct research, and disseminate educational practices to meet regional needs. The Commissioner of NCEE oversees independent evaluations of RELs and reports results to Congress. NCSER sponsors research to improve services for individuals with disabilities and evaluates the implementation of IDEA. NCSER's duties include improving services under IDEA, identifying scientifically based practices for academic achievement, and aligning state standards. The National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) focuses on promoting participation in general education, aligning state standards for students with cognitive disabilities, addressing overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities, improving personnel preparation, and addressing the special needs of limited English proficient children with disabilities. NCSER conducts research, awards grants, and disseminates findings in accordance with established standards. ESRA Part F outlines provisions on confidentiality, data availability, performance management, and staffing considerations. The ESRA Part F outlines provisions on prohibitions, confidentiality, availability of data, performance management, authority to publish, staffing considerations, and authorizations of appropriations. $400 million in appropriations were authorized for ESRA activities for FY2003, with additional funding for RELs. Title II of P.L. 107-279, the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA), authorizes grants for technical assistance and evaluation to local entities and states for data systems. Funding has continued through annual appropriations legislation since the authorities expired in FY2008. The Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) authorizes 20 grants for comprehensive centers to provide training, professional development, and technical assistance for ESEA programs. Each center must coordinate activities with local agencies and establish an advisory board. The Secretary conducts evaluations and reports to congressional committees. ETAA also allows for competitive grants. The Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) authorizes grants for comprehensive centers to provide training, professional development, and technical assistance for ESEA programs. The Secretary conducts evaluations and reports to congressional committees. ETAA also allows for competitive grants to SEAs for statewide longitudinal data systems. Funding has continued through annual appropriations legislation. Title III of P.L. 107-279 establishes the National Assessment Governing Board and charges the Commissioner of Education Statistics with conducting the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) oversees the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which includes national and state assessment programs for reading and mathematics. Participation in NAEP is voluntary for students, schools, and local educational agencies. The Assessment Board formulates policy guidelines for NAEP with input from various stakeholders. The Assessment Board, consisting of a variety of stakeholders, is responsible for selecting subject areas to be assessed, developing student achievement levels, creating assessment objectives and test specifications, and ensuring the validity and reliability of the assessment. The Director of IES is a nonvoting member of the Board. The National Assessment Governing Board includes technical experts in measurement and assessment, content and subject matter, and sampling. They measure student academic achievement in grades 4, 8, and 12, develop guidelines for reporting results, and plan the initial public release of reports. Funding for these activities has been ongoing through annual appropriations legislation. The Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366) and a similar bill in the Senate (S. 227) aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, making changes to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. Both bills proposed giving the Director of IES more authority and amending provisions related to NBES independence. Both bills propose adding new requirements for the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) to have at least two board members who are practitioners knowledgeable about US education needs. They also amend provisions for the IES Director's term limits and involvement in contracting processes. Additionally, both bills require IES to establish a peer review system for grants and contracts exceeding $100,000. Both bills propose new requirements for IES grants and contracts over $100,000 to be awarded through a peer review process. They also redefine \"scientifically based research standards\" as \"principles of scientific research,\" emphasizing causal relationships with research designs like random assignment experiments. The bills adjust IES research priorities and emphasize eliminating competing explanations for results. Both bills propose adjustments to IES research priorities, focusing on educational problems and issues relevant to federal laws. They eliminate specific priorities and the requirement for a set number of national research centers. The bills also redefine the mission of RELs to conduct applied research and development activities. Both bills propose changes to the Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), limiting the number to not more than 10 and assigning some technical assistance responsibilities to the Comprehensive Centers. S. 227 would give the Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner authority to determine the appropriate number of RELs and reorganize them based on performance indicators. H.R. 4366 would limit the number of Comprehensive Center awards to \"not more than 17.\" H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose changes to the number of Comprehensive Center awards, with a limit set at 17. The Secretary would have the authority to adjust the number of centers based on performance indicators and regional needs. Both bills aim to designate IES as the primary entity for research on federal education programs and reserve funds for program evaluations. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose allocating a small percentage of funds for evaluations of programs authorized under ESEA. They both require a biennial ESEA evaluation plan submission to Congress and clarify the protection of individuals' privacy in data collection. Additionally, they amend the role of the National Assessment Governing Board and mandate evaluations of National Education Centers by an independent entity tied to a performance management system. H.R. 4366 suggests a triennial evaluation, while S. 227 suggests once every five years. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose an expanded performance management system for evaluations of National Education Centers. H.R. 4366 suggests a triennial evaluation, while S. 227 suggests once every five years. The system aims to promote continuous improvement through measurable performance indicators and ties renewal of grants to progress on these indicators. Renewal authority for NCER national research centers and Statistics Commissioner grants would be up to two years under both bills. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose extending the renewal authority for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under the Statistics Commissioner to up to two years. Recipients of renewal awards would need to show progress in meeting ESRA's performance management system requirements. The bills also require the Director to report public information on all awards within 120 days and codify data access regulations. Appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA would be authorized at specific levels for FY2015 through FY2020. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose extending the renewal authority for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under the Statistics Commissioner to up to two years. Appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA would be authorized at specific levels for FY2015 through FY2020."
