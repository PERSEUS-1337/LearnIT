    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Howard M. Metzenbaum \"Menu Education and Labeling Act\" or the \"MEAL Act\". Congress acknowledges the strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity rates in the United States. Obesity is associated with various health risks and has significant economic costs. The prevalence of meals prepared or eaten outside the home has increased over the past two decades. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease also leads to significant healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt. Nutrition information is required on packaged foods, but not on restaurant foods unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Most adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Consumers find it challenging to limit calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information availability. Studies show that consumers want nutrition information when ordering at restaurants to make informed decisions. Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increased availability of nutrition information to reduce obesity. The Secretary of Health and Human Services suggests increasing access to nutrition information for foods consumed outside the home to combat obesity. SEC. 3. Nutrition labeling of standard menu items at chain restaurants.

Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must disclose nutritional information for standard menu items, including calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium content in a standard serving. The information should be displayed clearly on menus or menu boards to help the public understand its significance in the context of a total daily diet. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations are required to disclose nutritional information for standard menu items, including calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium content. This information must be displayed clearly on menus or menu boards. Certain items like condiments and daily specials are exempt from this requirement. Self-service facilities like salad bars are also included in the regulation. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must display nutritional information for standard menu items, including calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium content. Self-service facilities like salad bars must also provide calorie information per standard serving. Additionally, restaurants can voluntarily offer more nutrition information, and states can impose additional requirements on food establishments. The Secretary must propose regulations within 1 year and finalize them within 2 years to ensure food establishments provide nutrition information beyond the required standards. The final regulations under item (III) must be issued within 2 years of enactment. For vending machines operated by businesses with 20 or more machines, a sign must be displayed near the food item if it cannot be examined before purchase. The vending machine operator must display a sign near the article disclosing the calorie count. Vending machine operators can voluntarily provide additional nutrition information that complies with requirements. States can also impose additional nutrition information requirements. Proposed regulations must be issued within 1 year of enactment. The Secretary must issue proposed regulations within 1 year of enactment and final regulations within 2 years. If final regulations are not issued on time, proposed regulations will become effective as final regulations."
