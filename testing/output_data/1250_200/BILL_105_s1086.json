It outlines circumstances for the US President to modify laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Congress findings highlight the binding international agreement between the UK and China regarding the reversion of Hong Kong in 1997. China pledged autonomy and human rights protections for Hong Kong in the agreement. Despite China's assurances of a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty and the implementation of the \"one country, two systems\" policy, there have been official acts and statements infringing upon Hong Kong's autonomy. These include attempts to obtain confidential files on civil servants and dissolve the democratically elected Legislative Council in 1997. The Republic of China dissolved the democratically elected Legislative Council on July 1, 1997, and appointed a provisional legislature in December 1996. Officials delineated permitted speech and association types after reversion, issued initial warnings to religious institutions, and decided to repeal or amend certain Hong Kong ordinances in February 1997. Despite commitments in the Joint Declaration, there have been official acts infringing upon Hong Kong's autonomy. The Order Ordinance of 1995 and official acts of the UK Government have damaged Hong Kong's autonomy. The reversion to China has implications for US national interests. The United States Government has a responsibility to protect US interests and the human rights of the Hong Kong people during and after the transition.
