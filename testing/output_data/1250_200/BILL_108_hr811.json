    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Medical Access Raising Test Scores Health Act\", or the \"SMARTS Health Act\". The Congress finds that protecting children's health requires a caring adult and a connection to school. Schools are vital for community support and promoting health. Primary care and behavioral health services are crucial for children's well-being. School safety and violence prevention are essential, with early intervention reducing discipline problems. Good health is necessary for optimal learning. Effective mental health care in schools can reduce discipline problems and promote academic success by addressing behavioral and physical illnesses like ADHD, asthma, and obesity. Prevention strategies should be community-based, and schools are ideal settings to provide care for children. School-based health programs should focus on improving behavioral and physical health, including obesity, to prevent disease and reduce the need for treatment. Community-based prevention programs, whether through schools or other approaches, result in significant cost savings for the Federal Government and States, which should be reinvested in further prevention efforts. Prevention programs in Federal and State health services should lead to cost savings that are reinvested in further prevention efforts, without being redirected to unrelated purposes or penalizing successful programs with reduced funding levels. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS FOR EXPANSION OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide demonstration grants to eligible entities to expand school-based health programs. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education or local educational agencies. Coordination with various health programs is required. The Act allows for demonstration grants to expand school-based health programs for eligible entities like public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education or local educational agencies.
