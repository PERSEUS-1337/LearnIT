    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act (Chapter 6.3) is added to the Fish and Game Code to conserve oak woodlands for various benefits including enhancing scenic beauty, promoting ecological balance, and improving the health and welfare of California residents. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodlands in California to prevent fragmentation caused by pathogens and parasites, maintain ecosystem health, and provide habitat for wildlife species. The Act emphasizes the importance of preserving oak woodland ecological attributes and supporting wildlife associated with this habitat. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodland ecological attributes in California, provide habitat for wildlife species, ensure land use decisions are based on scientific information, and restore the state's diverse natural resource for future generations. Key terms include canopy cover, oak removal, oak removal permit, and oak removal plan. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines key terms such as oak removal plan, oak tree, oak woodland, parcel, riparian hardwood, and timberland. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines terms like \"Timberland\" and \"Watercourse.\" It prohibits the removal of certain oak trees without an approved oak removal plan and permit application. The plan must be prepared by a registered professional forester and submitted on a form prescribed by the director. Applications for oak removal permits must be on a prescribed form. The commission will adopt regulations by June 30, 2016, including an application fee to cover processing costs. The fee will be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund for department use. An oak removal plan must be submitted with an application for an oak removal permit, including details such as parcel use, canopy cover percentages, oak species to be removed, and habitat mitigation measures. The director's approval of the permit is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act, and certain criteria must be met for approval. The director cannot approve an oak removal permit if the application and plan do not comply with regulations, findings cannot be made, more than 10% of oak canopy would be removed, trees are within 50 feet of water, information is incorrect, applicant lacks property interest, or plan violates laws. Dead tree removal and creating fire breaks are exceptions. The applicant can appeal the director's denial of an oak removal permit to the commission within 15 days. The commission will hear the appeal within 60 days unless a later date is agreed upon. An applicant denied a permit is entitled to a hearing before the commission. A person can take legal action to stop violations of oak removal regulations. Oak removal permits approved under this chapter are considered construction projects. In civil actions seeking injunctions, it is not necessary to prove irreparable damage or inadequate legal remedy. The permittee must record the approved permit in each county before starting operations. Violations of this chapter may result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation, separate from any other penalties imposed by law. In civil actions brought under this section, the court considers various factors in determining civil penalties, including the nature of the violation, ability to pay, prior history of violations, and economic benefit gained. The Attorney General or other designated authorities may bring civil actions on behalf of the State of California, and collected penalties are apportioned accordingly. Civil penalties collected under this section are apportioned as follows: 50% to the county treasurer for the fish and wildlife propagation fund, and 50% to the Wildlife Conservation Board for the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund. Section 21083.4 of the Public Resources Code is repealed. Oak trees are defined as native Quercus species over 5 inches in diameter at breast height. County determination under Section 21080.1 assesses if a project may impact oak woodlands. Mitigation options include conservation easements, tree planting with maintenance for seven years, and restoration of former oak woodlands. Mitigation under tree planting can only fulfill half of the requirement for the project. The county can use various mitigation measures to protect oak woodlands, including contributing funds to the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund for purchasing conservation easements. Additionally, counties can use grants to develop oak conservation plans exempt from certain requirements. Exempt from the section are projects under approved conservation plans, affordable housing in urban areas, conversion of oak woodlands on agricultural land, and projects under specific codes. Lead agencies and projects implementing oak mitigation measures are compliant with the division regarding oak effects. The Legislature clarifies that the section does not alter requirements of the division, except for impacts on oaks and oak woodlands. It also does not prevent the application of Section 21081 to a project. The section and related regulations do not limit a public agency's ability to comply with the law. No reimbursement is needed for local agencies or school districts due to this act, as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
