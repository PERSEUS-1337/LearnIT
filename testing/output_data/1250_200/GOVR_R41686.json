    "content": "The United States has two tsunami warning centers managed by NOAA's National Weather Service. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii monitors and issues warnings for the Pacific basin, while the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska covers the West Coast and Alaska. The PTWC also monitors the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Caribbean Sea. Established in 1949 after a tsunami hit Hawaii, the PTWC took over tsunami monitoring for Alaska until the WC/ATWC was created in 1967. The NTWC, formerly the WC/ATWC, was established after the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. It issues tsunami warnings for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, California, U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Atlantic coast of Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. and British Virgin Islands. The centers monitor seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood and transmit warnings to relevant authorities. The Tsunami Warning Centers monitor seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood and transmit warnings to relevant authorities. When a tsunami is likely, a warning message is sent to NOAA's weather forecasting offices, state emergency management centers, and other recipients. Data from tide-level gauges and DART buoys are used to confirm tsunami generation or cancel warnings. The DART system was expanded after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System and improve tsunami detection and warning capabilities. The DART system was expanded after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to improve U.S. tsunami detection capabilities. There are now a total of 60 DART buoys globally, with 39 in the U.S. and 21 in other countries. Legislation requires NWS to prioritize maintaining tsunami detection equipment. As of November 2015, 4 out of 39 U.S. buoys were not operational, an improvement from March 2015. Inoperable buoys would not necessarily hinder tsunami warnings, which rely primarily on seismic data. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) was established in response to the threat of tsunamis in the Pacific Northwest from the Cascadia subduction zone. The program assists states in emergency planning, develops tsunami inundation maps, and conducts outreach and education programs. NOAA's goals for the NTHMP include raising awareness, creating integrated tsunami maps, and promoting disaster preparedness. NOAA's NTHMP aims to raise awareness, develop tsunami maps, improve warning systems, and integrate tsunami planning into multi-hazard programs. The program coordinates activities, including detection, warning, forecasts, communication, outreach, education, and research. Congress has raised concerns about the maintenance and availability of the DART buoy network. In the appropriations bill, the House Appropriations Committee criticized NOAA for not meeting its network availability standard despite full funding in FY2014. Congress prioritized maintaining tsunami detection equipment in previous legislation. Bills in the 114th Congress addressed DART buoy maintenance and NTHMP issues. The House and Senate passed legislation amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, authorizing appropriations through FY2017 or FY2021. Both the House and Senate passed bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act to authorize appropriations for the NTHMP through FY2017 (H.R. 34) or through FY2021 (S. 533). The bills would broaden the program to include a focus on tsunami research and outreach, streamline language, and add a new subsection emphasizing research efforts related to improving tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, and response. The House and Senate passed bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act to improve research efforts related to tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, mitigation, resiliency, response, outreach, and recovery. Both bills streamline language and update subsections, with the Senate version requiring 80% operational capacity for DART buoys and cooperation among NOAA, USGS, and NSF for seismic information. The House bill does not include these provisions but both rename subsection (c) to Tsunami Warning System, expanding forecasting capabilities to Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic Oceans, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. Subsection 4(d) in both bills explicitly names the NTWC. The House and Senate bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act focus on improving research efforts related to tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, mitigation, resiliency, response, outreach, and recovery. Both bills require coordination with the NWS and include provisions for enhancing forecasting capabilities in various ocean regions. The House bill adds subsections for fail-safe warning capability and coordination with the NWS, NTHMP, and NOAA for resource allocation. The Senate bill emphasizes using data for new inundation estimates and coordinating with the Coast Guard. The House and Senate bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act focus on improving coordination with the NWS and enhancing forecasting capabilities. The House bill directs the NWS to coordinate with tsunami warning centers, while the Senate bill requires the NOAA administrator to coordinate with the NWS and other program offices. The Senate bill also emphasizes regional and local forecast offices implementing mass communication tools for timely tsunami warnings. Both bills omit certain reporting requirements from a previous law. The technology developed under the tsunami research program is being transferred to operations. The House and Senate bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act focus on improving coordination with the NWS and enhancing forecasting capabilities. The House bill omits subsections 4(g) through 4(k) in Section 4 of P.L. 109-424, while the Senate bill omits subsection 4(g) and subsections 4(i) through 4(k) but retains subsection 4(h) for congressional notification in case of impaired forecasting capabilities. Both bills require consultation with relevant agencies to conduct a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program. The bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act focus on improving coordination with the NWS and enhancing forecasting capabilities. They would require consultation with relevant agencies to conduct a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program, including providing technical and financial assistance to coastal states, territories, tribes, and local governments. Additionally, the Senate-passed bill would require evaluations and technical assistance for vertical evacuation structure planning in communities at risk. The bills amending the Tsunami Warning and Education Act focus on improving coordination with the NWS and enhancing forecasting capabilities. They would require consultation with relevant agencies to conduct a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program, including providing technical and financial assistance to coastal states, territories, tribes, and local governments. Additionally, the bills would add authorized activities for the program, such as vulnerability research, risk management training, and development of technologies. States could designate at-risk areas based on local conditions, and a report on accreditation of the TsunamiReady program would be required within 180 days of enactment. The TsunamiReady program would be accredited by the Emergency Management Accreditation Program with support from NOAA and other federal agencies. The research program would be expanded to include mitigation research, near-field tsunami detection, forecasting improvements, and validation of tsunami maps and models. The House-passed bill includes a provision for a pilot project in the Cascadia region to develop near-field tsunami forecasting capability. The Cascadia subduction zone has the potential for major earthquakes and tsunamis, as evidenced by a large earthquake and tsunami in 1700. Both bills update language and require NOAA to coordinate with the U.S. State. Both bills aim to update language and require NOAA to coordinate with the U.S. State Department for technical assistance to international oceanographic entities. They also establish a new advisory panel for tsunami science and preparedness, with regular reviews and recommendations to be submitted to Congress. Both bills would require NOAA to submit a report to Congress on progress in implementing the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, detailing resources, dissemination of guidelines, and development of technical basis for validation of tsunami maps and forecasts. The report must also describe ways to standardize tsunami warnings with other natural hazards. The Senate-passed bill includes provisions for national efforts supporting rapid emergency response after a domestic near-shore tsunami event. It authorizes appropriations for tsunami activities for three years at $27 million each year, with specific allocations for the NTHMP and Tsunami Research Program. The Senate bill extends the program for six years, while both bills require NOAA to coordinate with state and local emergency managers to improve tsunami education and outreach. The House-passed bill reauthorizes the NOAA administrator to convene a coordinating committee to assist with the administration of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP). The committee would include representatives from states at risk from tsunamis and provide feedback on fund prioritization, ensure participation in the tsunami warning system, make recommendations to improve the TsunamiReady program, and advance the NTHMP. The House bill reauthorizes the NOAA administrator to convene a coordinating committee for the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The committee includes representatives from states at risk from tsunamis to provide feedback on fund prioritization, ensure participation in the tsunami warning system, make recommendations to improve the TsunamiReady program, and advance the NTHMP. Funding for the NOAA Tsunami Program is maintained at $27 million for FY2015, supporting maintenance for the DART buoy network and restoring proposed reductions to NTHMP grant funds. In FY2015, NOAA allocated $31.4 million for tsunami activities, with $12.2 million for Observations PPA and $19.2 million for Analyze, Forecast, and Support PPA. The FY2016 budget request was $6 million less than FY2015, reducing NTHMP grant funds. NOAA's tsunami program historically supports warning, mitigation, and research activities. The NOAA budget for tsunami activities increased significantly after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, from $27 million in FY2005 to $42 million in FY2009. Funding allocation shifted towards warning activities, increasing from 40% in FY2004 to 70% in FY2009, while mitigation funding decreased from 50% to 30%. Research funding remained steady at 6-10%."
