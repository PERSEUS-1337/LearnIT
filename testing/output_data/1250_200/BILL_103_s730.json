    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers, causing financial losses and difficulties in implementing domestic support programs. The Act aims to address unfair provisions in the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement that have led to increased Canadian grain exports and depressed domestic grain prices. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers by seeking consultations with Canada on price setting policies of the Canadian Wheat Board and exclusion from transport rates for agricultural goods shipped to the US. However, progress on these consultations has been lacking, leading to a flawed outcome. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 seeks consultations with Canada on price setting policies of the Canadian Wheat Board. The failure to pursue these consultations led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.\n\nThe President must negotiate with Canada to determine the price of agricultural goods sold by the Canadian Wheat Board to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, and grain imports will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed.\n\nSEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President must negotiate with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act that are shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain receiving transport rate benefits will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the meaning of \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers, and other incurred costs. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. Title II of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires Federal agencies to assist petitioners in countervailing duty or antidumping actions related to Canadian subsidies on wheat and barley exports to the US. Additionally, Title II promotes the use of export enhancement programs to boost grain exports. Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the United States by allowing exporters to compete effectively with Canadian grain exporters, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The requirements of counteracting transportation subsidies and wheat sales by the Canadian Wheat Board will apply until agreements are reached with the Government of Canada. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Title XV of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to include a new subtitle called \"Agricultural Export Program Protection\" with defined terms. The \"Agricultural Trade Program\" refers to various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation under different acts such as the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, Agricultural Act of 1949, and Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. The term 'covered foreign commodity' refers to wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. 'Entry' means the import or withdrawal from warehouse. 'Person' includes exporters and participants in agricultural trade programs. 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses of covered foreign commodities such as wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. The text chunk discusses the requirements for end-use certificates for covered foreign commodities and the submission of quarterly reports by consignees to certify the usage of these commodities. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports for covered foreign commodities must include the importer and consignee's name and address, country of origin, description, quantity, and purpose of the commodity. The quarterly report for covered foreign commodities must include class, quantity, purpose of use, transporter identification, end-use certificates held by consignee, quantity used per certificate, and use made by consignee. The quarterly report for covered foreign commodities must include details such as quantity used, exports, commingling with US commodities, transfers to subsequent consignees, and changes in end-use. The Secretary may also require reporting of sales prices if necessary for enforcement. The Secretary may require an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities to enforce trade laws and agreements. Confidentiality of purchasers must be maintained, and entry of such commodities is prohibited without the certificate. Penalties apply for violations, including customs penalties and civil penalties for non-compliance with Secretary's requirements. The Secretary may impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for knowingly violating requirements under this section. Regulations will be prescribed for the preparation and submission of quarterly reports. \"Compliance provisions under section 402 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized in this subtitle. Suspension or debarment may occur for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs.\" The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from an agricultural trade program for misusing foreign agricultural commodities. A waiver may be granted if the person proves the misuse was unintentional and involved less than 1% of the total commodity quantity. The suspension or debarment of a person under an agricultural trade program will not affect their liability for any other penalties imposed for the misuse of foreign agricultural commodities. This section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The suspension or debarment of a person under an agricultural trade program will not affect their liability for any other penalties imposed for the misuse of foreign agricultural commodities."
