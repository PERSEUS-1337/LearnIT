    "content": "This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles, the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The provisions focus on federal forest management, forest assistance programs, and forestry research. The report primarily examines the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, focusing on federal forest management by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It covers laws like NEPA and HFRA, detailing changes in project planning, fire management, forest programs, and more. The report discusses forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, covering fire management, restoration programs, and more. It highlights changes made in project planning and potential issues for Congress. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre NFS are forests and woodlands, with Congress directing management to protect watersheds and provide timber for US citizens. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 authorized the sale of trees and added various uses for national forests. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each NFS unit, developed with public involvement and compliance with cross-cutting laws. The FS must comply with cross-cutting laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA when taking discretionary actions. Forest plans outline resource conditions but do not authorize specific projects. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, must align with forest plan objectives and follow FS procedures for compliance. Timing and review scope vary based on statutory authority and potential resource impacts. BLM manages public lands under multiple use and sustained yield principles, similar to NFS. Oregon and California Railroad Lands are managed for permanent forest production, providing timber, protecting watersheds, and supporting local economies. FLPMA directs BLM to prepare resource management plans and revise them as needed for on-the-ground activities. FLPMA directs BLM to prepare and maintain resource management plans for on-the-ground activities, ensuring compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions. Actions with significant impacts require an EIS, while uncertain impacts may need an EA or FONSI. Agencies must evaluate proposed actions and alternatives. The Decision Notice is a key part of the agency's decision-making process for actions requiring an EA or EIS. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with minimal environmental impact that do not need an EIS or EA. Agencies like FS and BLM have identified CEs based on past experience, with some established by Congress. Agencies may determine additional documentation needed for a CE, with FS distinguishing between actions requiring further documentation or a decision memorandum. In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations identify resource conditions termed extraordinary circumstances that may warrant further analysis in an EA or EIS. These conditions include flood plains, endangered species habitat, wilderness areas, and archaeological sites. The NEPA process helps identify environmental impacts and other requirements for a project. The NEPA process helps identify environmental impacts and requirements for a project, serving as an umbrella compliance process. Compliance with NEPA triggers additional environmental review requirements under other laws like ESA and NHPA. HFRA expedites planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability. HFRA expedites planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on federal lands by authorizing specific projects covering up to 20 million acres. It defines terms like At-Risk Community and Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects, which include methods such as prescribed fire and mechanical methods for reducing hazardous fuels. Methods for reducing hazardous fuels include prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods like pruning or thinning. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to assess fire patterns and prioritize fuel reduction projects. Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) refers to areas near at-risk communities where fuel reduction projects may be conducted. These projects can also target areas with significant departure from historical fire regimes or lands at risk of insect or disease damage. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels on land at risk of damage, excluding designated wilderness areas. Projects must align with land management plans and prioritize thinning, prescribed fire, and tree removal to modify fire behavior. An objection process allows for review of proposed projects within 30 days of draft decision documents publication. The objection process for HFRA projects allows for objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents associated with the proposed project. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. Judicial review is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. Only issues raised during the public comment period and administrative review may be considered during judicial proceedings. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all FS projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. FS has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide for insect and disease treatment areas based on declining forest health and risk of tree mortality. The FS has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide as I&D areas for projects prioritizing insect and disease infestations. Projects must follow HFRA guidelines, including collaboration with government entities, consideration of best available science, and retention of old-growth trees. Projects within the WUI require analysis of proposed actions and alternatives, with a focus on at-risk communities. The FS has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide as I&D areas for projects prioritizing insect and disease infestations. Projects within the WUI require analysis of proposed actions and alternatives, with a focus on at-risk communities. Congress authorized FS to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as I&D areas and prioritize projects through an expedited process. As of March 2019, FS reports 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states proposed under these authorities, with some projects evaluated using EA analysis procedures and others using EIS. The 2018 Farm Bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, allowing certain projects to reduce insect or disease infestations in I&D areas without NEPA requirements. These projects are exempt from pre-decisional administrative review objections. To be eligible, projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider the best available science, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. No new permanent roads can be established, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. The 2018 Farm Bill added Section 603 to HFRA, allowing projects to reduce insect or disease infestations in I&D areas without NEPA requirements. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. No new permanent roads can be established, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in areas classified as Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Group I, II, or III. FS policy requires documenting decisions using the Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities, including the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects to include fuel breaks. The 2018 Farm Bill amended HFRA to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. Priority projects in I&D areas were reauthorized through FY2023. Hazardous fuels reduction projects can use the Farm Bill CE in I&D areas. A new statutory NEPA CE was established, along with provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The 2018 Farm Bill established new statutory CEs for expedited project planning and implementation, including wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for FS and BLM. The potential impact of these CEs on project pace and forest management goals is uncertain. These CEs allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned more efficiently, with some arguing it will help achieve landscape-level goals. The 2018 Farm Bill established new statutory CEs for expedited project planning and implementation, including wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for FS and BLM. Some argue that larger project sizes with a CE will help achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently and improve agency efficiency. However, concerns exist about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews, which may lead to undesirable resource effects. Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus added a new Section 605 to HFRA, establishing a Wildfire Resilience CE for specified hazardous fuel reduction projects. The FY2018 omnibus added a Wildfire Resilience CE to HFRA for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. No new permanent roads are allowed, and projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres. Maintenance of existing roads is permitted. The Wildfire Resilience CE under HFRA allows for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands within designated areas. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. No new permanent roads are allowed, and projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads may be performed as needed. Projects located within the WUI are prioritized, but projects outside the WUI can be considered if they meet specified fire regime condition classes. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report on the use of CEs authorized under this section. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 using this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in areas with high wildfire hazard potential within the WUI. It is specifically for hazardous fuels reduction projects and requires evaluation of extraordinary circumstances. The Farm Bill CE, on the other hand, is broader and includes projects for insect and disease infestation. Both CEs require assessment for extraordinary circumstances. The 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Projects must be consistent with resource management plans and comply with specific requirements, such as removal of nonnative vegetation. Projects are not allowed in designated wilderness areas or areas with restricted vegetation removal. Projects under the 2018 farm bill CE must adhere to specific guidelines, including not occurring in designated wilderness areas or areas with restricted vegetation removal. They must also comply with resource management plans, decommission temporary roads within three years, and not exceed 4,500 acres in size. Additionally, projects on NFS lands are limited to designated I&D areas and must consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and habitat restoration. The CE also requires a 20-year monitoring plan and collaboration in project development. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems, administered by FWS and NMFS. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions and exemptions for federal agencies. Agencies must ensure actions do not harm species or their habitats. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure that their actions do not harm endangered or threatened species or their habitats. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, results in a biological opinion that specifies terms and conditions for the action to proceed without jeopardizing the species. If the action is deemed to harm the species, alternative solutions must be suggested. The majority of consultations end with no harm to the species. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon, specifying that consultation is not required for plan updates unless certain conditions are met. This has sparked controversy as some argue it sets a new precedent. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing for flexibility in plan implementation without requiring consultation for species listing or critical habitat designation. Supporters argue it will reduce delays and maintain plan consistency, while opponents fear it could harm species by allowing potentially harmful activities to continue unchecked. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing flexibility in plan implementation without requiring consultation for species listing or critical habitat designation. Critics argue this could harm species by allowing harmful activities to continue unchecked. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities, with specific provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill for wildfire suppression funding, risk mapping, and reporting requirements. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing flexibility in plan implementation without requiring consultation for species listing or critical habitat designation. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for DOI is provided to the department, which then allocates the funding to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Overall, appropriations to the Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion of the increase attributed to rising suppression costs. This has led to instances of \"fire borrowing\" when suppression funding is exhausted, prompting concerns that increased suppression spending may impact other agency programs. Congress has often provided supplemental appropriations to repay these borrowed funds. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budgetary constraints in the FY2018 omnibus. Discretionary spending is currently subject to statutory limits, and exceeding these limits may result in sequestration. Congress has sometimes waived controls for wildfire spending, leading to concerns about the impact on other agency programs. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, exempt from discretionary spending limits, starting in FY2020 through FY2027. This adjustment covers emergency wildland firefighting activities and necessary funds for repayment of costs. The new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, starting in FY2020 through FY2027, exempts funding above the 10-year average spending level from discretionary limits. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress can appropriate funds above the FY2015 baseline for suppression operations, up to the specified maximum, without being subject to discretionary spending limits. The wildfire funding fix allows for additional appropriations above the baseline amount for suppression operations, up to $2.25 billion in FY2020. This adjustment exempts the funding from discretionary limits until FY2021, potentially providing up to $3.64 billion in total for suppression efforts. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress regarding accountability and the need for additional funding beyond the baseline amount for suppression operations. Congress may need to take additional action to ensure agencies have access to funds for continued federal services in response to wildfires. The FY2020 wildfire funding fix raises concerns about accountability and oversight of suppression spending, as appropriations are now tied to the FY2015 baseline. The baseline and annual adjustment limits lack ties to inflationary factors, and the fix does not address various concerns related to suppression costs, such as forecasting, evaluating methods, and addressing cost drivers. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index uses data on likelihood, intensity, and past wildfire locations to assess the potential for difficult-to-contain wildfires. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified as high or very high WHP, with 53% on federal lands. High WHP indicates fuels with a higher chance of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. The index, when paired with spatial data, can estimate wildfire risk to resources. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard maps for community use within two years. The Forest Service is directed to consult with partners to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for at-risk communities near NFS lands. Reports on wildland fire management are required by the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill, with the first report due by December 30, 2021 if the wildfire funding fix is used. The reports must be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director and submitted to specific House and Senate committees. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land to be submitted to specific House and Senate committees. The report must analyze wildfire funding usage, wildland fire management spending, suppression management decisions, and lessons learned from large fires. The 2018 farm bill requires a report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land to be submitted to specific House and Senate committees. The report includes details on acres treated for wildfire, insect infestation, disease prevention, fire risk levels, wildfire impact on treated and untreated land, federal response time for large fires, timber production, road and trail maintenance needs, water quality measures, and ecosystem restoration activities. Forest restoration activities aim to improve ecosystem function and resilience on federal land by establishing or reestablishing necessary ecological processes. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density, using prescribed fires to manage vegetation buildup and wildfire risk, and facilitating post-fire recovery. The authority for these projects comes from laws such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the Organic Administration Act of 1897. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are mandated to protect national forests, manage them for multiple use and sustained yield, and maintain forest conditions for diverse plant and animal communities. Congress has authorized various forest restoration programs, including watershed condition framework, water source protection, Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority. These programs allow FS and BLM to partner with stakeholders to identify and address forest restoration needs. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have various forest restoration programs, including the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale. These programs aim to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect and disease infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities. Stakeholders support these programs, although some have raised concerns about specific aspects. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes. The collaboration process for developing restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes must be inclusive, transparent, and meet RAC requirements. Priority landscapes should be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands needing restoration, accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. Proposals must incorporate best available science, focus on old-growth stand restoration and hazardous fuel reduction. No new permanent roads can be established, and temporary roads must be decommissioned. Annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports are required by law. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) requires the submission of annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports to congressional committees. The program allows the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for 10 years. The program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019 and is considered successful in achieving land management objectives. The CFLRP received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019, perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives and contributing to local economies. The dedicated funding provided long-term stability for project implementation. However, some feel it falls short in fostering new markets for wood products and resolving complex issues with community stakeholders. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. It allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years, with the possibility of more projects being selected and funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. Additionally, the bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements with state governments for land management on NFS and BLM lands. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years. States are authorized to do restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands under approved GNA, including treating insect- and disease-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and other activities to improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health. The law prohibits treatments in designated wilderness areas and does not include construction, repair, or restoration of paved roads. FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws and approving silvicultural prescriptions. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows states to work on NFS and BLM public lands under approved agreements with FS or BLM. MAs and SPAs outline project scope and terms. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering various activities like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and others. GNA is seen as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources, although funding and resource capacity vary among states. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill made changes to the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), allowing forest restoration activities to include road work and expanding the availability of GNAs to tribes and county governments. Funds received through timber sales under a GNA can be used for additional projects, and payments made by counties are not subject to revenue-sharing laws. This expansion has the potential to significantly increase the use of the authority. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) has the potential to increase cross-boundary restoration work and leverage nonfederal resources. Concerns include increased administrative demands on FS or BLM and the distribution of receipts from timber sales. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, allowing FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals. FS and BLM can enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals, combining timber sale contracts with service contracts. This allows them to use harvested timber value to offset service costs. Goals include improving water quality, forest health, soil productivity, watersheds, fish and wildlife habitats, and native plant species. Any excess revenue from timber sales can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other projects. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to use excess revenue from timber sales for other projects without further appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance and proposal quality. Annual reports are required on contract development and accomplishments. Stakeholders generally view stewardship contracting favorably, citing increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Some express concerns about incentives for large-scale removal of trees. Some concerns exist regarding stewardship contracting, including the incentive to remove ecologically important trees for funding service work, distribution of receipts, upfront financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. Initial challenges in integrating contract types and record-keeping have been addressed, with agencies improving systems and offering more contracts annually. However, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The OIG report identified issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. New guidance was published in 2016 in response to the report's findings. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas, with a procurement preference for innovative forest product use. Cancellation ceilings were also allowed, with excess revenues used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. The law authorizes FS and BLM to enter stewardship contracts with cancellation ceilings, allowing funds to be obligated in stages. This can help resolve concerns about upfront financial obligations. The use of 20-year contracts and procurement preference may increase market certainty for forest products industries. Protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs. The NFS has identified drawbacks in its watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach. To address these issues, FS developed a Watershed Condition Framework to classify and prioritize watersheds, develop restoration plans, and implement projects to achieve program goals. The Forest Service began developing watershed restoration action plans in 2013 and implementing projects soon after. A 2017 USDA OIG report highlighted management inadequacies in the WCF program. The 2018 farm bill codified the program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities. The law authorized the establishment of a WCF for NFS land, allowing FS to evaluate watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans. The Forest Service can develop, implement, and monitor restoration action plans for protection and restoration of national forests and grasslands. They may prioritize protection and restoration activities on priority watersheds and authorize emergency designation for watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. Water source protection is an authorized activity, allowing cooperative agreements for watershed restoration with various entities if in the public interest. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into partnership agreements with nonfederal partners for watershed protection and restoration projects. FS can develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to improve resources on NFS lands within the watershed. The law authorizes FS to conduct a single environmental analysis for each project. The 2018 farm bill authorizes the Forest Service to conduct environmental analysis for water source management plans and projects on NFS lands. It allows FS to accept cash, donations, and assistance from partners to implement the plan, with a Water Source Protection Fund to match donations. Congress allocated $10 million annually to the Fund through FY2023. Other provisions in the bill relate to federal forest land, including designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and various land management activities. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on NFS lands in Tennessee, including the Upper Bald River Wilderness and additions to Big Frog, Big Laurel Branch, Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain. These areas are managed according to the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The bill also enacted provisions changing how FS and/or BLM acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land. The 2018 farm bill included provisions that changed how FS and/or BLM acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land. These provisions established, reauthorized, or modified specific authorities, such as leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites, reauthorizing programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands, and modifying existing FS programs. The 2018 farm bill expanded the eligibility requirements for the FS program and authorized exchanges or sales for specific parcels and entities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands for various purposes, including water infrastructure, electricity generation, communication systems, and transportation facilities. The FS and BLM charge fees for processing applications and monitoring activities related to infrastructure projects such as electricity generation, communication systems, and transportation facilities. Fees are based on estimated hours and land value, with separate schedules for different types of uses. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their fee schedule for communication sites and issued new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to update regulations for activities within electricity ROWs and utility ROWs, aiming to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe administrative processes hinder necessary maintenance activities, while others place responsibility on permit holders. The provisions are seen as potentially improving approval processes for ROW permit holders. Some provisions in the 115th Congress aim to improve processes for right-of-way (ROW) permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Concerns exist regarding the balance between expediting project implementation and maintaining accountability. Specific provisions address responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and liability costs for ROW permit holders, with some worried about the potential implications for the federal government bearing a disproportionate share of these costs. Others believe limiting damages and liability will encourage prompt agency action on maintenance requests from ROW permit holders. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process to issue special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands within one year of enactment. The law specified that the new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized across the NFS, and lease terms must be for a minimum of 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on the cost of processing and monitoring applications and approvals. The regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing and monitoring costs for communication sites on federal lands. A new account in the Treasury will be used for managing communication sites activities. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to include a new section on Vegetation Management, Facility Inspection, and Operation and Maintenance for electric transmission facilities on federal land. Guidance must be issued for planning and implementing these activities within ROWs. The law requires FS and BLM to review, approve, and modify plans for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their ROW with an approved plan. Certain management activities can be conducted without approval in specific circumstances. The Secretaries must propose regulations within one year and finalize them within two years. Training programs for employees on vegetation management and electrical systems are encouraged. Liabilities for ROW permit holders are specified in the FY2018 omnibus. The FY2018 omnibus specified ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities in the ROW, including addressing the relationship between permit holder liability and plan approval status. The law prohibits strict liability for damages exceeding $500,000 resulting from activities conducted by a ROW holder under certain conditions for ten years. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress within four years. Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, with specific requirements for the program. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) lands. Participants can develop vegetation management plans, conduct projects within their ROWs, and adhere to fire prevention regulations. Participants are responsible for project costs, with potential funding from the Secretary of Agriculture. The Forest Service must report on the program's status to Congress biennially. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) lands. Participants are responsible for reimbursing the Forest Service for wildfire suppression costs and damage caused by their operations. The program limits reimbursement costs to $500,000 in certain circumstances and participants can receive credits for providing resources to suppress wildfires. The program differs from the FY2018 omnibus program, which is specific to electricity ROWs and caps liability. The 2018 farm bill pilot program limits participant responsibilities to wildfire and vegetation management on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands. Counties receive payments based on revenue generated, with SRS offering an optional payment system. SRS payments are allocated for education, roads, projects on lands, and specified county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Title II of the 2018 farm bill established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice for specified county programs such as fire prevention and emergency services. RACs consist of 15 members representing various interests, and payments are set at 95% of the previous year's level. SRS payments were extended until FY2016, after which counties receive lower revenue-sharing payments. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with FY2017 payments being made in two installments. The reauthorization also expanded the uses for Title III funds and changed payment allocation requirements. The reauthorization expired at the end of FY2018, with no additional payments authorized after FY2018 payments are distributed in FY2019. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with FY2017 payments made in two installments. Changes were enacted to the SRS statute despite its expiration, including modifications to RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for RAC member appointments in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on NFS and BLM lands. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary to enter into self-determination contracts with federally recognized tribes for forest projects on NFS land, in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for forest projects on NFS land under the ISDEAA. The law delegates responsibilities to the Secretary of Agriculture, retains decision-making authority over NEPA and TFPA, and addresses concerns with federal forest management, including a backlog of restoration treatments on high-risk NFS lands. The Forest Service aims to increase forest management projects to address hazardous fuel accumulation. Administrative barriers, including decision-making processes and funding issues, hinder progress in implementing restoration treatments. NEPA implementation and public challenges also contribute to planning delays. Stakeholders identify administrative barriers like inadequate funding and training hindering efficient project planning. Provisions by the 115th Congress aim to expedite planning processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction. Some argue that expanding authorities under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act would speed up project implementation, while others raise concerns about changes to decision-making processes impacting federal forest management. Expanding these authorities could lead to environmental impacts worsening forest conditions. Some stakeholders argue that expanding authorities under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act could worsen environmental impacts and exacerbate forest health concerns. Issues such as deteriorating forest health conditions and high fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, with recommendations made in the past to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop strategies to mitigate wildfire risk. The FS' hazardous fuels reduction program needs better guidance and controls for project identification, prioritization, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. Previous reports have highlighted issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have been ongoing, with challenges and appeals affecting a significant percentage of fuel management projects. Academic studies suggest that more complex projects are more likely to face challenges. The Hazardous Fuels Reduction Program faces challenges in project implementation, with complex projects more likely to be challenged. Despite efforts to expedite project implementation, the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to increase. The effectiveness of the HFRA approach is debated, with some suggesting a broader application of the legislation. Comparisons of forest-related provisions in recent laws show changes in forest management approaches."
