    "content": "A focus on U.S. rules governing imports from North Korea has been sparked by the debate over the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). The agreement's opponents argue it could increase U.S. imports of goods from North Korea, but historically, the U.S. imports very few finished goods from North Korea due to trade restrictions. Since 2005, only $8,363 worth of stamps have been imported from North Korea to the United States. Finished imports from North Korea have been virtually zero in four of the past five years. Concerns about the KORUS FTA focus on the potential for South Korean firms to use goods from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea to benefit the North Korean government. The report examines U.S. rules on imports from North Korea, focusing on the Kaesong Industrial Complex and China. It also discusses the potential impact of the KORUS FTA on U.S. imports of North Korean content. Despite requiring licenses for imports from North Korea, the U.S. no longer has a comprehensive embargo on the country. President Clinton loosened restrictions in 1999, and President Bush further relaxed them in 2008. In 2008, President Bush removed Trading With the Enemy Act authorities and state sponsor of terrorism designation for North Korea, allowing for some trade relations. Importing from North Korea had been restricted since the Korean War, but import restrictions remained due to missile proliferation activities. President Obama also invoked national emergency authorities in 2010. In 2010, President Obama invoked national emergency authorities to block assets of individuals and entities engaged in missile proliferation activities and prohibited imports from North Korea. The North Korean government made provocative decisions from 2008 to 2010, including testing ballistic missiles and claiming to have detonated a nuclear device. In 2010, President Obama invoked national emergency authorities to block assets of individuals and entities engaged in missile proliferation activities and prohibited imports from North Korea. North Korea made provocative decisions, including testing ballistic missiles, claiming to have detonated a nuclear device, sinking a South Korean naval vessel, and launching artillery shells at a South Korean island. The importation of goods from North Korea into the United States is strictly regulated, requiring approval from OFAC. The importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States is prohibited, regardless of any prior contracts or licenses. OFAC prohibits transactions prohibited by previous Executive Orders and is authorized to issue licenses for transactions with North Korea. The President can revise or revoke the executive order if national emergency conditions change, with annual renewal required for the order to remain in force. The importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States is prohibited, regardless of any prior contracts or licenses. Importers must have OFAC approval to bring North Korean goods into the US through a third country. Executive orders invoking a national emergency require annual renewal to remain in force. The President can revise or revoke the order if national emergency conditions change. The importation of goods from North Korea into the United States is prohibited, requiring OFAC approval even if done through a third country. OFAC plans to enhance regulations to address issues like North Korean component parts in third-country manufacturing. North Korea's isolated economy and self-reliant policy limit its commercial and financial relations with other nations. If North Korea's export sector grows, U.S. regulatory requirements may be affected. North Korea's industrial base has been shrinking since the late 1980s, leading to limited commercial and financial relations with other countries. By 2010, most of North Korea's exports were to South Korea and China, with exports to South Korea increasing by 25% since 2006. The Kaesong Industrial Complex played a significant role in these exports, with over 120 South Korean companies operating there in 2010. The complex mainly produced clothing, textiles, kitchen utensils, auto parts, and semiconductors, generating $323 million in output. In 2010, the Kaesong Industrial Complex generated $323 million in output. Most manufacturers produce clothing, textiles, kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. About 10% of the production is exported to third countries, with primary destinations being Australia, the European Union, Russia, and China. The complex's future depends on inter-Korean relations and South Korean leaders' policies. President Lee Myung-bak's government has been ambivalent about the complex, halting plans for expansion due to deteriorating relations since 2008. The Kaesong Industrial Complex has seen halted expansion plans due to deteriorating inter-Korean relations. Despite this, President Lee Myung-bak did not shut it down after significant incidents in 2010. The complex poses a dilemma for U.S. and South Korean policymakers as it provides revenue to the North Korean regime. The future of the complex remains uncertain as Lee's term ends in 2013. The Kaesong Industrial Complex generates revenue for the North Korean regime through salaries of workers. South Korean and U.S. officials estimate the revenue to be around $20 million per year. The complex could potentially lead to market reforms in North Korea and expose North Koreans to outside influences. China plays a significant role in North Korea's economic relations, with over half of its imports and most foreign assistance coming from China. North Korean exports to China have increased significantly, with mineral fuels, ores, and apparel being major export items. North Korea's exports to China include mineral fuels, ores, apparel, iron, steel, fish, and seafood. They have also increased exports of primary and mineral products. Pyongyang imports aquaculture technology and agricultural equipment from China to boost production. Chinese firms partner with North Korea for coal and mineral exports, providing modern equipment in exchange. North Korean content in the global marketplace via China mainly comes from energy inputs and mineral deposits. China is looking to create an integrated industrial region with North Korea, focusing on Jilin and Liaoning provinces. The strategy involves investing in North Korean industries, building roads, and establishing a free trade zone. Chinese companies are engaged in various sectors in North Korea, including mining, agriculture, industrial parts, apparel, and consumer goods. The possibility of building an industrial park similar to the Kaesong Industrial Complex is being explored, which could lead to more Chinese companies manufacturing products in North Korea for export to the U.S. market. North Korean exports of apparel, consumer goods, automotive parts, and industrial materials could potentially enter a Chinese supply chain and reach the U.S. market. Critics of the KORUS FTA argue that it may allow North Korean goods to enter the U.S. through preferential treatment, limit restrictions on imports from North Korea, and lack clear rules of origin. During the KORUS FTA negotiations, the U.S. opposed preferential treatment for products from North Korea. A compromise was reached on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, creating a special committee. Annex 22-B of the KORUS FTA addresses the establishment of outward processing zones on the Korean Peninsula. The establishment of outward processing zones (OPZ) on the Korean Peninsula under the KORUS FTA involves a Committee on Outward Processing Zones to identify designated OPZs, set criteria for goods to be considered originating, and determine compliance with labor and environmental standards. The committee will meet annually to oversee the development of OPZs for economic benefits. The Committee on Outward Processing Zones under the KORUS FTA sets criteria for goods to be considered originating, establishes maximum thresholds for input values, and makes decisions by unified consent. Recommendations are made to the United States and South Korea for legislative approval of any amendments related to outward processing zones. The USTR stated that Congress would need to pass a law to extend tariff benefits to products made in Kaesong or any OPZ, and OPZ goods would need to be deemed admissible before tariff treatment can be determined. The United States must first deem North Korean components admissible before determining applicable tariff treatment. Congress has the authority to impose duties and must authorize specific tariff rates or grant the President the authority to do so. Goods from countries subject to Title IV of the Trade Act, like North Korea, can only receive NTR (MFN) treatment under specific requirements. The President must abide by Title IV requirements to grant NTR tariff status to a Title IV country unless Congress removes a country from the regime. Imports not subject to Title IV or other restrictions are entitled to NTR tariff status at most. Preferential tariff rates to imports from any country must be expressly authorized. The extension of preferential tariff rates to imports from any country must be expressly authorized under the Trade Act of 1974. Presidential proclamation authority in KORUS FTA legislation may only apply to goods originating from South Korea. Critics have called for renegotiation to exclude products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. South Korea has agreed to modifications in the past, but supporters argue against further changes. The KORUS FTA's supporters reject the need for further modification, citing existing rules to restrict imports from North Korea. The agreement is unlikely to constrain the US from restricting imports of goods with North Korean components. Article 2.8.1 of the KORUS FTA aligns with WTO agreements, prohibiting quantitative import restrictions beyond duties or taxes. Article 2.8.1 of the KORUS FTA prohibits import restrictions beyond duties or taxes, including quotas or import licenses. Import prohibitions cannot be applied to goods of the other Party, which may include final goods of South Korea made with components from a third country. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in the agreement, such as allowing a Party to limit or prohibit imports from a non-Party without violating the agreement. The KORUS FTA allows for import restrictions beyond duties or taxes, including quotas or import licenses. The agreement permits a Party to limit or prohibit imports from a non-Party without violating the agreement, even if it affects trade with the other KORUS FTA Party. This provision applies to all U.S. import embargoes, including those with Cuba and Iran. The term \"good of the non-Party\" includes non-Party components used in third-country production. The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did not override existing Cuban sanctions. The CFTA emphasized that it would not affect Cuban sanctions, allowing restrictions on Cuban products or goods made from Cuban materials. Similar provisions were included in NAFTA to prevent the importation of Cuban products. The KORUS FTA provision allows for restrictions on imports from North Korea based on national security considerations, similar to provisions in the CFTA and NAFTA regarding Cuban sanctions. The agreement separates admissibility from tariff treatment, indicating that the origin of a good does not determine its admissibility into the US or South Korea. The \"essential security\" exception in the KORUS FTA may also be invoked in such cases. The KORUS FTA security exception allows for restrictions on imports based on national security concerns, similar to provisions in the CFTA and NAFTA. The clause may be invoked in disputes between the US and South Korea, or in investor-state disputes. The KORUS FTA security exception allows for restrictions on imports based on national security concerns in disputes between the US and South Korea or in investor-state disputes. The exception would justify measures without examining if they fall within its scope, potentially preventing dispute settlement proceedings from being initiated if the responding Party indicates it will invoke the exception. The KORUS FTA security exception allows for restrictions on imports based on national security concerns. Critics argue that South Korean manufacturers may use North Korean components in exports to the US. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the country of origin of products for various purposes. ROO are used by customs officials to enforce trade restrictions, assess tariffs, apply trade remedies, and collect statistics. Determining origin can be complex when products have components from multiple countries, such as in the automotive sector with its extensive global supply chain. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the country of origin of products, especially in cases where North Korean components are involved. Preferential ROO are used to determine eligibility for preferential treatment under the FTA, excluding products from non-signatory countries and protecting import-sensitive domestic industries. Importers must demonstrate compliance with ROO to receive favorable tariff treatment. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining product origin and eligibility for favorable tariff treatment. Preferential ROO are tailored to each FTA party, requiring a percentage of inputs from the US or South Korea. This incentivizes manufacturers to use US or South Korean inputs over those from non-signatory countries like North Korea or China, depending on tariff differences. Compliance with ROO is essential for cost-saving on tariffs under the KORUS FTA. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin (ROO) determine product eligibility for tariff benefits. Meeting ROO requirements allows for cost-saving on tariffs, benefiting manufacturers in the US and South Korea. Chapter 7 of the KORUS FTA enhances cooperation between customs officials, facilitating information sharing and enforcement of regulations. The KORUS FTA's Chapter 7 enhances customs cooperation between the US and South Korea, facilitating technical advice sharing, joint training programs, and efficient enforcement of regulations. This may limit the entry of North Korean-manufactured goods into the US. Congress could direct CBP to require additional certification from South Korean exporters or conduct more audits on importers applying for preferences under the FTA. The KORUS FTA's preferential terms do not apply to finished goods made in the KIC, with provisions allowing the US to block inclusion of the KIC in the agreement. The agreement aims to preserve US restrictions on North Korean imports, with rules of origin applying only with OFAC licenses. The focus on handling imports from North Korea centers on customs controls and cooperation. The issue of handling imports from North Korea focuses on customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement. U.S. restrictions on North Korean imports have not been significantly challenged due to minimal exports of manufactured goods. However, if North Korean industry revives, circumventing import restrictions could become a bigger problem. There is no foolproof way to ensure goods or components from North Korea do not enter U.S. commerce without proper authorization. The challenge in preventing North Korean goods from entering U.S. commerce without authorization is exemplified in the automobile supply chain. Chinese or South Korean producers could source components from North Korea and evade U.S. customs by not reporting them. Enforcement depends on U.S.-South Korea customs cooperation and penalties for non-compliance."
