    "content": "Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children who cannot safely remain in their own homes. The child welfare agency's goal is to provide necessary services for the child to return to their parents. If reunification is not possible, the agency works to find a permanent home through adoption or legal guardianship. States receive federal funding for child welfare services under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The Title IV-E program provides federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship to eligible children. In FY2011, states spent $12.4 billion under the program and received federal reimbursement of $6.7 billion. The program is administered by the Children's Bureau at the federal level and by state child welfare agencies at the state level. The child welfare agency, part of the state's human services department, administers the Title IV-E program. State agencies oversee the program, with two-thirds of funds supporting foster care. Most children receiving adoption assistance were previously in foster care. The report discusses how children enter foster care, state requirements for federal funds, and authorized uses of Title IV-E dollars. The majority of the report focuses on Title IV-E program eligibility criteria and spending specific to foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Child welfare agencies conduct around 2 million family investigations annually to address child abuse or neglect concerns, with neglect being the most common issue reported. Investigative caseworkers often find underlying factors like high stress, low social support, and financial difficulties that contribute to child abuse/neglect investigations. After investigations, 87.1% of children remain at home, 6.1% are in informal kinship arrangements, and 6.3% are in formal out-of-home placements. Risk factors for child abuse and neglect include high stress in the family, low social support, financial difficulties, substance abuse, history of domestic violence, mental health problems, and caregiver arrest. These factors are more common in families where children are removed from the home after an investigation. There was no significant difference in the presence of domestic violence in families where children were removed or remained in the home. The Title IV-E program funds foster care maintenance payments to provide financial assistance for children in foster care. The goal is to reunite children with their parents, but funding can only be used for services for children who meet eligibility criteria. Post-reunification services are not covered by Title IV-E funding. States may rely on various federal funding streams, such as Title IV-B and other sources like TANF and SSBG, to support child welfare programs. Title IV-E funds adoption and kinship guardianship assistance to establish new permanent families for children who cannot return home. Under Title IV-E, states provide financial assistance to eligible children after they leave foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship. Post-adoption or post-guardianship support services are not covered by Title IV-E funds, but can be supported by child welfare programs under Title IV-B, TANF, and SSBG. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides unique support for youth aging out of foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program operates separately from Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, with its own requirements and funding rules. Title IV-E is a joint federal-state program that provides reimbursement for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship services for eligible children. Indian tribes also have access to Title IV-E funding since FY2010. The Title IV-E program, authorized for Indian tribes since FY2010, requires tribes to meet similar program requirements as states to receive funding. Only one tribe had an approved tribal Title IV-E program as of early September 2012, but more tribes are working towards approval. The program, established in 1980, provides federal funding for foster care and adoption assistance. The Title IV-E program, established in 1980, provides federal funding for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Various acts have amended the program to emphasize children's safety, achieve permanency quickly, and ensure the well-being of children in foster care. The program encompasses three separate programs, each with its own eligibility requirements, but has a single funding authorization in federal law. The Title IV-E program requires states to have a federally approved plan to receive federal funding for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. The plan must include providing foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance agreements, and kinship guardianship assistance agreements for eligible children. States must also perform administrative tasks to ensure the safety, permanence, and well-being of children in foster care. The Title IV-E plan requirements apply to children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship. States must meet these requirements to receive funding for these programs, which define eligible costs and allowable spending. Eligible costs include direct financial assistance and program administration. The Title IV-E plan covers costs for direct financial assistance to eligible children and program administration. Administrative costs include activities like developing case plans, visiting children in care, and finding suitable foster or adoptive homes. Other administrative tasks involve background checks, licensing standards, policy development, and federal compliance reviews. The Title IV-E plan covers direct financial assistance and program administration for eligible children in foster care. Administrative activities include developing case plans, conducting background checks, and ensuring compliance with federal regulations. Eligibility criteria for assistance are based on a child's age, citizenship, and placement in a suitable home. The Title IV-E program provides financial assistance for eligible children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship. States receive reimbursement from the federal government based on their FMAP percentage, which is calculated annually by HHS. The FMAP ranges from 50% to 83%, with higher-income states receiving lower reimbursement rates. For example, a state with an FMAP of 50% would receive 50 cents for every dollar spent on foster care maintenance for eligible children. The federal government reimburses states for various Title IV-E program costs based on their FMAP percentage, which ranges from 50% to 83%. This includes reimbursement for administrative costs, SACWIS development and operation costs, and training costs. During the Great Recession, Congress temporarily increased the federal share of Title IV-E payments to provide state fiscal relief under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) temporarily increased each state's FMAP for the Title IV-E program from October 1, 2008, through June 30, 2011. The federal government obligated $968 million to states under the Title IV-E program as a result of the enhanced FMAP. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E returned to its regular rate after June 30, 2011. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs is authorized on a permanent and open-ended entitlement basis, with no upper or lower limit on annual funding. Congress appropriates funds based on HHS estimates of state spending, referred to as \"definite budget authority.\" Any excess funds lapse and are returned. The federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs is provided based on estimates of state spending, with no set limit on annual funding. If the estimated amount exceeds actual costs, the excess funds are returned, while additional funds are made available if needed. Funding is limited by the amount spent by the state and by eligibility criteria for program costs and recipients. The Title IV-E program provides funding for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance to children who meet federal eligibility criteria. States cannot use Title IV-E funds for children who are not eligible, or for social services, child abuse prevention, investigatory activities, or medical and education expenses. Most Title IV-E funds are used for foster care. The Title IV-E program components include foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Foster care is a temporary living arrangement to ensure a child's safety while the state works on reunification or finding a permanent home through adoption or legal guardianship. The number of children entering foster care annually has decreased to around 250,000 from a peak of 300,000 in the late 1990s to mid-2000s. The total number of children in foster care has declined since FY1999, standing at fewer than 401,000 as of FY2011. The decrease is driven by more children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship and fewer children entering care. Less than half of children in foster care receive federally supported foster care maintenance payments under the Title IV-E program. Federal Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria are multifaceted, reflecting Congress's concern for children's safety and permanency. States can now extend assistance to youth beyond age 18 if reunification or a permanent family is not achieved, based on research showing better outcomes for older youth in foster care. Title IV-E assistance is only available for children removed from very low. Title IV-E foster care assistance can be extended to youth beyond age 18 if reunification or a permanent family is not achieved. This amendment allows states to provide assistance to eligible youth up to age 21, with the condition that the youth must be in school or working. The Title IV-E foster care assistance eligibility criteria stipulate that youth aged 18 or older must be in school, working, engaged in activities to promote employment, or have a documented medical condition. States have the flexibility to choose which criteria to prioritize for eligibility. Most states plan to provide foster care assistance to eligible youth based on education, work, or other criteria. Federal funding for foster care originated in 1961 as part of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Federal foster care eligibility criteria are linked to income standards and other rules established under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Despite the creation of independent funding through the Title IV-E program in 1980, eligibility criteria remain tied to the AFDC program. In FY2011, states claimed $8.327 billion in Title IV-E foster care expenses, with federal reimbursement totaling $4.340 billion. Maintenance payments accounted for 29% of spending, while general foster care administrative expenses made up 46% of the total. In FY2011, Title IV-E foster care spending decreased, with maintenance payments declining steadily since FY1999. The number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments also dropped by almost 45% from FY1998 to FY2011. Total Title IV-E spending for general foster care administrative costs exceeded total Title IV-E spending on foster care maintenance payments since FY2000. Foster care administrative spending increased initially but has trended down since the mid-2000s. Title IV-E foster claims for SACWIS peaked in the late 1990s. Spending on foster care training has not increased despite expanded authority. Title IV-E foster care spending under child welfare demonstration projects surged in FY2007 and FY2008. Title IV-E foster care spending under child welfare demonstration projects increased significantly in FY2007 and FY2008, with most of the spending in FY2011 related to projects in Florida and California. Waiver projects must be cost neutral to the federal government, allowing for a broader range of activities and services to be supported. Authorized Title IV-E spending must be under the state's approved waiver project. Title IV-E spending must be authorized under the state's approved waiver project. Federal support covers 50%\u201383% of foster care maintenance costs based on a state's FMAP. States must provide foster care maintenance payments for all eligible children. There are no federal minimum or maximum payment limits. The law allows states to set foster care maintenance payment rates for eligible children in foster care, with no federal minimum or maximum limits. Rates vary based on the child's age, placement setting, and special needs. In 2008-2009, the average monthly payment for children in non-relative foster homes was $679. Rates may be lower for children with kin and higher for those in group settings. States also differ in how they support foster caregivers with items like clothing and child care. In 2008-2009, foster caregivers received payments covering basic living expenses for children in their care, but many supplemented with their own funds. Non-relative caregivers had higher household incomes compared to formal and informal kin caregivers. The federal government typically covers 54-55% of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, reaching almost 63% in FY2010. The federal share of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments peaked at nearly 63% in FY2010 due to enhanced federal support provided by the ARRA. States had obligated $463 million in additional federal support for foster care maintenance payments under this provision by August 30, 2012, with most of the funds allocated in FY2009 and FY2010. Children in foster care who are not Title IV-E eligible require additional state and local funds to cover their maintenance costs. States can utilize other federal funding streams, such as TANF, to assist these children. TANF \"child-only\" payments can be provided to foster care children ineligible for Title IV-E, living with relatives, regardless of relative's income. States may also use TANF for foster care maintenance payments for other foster care children, funded through prior AFDC Emergency Assistance program. States often use TANF funds for child welfare, but the extent of monthly assistance versus other services is unclear. Other federal funding sources like SSI and Social Security benefits are sometimes used for room and board payments for foster care children meeting eligibility. States may use federal programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security benefits for room and board payments for children in foster care. Medicaid can also supplement payments for children with special medical needs. However, the use of Medicaid for child welfare purposes has decreased. The federal foster care coverage rate has fluctuated over the years, with an estimated 40% of children in foster care receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments in FY2011. The federal foster care coverage rate was estimated at 40% in FY2011, based on administrative data and survey results. The survey reported rates of 68% in FY2000, declining to 58% in FY2006, and 55% in FY2008 and FY2010. Discrepancies between administrative and survey data may be due to differences in counting methods and data quality concerns. The federal foster care coverage rate has shown a decline over the past decade, with discrepancies between administrative and survey data. The static income test for Title IV-E foster care eligibility is a key factor in determining support for children in foster care. States had varying income criteria under the prior AFDC program, impacting eligibility for cash assistance. The income test for Title IV-E foster care eligibility is a significant factor in the decline of federal foster care coverage. State need standards for cash assistance vary, with the median annualized amount for a family of three being $7,740. This amount has decreased from representing 60% of the federal poverty guideline in 1996 to 41% in 2012. In 37 states, children must have monthly income below 50% of the 2012 federal poverty guideline to qualify for federal foster care assistance. The complex eligibility criteria for Title IV-E foster care also include specific court findings, placement in licensed settings, and citizenship requirements. The complex eligibility criteria for Title IV-E foster care, including specific court findings, placement in licensed settings, and citizenship requirements, contribute to the decline in federal foster care coverage. While income is a factor, it is not the sole reason children may be ineligible for support. Research shows that states have various reasons for children being ineligible for Title IV-E foster care, with parent's income being one cited factor. In state FY2010, parent's income was a common reason for children's ineligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments across 26 states. Other factors included lack of required judicial determinations, unlicensed homes, and ineligible placement settings. On average, 10%\u201320% of ineligible cases were linked to these factors, while 17 states cited various \"other\" reasons for ineligibility. In state FY2010, parent's income was a common reason for children's ineligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments across 26 states. On average, 10%\u201320% of ineligible cases were linked to factors such as lack of required judicial determinations, unlicensed homes, and ineligible placement settings. 17 states cited various \"other\" reasons for ineligibility, including child deprivation of parental care or support, removal from specified relative's home, and exceeding specified resource limits. Changes in state policy or practice may address declines in federal foster care coverage rates driven by eligibility criteria other than income. In some states, licensing relatives for foster care may increase Title IV-E ineligibility. States can address this by actively seeking to license relatives and waiving non-safety standards. If children are found ineligible due to missing judicial determinations, states can review procedures and raise awareness with courts. Cooperation between child welfare agencies and courts is crucial for improvement and federal funding for Title IV-E foster care. The share of children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments is crucial for federal funding. States can assign costs to the Title IV-E program for administrative purposes, such as child placement services and program administration. Most administrative spending is tied to caseworker time for child protection activities and background checks for foster parents. In general, states can claim federal Title IV-E support for administrative costs related to operating a foster care program. More than half of the administrative spending in FY2011 was for child-specific case planning and management activities, primarily supporting caseworkers in carrying out case review requirements. A state child welfare agency can receive federal reimbursement for child-specific activities related to foster care, including case planning, court reviews, permanency plans, and transition plans for youth aging out of care. This support is available for children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, even if they are living in the unlicensed home of a relative. The agency can also claim administrative support for these activities while working towards licensing the relative's home. A state child welfare agency can receive federal reimbursement for child-specific activities related to foster care, including case planning, court reviews, permanency plans, and transition plans for youth aging out of care. This support is available for children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, even if they are living in the unlicensed home of a relative. The agency can also claim administrative support for these activities while working towards licensing the relative's home. Additionally, Title IV-E administrative support can be claimed for children at \"imminent risk of removal\" from their home, who are considered \"candidates\" for foster care. This funding covers pre-placement activities such as making referrals for services, participating in court proceedings, and finding a suitable home for the child. The state agency must determine if a child is at \"imminent risk of removal\" and may be a candidate for foster care for up to 6 months without reassessment. The cost for determining Title IV-E foster care eligibility was $184 million in FY2011. States can seek federal support for all costs related to eligibility determinations, including administrative costs for determining eligibility and operating a foster care program. This support can cover licensing requirements, rate setting, background checks, program policies, compliance reviews, and other administrative costs. The state agency must determine if a child is at \"imminent risk of removal\" and may be a candidate for foster care for up to 6 months without reassessment. The cost for determining Title IV-E foster care eligibility was $184 million in FY2011. States can seek federal support for all costs related to eligibility determinations, including administrative costs for operating a foster care program. This support can cover licensing requirements, rate setting, background checks, program policies, compliance reviews, and other administrative costs. Developing required program policies, participating in federal compliance reviews, and other program costs can be supported with Title IV-E dollars, with specific administrative purposes requiring separate cost allocation processes. The apparent increase in Title IV-E foster care administrative costs for FY2011 may reflect changes in state spending patterns or reporting methods due to the new form required for submitting spending claims to HHS. In FY2011, new categories for Title IV-E foster care administrative costs were added, including \"provider management\" and \"agency management.\" States reported provider management costs of $298 million and agency management costs of $708 million. These costs were combined as \"other\" administrative costs for that year. The new reporting form and renaming of spending categories likely influenced how states reported their administrative spending. Comparisons across years may be affected by these changes. In FY2000, spending on Title IV-E foster care administrative purposes exceeded spending on foster care maintenance payments. Despite a decrease in caseload, administrative spending continued to rise for several years. By FY2006, administrative costs made up 55% of all Title IV-E foster care spending, compared to 35% for maintenance payments. Although the share of administrative spending has decreased since then, in FY2011 it still accounted for 46% of program costs, higher than maintenance payments at 29%. Since the late 1990s, Title IV-E foster care administrative costs have been a concern for policymakers, representing a larger share of program costs (46%) than foster care maintenance payments (29%). State compliance with new plan requirements has led to increased spending on administrative purposes, aimed at improving outcomes for children and families in the child welfare system. Examples of requirements include timely permanency hearings and background checks for foster and adoptive parents. Children in foster care are not being reunited with their parents. Background checks are conducted for prospective foster and adoptive parents, including FBI fingerprint checks and checks of state child abuse registries. Plans are made for the educational stability of children in foster care and for youth aging out of the system. Relatives are identified and notified when a child enters foster care. Credit reports of older children in care are checked annually. Federal conformity reviews have increased administrative costs for Title IV-E compliance. Increased Title IV-E administrative costs for case planning, review, pre-placement, and provider management have driven up expenses in the child welfare system. All children in foster care, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility, must receive case planning and review services. States can supplement funding for these services with other federal funds like Title IV-B, SSBG, and TANF. Some states have used Medicaid for case planning activities for non-Title IV-E eligible children, but there has been a decline in state child welfare agency spending of Medicaid funds. Title IV-E training support is available for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship programs. The data shows a decline in state child welfare agency spending of Medicaid funds. Title IV-E training support is available for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship programs. The total amount of Title IV-E program dollars spent for training purposes has decreased in most years since FY2000. Federal reimbursement for training costs is generally 75% for all states. Training under the Title IV-E program is mainly related to foster care but includes adoption assistance and kinship guardianship. Federal reimbursement is limited to costs incurred by the state for training individuals providing care to Title IV-E eligible children. States may seek partial federal reimbursement for short-term training costs. States can seek federal reimbursement for short-term training related to Title IV-E programs, covering topics like administrative tasks and social work practices. However, the training cannot include providing mental health or substance abuse treatment, conducting child abuse investigations, or treating caregiver issues. The focus is on training individuals caring for Title IV-E eligible children. The Title IV-E program allows states to seek federal reimbursement for short-term training related to child welfare, excluding mental health or substance abuse treatment and caregiver issues. Long-term training can also be supported for individuals in public child welfare agencies or preparing for such employment, with a 75% reimbursement rate as of FY2013. The 2008 act authorized Title IV-E training claims for private, licensed child welfare agencies, prospective relative guardians, and individuals handling child abuse and neglect cases in court. Reimbursement rates started at 55% in FY2009 and increased by five percentage points annually until reaching 75% in FY2013. Most training claims are still submitted under pre-existing provisions, with a decline in spending over the last decade due to fewer children being eligible for Title IV-E assistance. The limited spending by states on training for individuals caring for children eligible for Title IV-E assistance may reflect the discretion states have over training dollars. The Title IV-E plan requires states to adequately prepare foster parents with knowledge and skills but is mostly silent on training. Unlike the immediate need for caseworkers, the need to train staff may seem less urgent. States have the option to claim federal reimbursement under the Title IV-E program for 50% of the cost to operate a Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). Most SACWIS costs are related to foster care programs, adoption assistance, or kinship guardianship assistance. As of September 2012, 36 states have an operational SACWIS, while three are in the development phase. Choosing to have a SACWIS allows states to seek federal reimbursement for costs that would otherwise not be allowed. As of September 2012, 36 states have operational SACWIS, three are developing SACWIS, and 13 states have a non-SACWIS model information system. Congress stipulated that SACWIS systems must comply with HHS regulations, interface with state child abuse and neglect data systems, and provide efficient administration of child welfare programs. States are required to develop comprehensive child welfare data collection systems under the SACWIS rule, with enhanced federal reimbursement rates available for development costs. Since FY1994, federal reimbursement for SACWIS development and operation costs has been available at a 50% rate. States can claim Title IV-E reimbursement for approved systems regardless of the children served. States have invested $4.7 billion in SACWIS costs, with the federal government reimbursing over half ($2.6 billion). The federal government has reimbursed over half ($2.6 billion or 55%) of the $4.7 billion states invested in SACWIS costs. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 established federal support for children with special needs in foster care. The 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act aimed to increase the number of children placed in permanent homes through adoption assistance. By FY1997, 146,900 children were receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 further accelerated the process of finding permanent adoptive homes for children in foster care. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 required states to ensure the availability of children for adoption if they had been in care for a certain time or if efforts to reunite them with parents were not required. It also authorized Adoption Incentives to reward states for increasing adoptions from foster care. This led to a significant increase in adoptions, with over 50,000 adoptions annually from FY2000 to FY2011. The average time a child spent in foster care before adoption decreased from 46 months in FY2000 to 34 months in FY2011. The number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance increased significantly from FY1997 to FY2010, reaching 423,200 by FY2010. However, there was a slight decline in the caseload for FY2011, with an estimated 413,800 children receiving assistance. This decline may be due to children aging out of the system or changes in federal eligibility criteria. The decline in the number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance from FY2010 to FY2011 may be related to federal eligibility criteria changes and data quality concerns. The caseload decreased to an estimated 413,800 children receiving assistance in FY2011. Federal adoption assistance under Title IV-E provides reimbursement to states for adoption assistance payments for eligible adopted children with special needs. States must meet requirements for foster care funding, have an approved plan, and enter into an adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents. Payments for non-recurring adoption expenses and ongoing monthly subsidies may be provided. Eligibility criteria include income and resource limits linked to prior federal cash aid programs. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) introduces new federal adoption assistance eligibility rules that remove income and resource tests linked to prior federal cash aid programs. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E adoption assistance costs covers various expenses at reimbursement rates ranging from 50% to 83%. Program administration costs, including non-recurring adoption expenses and training costs, are also reimbursed. States with an approved Title IV-E plan can submit adoption assistance claims to HHS for reimbursement of eligible costs incurred. In FY2011, states received federal reimbursement of 57.8% of the $4.009 billion in adoption assistance expenses. The program cost is mainly tied to ongoing assistance payments, reimbursed at a higher rate than other adoption assistance claims. Administrative spending is reimbursed at 50% in all states. The federal reimbursement rate for Title IV-E adoption assistance claims is higher than for other claims, typically between 54.0% and 54.5%. Administrative spending is reimbursed at 50% in all states. The federal share of funding for Title IV-E adoption assistance has reached up to 60% in some years. The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding reached 60% in FY2009 and FY2010, close to 58% in FY2011, due to temporary enhanced federal support from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. States had obligated over $502 million in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance spending by August 2012, with most in FY2009 and FY2010. Spending rose rapidly between FY1997 and FY2002, slowed through FY2010, and declined in FY2011, coinciding with a decrease in adoption assistance caseload. It is unclear if the lower spending is a trend or anomaly. The HHS projected continued growth in Title IV-E adoption assistance caseload and federal outlays through FY2017. Eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance requires a child to be determined as having \"special needs\" and meet specific federal eligibility criteria. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 outlines additional requirements for receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance payments. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) removes income or resource-related tests from federal eligibility pathways for applicable children. The most common Title IV-E adoption assistance pathway requires a child to have been removed from their home due to welfare concerns. Under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, applicable children can qualify for Title IV-E adoption assistance through various pathways. One pathway involves meeting the criteria of the AFDC program as of July 16, 1996. Another pathway is for special needs children who meet the requirements of the SSI program. A third pathway is for special needs children living with their minor parent receiving foster care maintenance payments. Special needs children deemed applicable can qualify without the need for additional SSI program criteria. Under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, special needs children can qualify for Title IV-E adoption assistance through various pathways. This includes children who were receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance payments in a dissolved adoption or if the adoptive parents die. The pathway is also available for children who would have been eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance in a previous adoption. Additionally, states are required to reinvest any savings from expanded federal support into child welfare-related services. Congress required states to reinvest state savings from expanded federal support into child welfare-related services, including post adoption services. States must provide assurance and document how these funds are spent, as mandated by the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act. Eligibility changes under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 aim to expand Title IV-E adoption assistance to most special needs children, with some exceptions due to federal eligibility criteria. States were required to submit revised assurances to HHS by January 31, 2012. The federal eligibility criteria for Title IV-E adoption assistance include completion of an adoption assistance agreement, background checks for prospective adoptive parents, and age/citizenship requirements for the child. Eligibility pathways and special needs criteria must be met for ongoing assistance payments. The federal eligibility criteria for Title IV-E adoption assistance require a child to meet special needs criteria and one of four eligibility pathways. The state must determine that the child cannot be returned to their parents and that there is a specific factor making it unlikely for the child to be adopted without assistance. Additionally, reasonable efforts to place the child must have been made without success. States establish conditions for special needs adoption assistance, which must be honored once defined. Sibling group membership is considered a special need factor in every state, with variations in requirements based on group size. States establish conditions for special needs adoption assistance, with variations in requirements based on sibling group size. Some states require additional findings for sibling groups of two, while others allow special needs for groups of three or more. Criteria may include age or specific needs. Placement together or at different times may be permitted, with additional conditions for later placements. Age is commonly used as a special needs factor. States establish conditions for special needs adoption assistance, with variations in requirements based on sibling group size. Age is commonly used as a special needs factor, with states setting minimum ages ranging from one to 12 years. Some states also consider a child's membership in a minority group or race as a factor in establishing special needs. Almost half of all states consider a child's minority group or race as a factor in determining special needs status, along with medical, physical, emotional, or behavioral factors. States require documentation by a qualified professional, with some specifying conditions as \"severe\" or \"severe or moderate\" and requiring ongoing rehabilitation or treatment. Two-thirds of states also include \"high risk\" factors, indicating a likelihood of developing medical conditions or disabilities based on prior experiences or characteristics. States have various criteria for determining special needs status in adopted children, including genetic predisposition to mental illness, prenatal exposure to toxins, and history of abuse or neglect. Adoption assistance payments may be contingent on the child showing symptoms of the condition. Other factors considered include length of time available for adoption, disrupted adoptions, multiple placements, language barriers, adoption by relatives, emotional ties with foster parents, and documented history of abuse or neglect. The share of adopted children with special needs fluctuated between 84% and 88% from FY2000-FY2011, with no clear trend. Factors for special needs include sibling group membership, medical conditions, and disabilities. Age is less important now, while sibling group and other reasons have become more significant. Racial/ethnic background is the least common factor. States must have an adoption assistance agreement for children with special needs. An adoption assistance agreement must be made between adoptive parents, the state Title IV-E agency, and relevant agencies for children with special needs. The agreement specifies payments, services, and assistance, and remains valid regardless of the parents' state of residence. Children eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance also qualify for Medicaid. The agreement is binding and can only be terminated if the child reaches the age limit for assistance or if the state determines the parents are no longer legally responsible. The adoption assistance agreement is valid for children with special needs, lasting until the child is between 18 and 21 years old. Parents are no longer responsible if their rights are terminated, the child marries, enlists in the military, or becomes emancipated. Support from parents can include payments for various needs. The majority of children adopted from foster care have an adoption assistance agreement, with most receiving an ongoing subsidy and Medicaid. About 19% of these children have used mental health care services. Among children adopted from foster care with adoption assistance agreements, a significant portion have utilized mental health care services, tutoring services, and some have received residential treatment. States provide federally subsidized monthly adoption assistance payments based on the child's needs and the adoptive parents' circumstances. Adoption assistance payments are based on the child's needs and adoptive parents' circumstances. Payments can be adjusted with parental agreement but cannot exceed what the child would receive in foster care. There are no restrictions on how the money is spent. Rates vary by state, with specialized rates for children with extraordinary needs. The 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents found that a significant number of children adopted from foster care receive monthly subsidies, with varying amounts based on the child's needs. While most parents felt the payment amount met their child's needs, not all families of adopted Title IV-E-eligible children with special needs receive ongoing adoption assistance payments. Federal support for finalizing adoption may not be needed if parents' circumstances allow, but having an adoption assistance agreement in place ensures eligibility for Medicaid and allows for payments to be established later if needed. State spending on Title IV-E adoption assistance payments is shown in Table 8, with support for special needs adoptees not meeting federal criteria coming from non-Title IV-E sources. Data on the total number of special needs adoptees receiving assistance is not reliably available. The median Title IV-E adoption assistance coverage rate reported was 76%, with most states reporting rates of 71% or higher. Non-recurring adoption expenses include legal fees and court costs related to the adoption of a child with special needs. States are required to provide reimbursement for these expenses under Title IV-E. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended Title IV-E to require states to provide reimbursement for \"non-recurring adoption expenses\" for adoptive parents of children with special needs. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 stipulates that a child adopted from outside the United States is not eligible for federal adoption assistance. States can claim federal reimbursement for 50% of the expenses. States can claim federal reimbursement for 50% of non-recurring adoption expenses provided to adoptive parents of children with special needs, up to a maximum of $2,000 per child. Roughly half of the states reimburse costs up to $2,000, while others limit reimbursement to smaller amounts. The federal adoption tax credit also provides support for non-recurring adoption expenses for families adopting special needs children. In FY2011, states reported spending $37.7 million on non-recurring adoption expenses, with federal reimbursement covering half of that amount. The percentage of children adopted with public agency involvement receiving monthly subsidies has remained stable, but the share supported by federal Title IV-E dollars has declined from 75% in FY2000 to 66% in FY2011. The percentage of children adopted with public agency involvement receiving monthly subsidies has remained stable, but the share supported by federal Title IV-E dollars has declined from 75% in FY2000 to 66% in FY2011. Adoption assistance payments are generally provided to children who meet special needs criteria, and the federal government is committed to supporting nearly all special needs adoptees as of FY2018. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathway linked to the eligibility criteria of the prior law AFDC program is the most frequently used. In FY2011, new eligibility rules removed the AFDC income standard from Title IV-E adoption assistance, benefiting children aged 14 or older. However, the AFDC income criteria still applied to the majority of children receiving adoption assistance. The median age of children adopted from foster care remained above five. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with relatives. This assistance followed years of state experimentation with subsidized guardianship programs. The Government Accountability Office recommended federal support for guardianship to reduce African American children in foster care. States can choose to provide kinship guardianship assistance under Title IV-E, with 31 states amending their plans for federal reimbursement. Virginia's plan is still under review. The federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance is available for eligible children in 31 states, with Virginia's plan still under review. States can seek reimbursement for expenses incurred up to two years after the effective date of their plan amendment. Additionally, states that previously operated a subsidized guardianship assistance program can receive federal reimbursement for services provided to children under that program. States can seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of eligible children at the state's FMAP rate. Administrative costs for the program may also be reimbursed at 50%. The requirements for case planning and review no longer apply once a child is no longer in foster care. States are required to provide funds to relative guardians for non-recurring costs of legal guardianship. They can claim federal reimbursement for 50% of the assistance cost. States can also seek reimbursement for training related to Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance, with a federal reimbursement rate of 75%. Table 12 shows eligible spending and federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance. The average monthly number of children assisted is also reported, although data for FY2011 is incomplete. HHS estimates federal outlays for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance to increase to $81 million for FY2013 and $174 million by FY2017, assisting 14,000 and 28,000 children monthly, respectively. Title IV-E agencies must detail efforts to determine permanency options for children in foster care, including discussions with relative foster parents about adoption. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility requirements for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, including the need for a kinship guardianship assistance agreement between the state agency and the relative guardian. It also mentions the case plan requirement for children in foster care and the lack of this requirement once a child leaves foster care permanently. The eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments requires a kinship guardianship assistance agreement with the relative guardian, the child's eligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, and state determinations on kinship guardianship as a permanency goal. Eligibility is linked to the child's previous eligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for at least six consecutive months. The eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments requires a voluntary placement agreement or a judge's determination that living at home is not in the child's welfare. The family's income must meet AFDC standards, and the relative guardian must meet foster care licensing and background check requirements. States must conduct specific background checks before a relative guardian can be approved. Relative guardians must undergo fingerprint-based checks of national crime databases and child abuse registries before receiving kinship guardianship assistance payments for an eligible child. If a state has a valid background check for a foster parent seeking to become a relative guardian, it does not need to redo the check. To be eligible for assistance payments, the individual must have been the child's foster parent for at least six months, meet licensing requirements, and have no prohibited felony convictions. The legal guardian must be a grandparent or relative with a strong commitment to caring for the child permanently. To be eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, the legal guardian must be a grandparent or relative with a strong commitment to permanently care for the child. States can define \"relative\" broadly to include tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other fictive kin. The child must not be suitable for reunification with parents or adoption, show a strong attachment to the prospective guardian, and if 14 or older, be consulted about the guardianship arrangement. To be eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance, the child must be age 14 or older and consulted about the arrangement. Assistance can continue until age 18, or up to 21 for those with disabilities or in specific circumstances. States can extend assistance up to age 19, 20, or 21 for students, employed individuals, or those with barriers to employment. Assistance must also be provided to eligible youth in kinship guardianship arrangements if the state extends assistance to youth in foster care after age 18. Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance can be provided to eligible youth in a kinship guardianship arrangement if they entered after age 16 and meet all requirements. States have the option to extend assistance to siblings of eligible children placed with the same relative guardian. Additional conditions can be set by states, but must be approved by HHS. States can impose conditions for kinship guardianship assistance beyond federal law, such as requiring a child to have lived with the relative guardian for more than 6 months, specifying a minimum age requirement, and mandating cooperation with child support enforcement. Reimbursement for assistance payments requires a written agreement with the relative guardian, detailing payment terms and remaining in effect regardless of the guardian's location. The kinship guardianship assistance agreement specifies payment terms, additional services, and non-recurring expenses. It remains in effect as long as the child meets eligibility criteria and the relative guardian provides support. Payment amount is capped at the foster care maintenance payment level. The kinship guardianship assistance payment is capped at the foster care maintenance payment level. The law ensures that children eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance remain eligible for Medicaid. Tribes can receive federal support for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship under the Title IV-E program. The Port Gamble S'Klallam tribe became the first tribe to independently operate a Title IV-E program in 2012. Other tribes are working towards approval for their own programs. States and tribes can enter agreements for Title IV-E funds to support children in tribal custody. The federal reimbursement rate for children under tribal authority is based on the tribal FMAP. The Appendix provides an overview of tribal receipt of direct federal funding under the Title IV-E program. Requirements for direct Title IV-E funding to tribes are similar to those for states, with modifications for tribes such as defining service areas in the plan and demonstrating compliance with audit requirements. The law requires evidence of no significant audit exceptions under federal grants related to social services for tribal Title IV-E plan approval. Tribal authority must license foster homes, and eligibility for tribal children is similar to state programs. AFDC rules from the state where the child lived when removed apply for Title IV-E eligibility. Tribal licensing standards apply for approving foster homes and child care institutions. Under a tribal Title IV-E plan, background checks for prospective foster or adoptive parents must meet federal requirements. Tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding must have an approved plan that aligns with federal regulations and have processes in place for claiming federal reimbursement. They must also report data to HHS regarding children in tribal foster care. Eligibility for Title IV-E assistance, cost allocation methodologies, and reporting data to HHS Children's Bureau are essential for tribes in foster care custody. Federal reimbursement for tribal Title IV-E program costs includes unique FMAP rates based on per capita income, with training costs reimbursed at 75% and other program costs at 50% of eligible spending. Costs for administering the Title IV-E program for tribes are covered at 50% of eligible spending. Tribes can seek federal reimbursement for costs related to eligible children, but must accurately determine Title IV-E eligibility. A valid cost allocation methodology is required for training and administrative claims, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs overseeing tribal cost allocation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs oversees tribal cost allocation for the Title IV-E program. Tribes can use federal funds from specific programs as non-federal dollars for Title IV-E spending. In-kind third party expenditures can be used for the non-federal share of administrative and training costs. Tribes can use in-kind expenditures to cover the full non-federal share of Title IV-E administrative and training costs starting from FY2012. Tribes operating a Title IV-E program must collect and report data to HHS. Tribes operating a Title IV-E program must collect and report data to the HHS Children's Bureau regarding children in foster care or those adopted under the public child welfare agency. Data must be submitted electronically as part of the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) in a format prescribed by federal regulations. Tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding must have a statewide information system capable of tracking each child in foster care. Tribes seeking Title IV-E funding must have a system to track children in foster care. They may develop a Tribal Automated Child Welfare Information System (TACWIS) to share data and make federal reimbursement claims. States report additional child welfare data through NCANDS and NYTD. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) outlines federal rules for transferring child custody proceedings from state to tribal courts. Title IV-E funding for tribes does not require reporting data through NCANDS or NYTD. The Fostering Connections Act mandates HHS to regulate transferring care responsibilities from state to tribal child welfare agencies for continued eligibility. The regulations for transferring child custody from state to tribal child welfare agencies were issued by HHS in 2012. States must establish transfer procedures in consultation with tribes, ensuring eligibility for Title IV-E assistance and Medicaid continues. Essential documentation includes judicial determinations and efforts to reunite the child with their family. The process of preparing and gaining approval for a Title IV-E plan involves significant planning and documentation. Tribal entities can receive up to $300,000 in one-time grants to help develop and submit their Title IV-E plan to HHS within 24 months. Repayment of the grant is required if certain conditions are not met. The Title IV-E plan development process for tribal entities involves significant planning and documentation. Tribes can receive up to $300,000 in one-time grants to support plan development. Repayment of the grant is required if the plan is not submitted to HHS within 24 months, with the possibility of waiver under certain circumstances. HHS awarded tribal implementation grants to 12 tribes for Title IV-E plan approval. Tribes are finalizing their plans with technical assistance provided by HHS for child welfare programs. Technical assistance is available to tribes for operating Title IV-E or Title IV-B programs and for entering into tribal-state agreements. HHS awarded funding to the Tribal Law and Policy Institute for a National Resource Center for Tribes, expected to last up to five years. For more information, visit http://www.NRC4tribes.org."
