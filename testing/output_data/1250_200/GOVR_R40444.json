    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. CHIPRA allows states to expand eligibility for children under 19, but reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children. The federal matching rate (FMAP) is used for CHIP enrollees with family income over 300% of poverty, excluding a block of income not determined by expense or income type. States can assist qualifying children through Medicaid or separate CHIP programs. Medicaid follows Medicaid rules, while separate CHIP programs follow Title XXI rules with federal CHIP funds covering program costs. Title XXI does not guarantee individual benefits but entitles states with approved plans. Title XXI entitles states with approved CHIP plans to federal funds based on a distribution formula. Low-income children covered under CHIP-funded Medicaid expansions are entitled to benefits under Medicaid law. States can cover these children by expanding Medicaid eligibility groups or liberalizing financial rules. Many states opt to cover low-income children under existing Medicaid pathways to reduce administrative burden. States can determine eligibility for targeted low-income children in separate CHIP programs based on factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Before CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers or by providing health benefits coverage for unborn children. States have the option to extend coverage to pregnant women through CHIP programs, including prenatal care and delivery services. In October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with some using waivers or state plan amendments. In FY2008, there were 364,161 unborn children enrolled in CHIP, with California having the highest enrollment. Tennessee was the only state that did not extend coverage to unborn children of undocumented aliens. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment. States must meet certain conditions, such as ensuring the Medicaid income standard for pregnant women is at least 185% FPL. Pregnant women can be enrolled for prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with benefits similar to those available to CHIP children. States can also provide presumptive eligibility for up to two months. Benefits for pregnant women under CHIP include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one, with eligibility redetermined at that point. States can cover pregnant women through waivers and offer postpartum services. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP for five years, but coverage was permitted at state option after that period. Sponsor's income and resources are considered for legal immigrants, and the sponsor must ensure the immigrant's financial support for federally means-tested programs. The affidavit of support required sponsors to ensure new immigrants do not become a public charge and are financially responsible. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. States could provide coverage without it being deemed against the sponsor's affidavit of support. Eligibility redetermination processes were required at least every 12 months for individuals eligible under this provision. Under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to modify aspects of CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. Some states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, which are subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for states with adult coverage have not been approved since 2007 in some cases. States have faced federal CHIP shortfalls, with waiver renewals not approved in some cases since 2007. CHIPRA terminates coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage for childless adults. Budget neutrality standards are required for succeeding fiscal years. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers, with spending tied to waiver spending in preceding fiscal years. Allowable spending under waivers for parents will change in FY2012. Under CHIPRA, states with CHIP parent coverage waivers can cover parents, but starting in FY2012, spending will be subject to a set-aside amount and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP. States must meet coverage benchmarks to receive enhanced FMAP for parents. CHIPRA also includes provisions for access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, with $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants authorized. CHIPRA allocates funds for outreach campaigns from 2009 to 2013, with 10% for a national enrollment campaign and 10% for Native American children. The remaining 80% goes to state, local governments, and community organizations for outreach in rural and underserved areas. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA also requires states to reduce administrative barriers to enrollment for children and pregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, states have the option to use findings from \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for children under 19. Under CHIPRA, states have the option to use Express Lane eligibility determination for children under 19, allowing automatic enrollment with family consent. The provision also allows states to rely on reported income from state tax records for Medicaid or CHIP eligibility. CHIPRA eliminates the requirement for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP applications. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants claiming to be citizens. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) mandated proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. CHIPRA introduced an alternative using Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for verification. States can now require citizenship documentation for CHIP. Some states have CHIP coverage above 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In California, children up to age two have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL. 11 states have income thresholds between 200% and 250% FPL, while 22 states set upper income limits at 200% FPL. CHIP enrollment in FY2008 was nearly 7.4 million children, with 5.3 million covered in state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adults, with 12 states reporting enrollment of about 335,000 adults in FY2008. This number is lower than in previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. In FY2008, adult CHIP enrollment decreased due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota had more adult enrollees than children. States can cover low-income children under Medicaid or CHIP programs. States using Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must offer mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions with new benefit plans. Benchmark-equivalent benefit plans are offered through separate CHIP programs for children under age 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups. The EPSDT Program provides well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical care. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or another approved health benefits plan. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for uninsured children must include a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages. It should cover basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab services, and well-child care, including immunizations. Additionally, it must provide at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for additional services. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for additional services like prescription drugs, vision services, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. CHIP programs are present in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories, with different approaches used for coverage. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse services coverage under CHIP. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) ensures mental health parity by requiring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance abuse benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration, and emergency treatment. The new law requires dental services for children under CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration, and emergency treatment. States can offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages, and parents of newborns will receive dental education. Detailed information on children receiving dental care must be reported, and a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by the GAO. The report includes recommendations for federal and state actions to address barriers to dental care and the use of mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed funds to be used for children in employer-sponsored coverage, with a state option for dental-only supplemental coverage. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP. The state must meet specific eligibility criteria to provide dental coverage under CHIP, including not limiting applications or imposing enrollment caps. States cannot offer better dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage than for those eligible for full CHIP benefits. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only coverage. Under prior law, states could pay for employer-based health insurance if cost-effective and not a substitute for CHIP coverage. States using CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums must ensure CHIP minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period for children without group coverage. Medicaid allows premium assistance if the employer plan is cost-effective. States must provide \"wrap-around\" coverage for services not included in private plans, which can be challenging for many employer plans and states. States using CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums must ensure CHIP minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period for children without group coverage. To overcome restrictions, most states operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs under waivers. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance and required states to include outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. Premium assistance may be offered for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, under certain conditions. Under CHIPRA, states offering premium assistance for CHIP eligible individuals can choose regular CHIP over employer plans. The subsidy covers the difference in premiums for child coverage. A wrap-around is required for employer plans not meeting CHIP benefits. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for private coverage with premium assistance. CHIPRA allows the subsidy to cover family premiums if cheaper than individual CHIP coverage. States and employers must conduct outreach for premium assistance programs. Under CHIPRA, states can establish employer-family premium assistance pools for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees. The law also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a qualifying event for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, and copayments. Cost-sharing in health insurance plans includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States have the option to impose cost-sharing for certain beneficiaries and services under CHIP. Medicaid rules apply nominal cost-sharing for low-income children, with exemptions for most. Children in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may face service-related cost-sharing. DRA allows states to apply premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs based on family income levels. Cost-sharing under CHIP may be imposed for certain beneficiaries, with limits on service-related cost-sharing based on family income levels. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. States can condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments. Providers may deny care for failure to pay cost-sharing. Separate state CHIP programs may impose premiums based on family income. Fees for program participation in CHIP are income-dependent, with limits on cost-sharing. Families under 150% FPL have capped premiums as per federal regulations. Cost-sharing for lower-income families is nominal, while slightly higher for those between 100%-150% FPL. Higher-income families can be charged any amount, with a 5% out-of-pocket limit. States must inform families of limits and offer a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines preventive services exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families, including newborn visits, physical exams, immunizations, dental services, and data collection improvements under CHIPRA 2009. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) added reporting requirements to states' annual CHIP reports, established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), and mandated a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans. This evaluation will focus on access to primary and specialty care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. The federal evaluation of CHIP coverage will assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention issues. Federal financing for CHIP includes appropriations for states' allotments, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and administrative expense caps. BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007, with varying funding levels each year. The federal evaluation of CHIP coverage includes assessing outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention issues. Funding for CHIP fluctuated over the years, with appropriations ranging from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion. The 110th Congress attempted to reauthorize CHIP with bills H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963, but both were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided funds for CHIP allotments until March 31, 2009. CHIPRA allocated $68.9 billion for CHIP from FY2009 to FY2013. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law, based on survey estimates of low-income children and uninsured children. The territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder divided among the states. The CHIP allotments for states are calculated based on a formula set in law, ensuring that each state's allotment does not exceed the national appropriation. These allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with FY2009 and onwards allotments only available for two years. States can draw from different allotments based on their federal CHIP spending and projections for the fiscal year. The state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment is determined by a formula involving federal CHIP spending, growth factors, and state projections. The allotment for FY2010 includes various components like unspent funds from previous years and Contingency Fund payments. For FY2011 and FY2013, allotments are \"rebased\" based on prior year spending and a new base. In FY2011 and FY2013, state allotments are \"rebased\" using prior year spending. The allotment for FY2012 is calculated based on the previous year's allotment and Contingency Fund spending, multiplied by the state's growth factor. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. BBA 97 stipulated rules for redistribution, with the Secretary determining how funds are allocated. In FY2006, additional funds were appropriated to cover shortfalls in 12 states, with Illinois and Massachusetts experiencing higher CHIP spending than anticipated. In FY2006, Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than expected, resulting in shortfalls of around $100 million, mostly from Illinois. A bill was passed in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to redistribute $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 specified that funds would go to states facing monthly funding shortfalls in FY2007 to delay shortfalls until March 2007. Additionally, up to half of unspent FY2005 allotments could be redistributed to further delay shortfalls. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 redistributed unspent FY2004 allotments to states facing funding shortfalls in FY2007. The act also allowed for the redistribution of unspent FY2005 allotments to delay shortfalls further. In FY2008, MMSEA required monthly redistribution of unspent FY2005 allotments to shortfall states in order of experiencing shortfalls. Additionally, P.L. 110-28 appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls of federal CHIP funds in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments to shortfall states on a monthly basis. Up to $1.6 billion was appropriated for states' remaining shortfalls, but only just under $1 billion was provided. For FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were redistributed to states facing shortfalls before March 31, 2009. MMSEA also allocated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments from CHIPRA should prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. Additionally, a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created under CHIPRA to prevent states from experiencing funding shortfalls. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created under CHIPRA to prevent states from federal funding shortfalls. It receives a separate appropriation and can make direct payments to states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. Payments cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment amount and are subject to proportional reduction if necessary. CHIP is a federal-state matching program with an enhanced FMAP, making a state's share of expenditures 30% lower than under the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. There is a 10% cap on federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses, including data collection and outreach. Under CHIPRA, states can receive federal CHIP bonus payments by increasing Medicaid child enrollment and implementing specific outreach activities. The funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment amounts."
