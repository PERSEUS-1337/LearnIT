    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition, caregiver support, employment, long-term care, and abuse prevention. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Funding for different titles comes from HHS or the Department of Labor. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times. OAA Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times since its enactment. The last reauthorization occurred in 2006, authorizing appropriations through FY2011. Despite the expiration of authorizations, funding for OAA programs has continued. This report discusses OAA funding, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding for programs, funding history since FY2001, legislative activity in FY2015, and funding decisions for selected programs. Appendixes provide more detailed funding information and history. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of the funding. In FY2015, OAA funding was allocated to various programs, with Title V receiving the largest share at 23.1%. Funding for most programs remained the same as in FY2014, except for Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities under Title IV, which received new funding for specific initiatives. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs has seen slight increases over the years, with annual increases from FY2006 to FY2010. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, then saw annual increases from FY2006 to FY2010. Funding levels have since remained below FY2010 levels, with some fluctuations in FY2011 through FY2015. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, combining aging and disability services programs. Prior to this, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. The FY2015 appropriations law (P.L. 113-235) signed by President Obama on December 16, 2014, provided $1.878 billion in funding for OAA programs. Prior to this, three continuing resolutions were passed to fund discretionary Labor-HHS-Education programs. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for a FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, but a bill introduced would have increased funding for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and Title III senior nutrition programs. The FY2015 appropriations law provided $1.878 billion in funding for OAA programs, with increases for Title V (CSEOA) and Title III senior nutrition programs. The bill proposed funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, with specific increases for family caregiver funding and decreases for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with funding levels mostly maintained from FY2014 except for specific increases and decreases. This included $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" authorized under OAA Sections 451 and 751 and the Elder Justice Act. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. Variations in funding for selected OAA programs and issues were highlighted among different budget proposals and final funding enacted under P.L. 113-235. This includes funding for CSEOA, Holocaust survivors' support, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. The CSEOA program aims to provide part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, citing benefits of integration with other aging services programs. The proposed funding for FY2015 was $380.0 million, 13% less than FY2014. Of the 56 state and territorial grantees, 17 are in state labor departments. ACL shared CSEOA's mission of helping older Americans maintain independence. Congressional legislation would be required for the transfer to take effect. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, requiring congressional legislation for the transfer to take effect. ACL would target the program to those with the greatest need and consider all sources of income for eligibility. ACL also proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program, separate from Workforce Investment Act programs. The Senate bill would have funded CSEOA at the FY2014 level, with the subcommittee recommending keeping CSEOA in DOL. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, targeting those with the greatest need. The Senate bill recommended funding CSEOA at the FY2014 level under DOL. Final FY2015 funding made no changes to CSEOA administration, remaining funded and administered under DOL with the same appropriations as FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed establishing a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund with $5.0 million in OAA Title IV funding. The Senate bill did not propose funding for the Fund due to budget constraints. The Senate bill did not propose funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding to provide supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) aim to provide information and access to long-term services and supports for consumers, with over 500 sites nationwide. ADRCs help individuals stay in their homes after hospitalization or rehabilitation. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide, with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. Funding for ADRCs includes $10 million in mandatory funding from the ACA and $6.1 million in discretionary funding under OAA Title II in FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding but $20.0 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. Additional funding could help ADRC programs meet Medicaid requirements. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs under the Medicaid Balancing Incentive Payments Program. The final FY2015-enacted funding also provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to ADRCs, the same as the FY2014 amount. The White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused national attention on concerns of older individuals and provided direction to federal policymakers. The first White House Conference on Aging was held in 1961, with subsequent conferences in 1971, 1981, 1995, and 2005. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a conference in 2015, but no dedicated funding was provided in the final FY2015 appropriations. The White House plans to hold the conference in 2015 in Washington, DC, using technology to engage more people. The White House Conference on Aging will commemorate the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act. Policy areas include retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will gather input for the conference.
