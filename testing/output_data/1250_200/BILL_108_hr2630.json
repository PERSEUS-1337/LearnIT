The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to limit the number of nonimmigrant visas for aliens with critical information on alien smuggling organizations to 400 per fiscal year. If the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, or the Attorney General determines the identity of an individual is essential to an authorized criminal investigation, they may be admitted as a nonimmigrant.

The program is administered by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. The rewards program targets individuals involved in commercial alien smuggling, including those endangering lives or posing health risks by transporting groups of 10 or more aliens. Rewards are given for arrests, convictions, prevention of smuggling acts, dismantling of smuggling organizations, and identifying key leaders in smuggling operations.
