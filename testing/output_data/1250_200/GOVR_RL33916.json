    "content": "The 2002 farm bill expanded commodity support to include additional commodities like dry peas, lentils, and wool. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays for commodity support using a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Expenditures for commodity support have averaged $12.6 billion per year, but are projected to decrease to $7 billion per year due to high market prices. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.494 billion from the current services baseline for commodity support. The USDA's proposed modifications to current law aim to save $4.494 billion from commodity support programs. The changes are designed to make the programs more market-oriented, predictable, and less distorting in the World Trade Organization. The proposal includes setting crop loan rates based on market prices to minimize distortions and encourage farmers to plant crops accordingly. Loan rates for each commodity would be set at 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices or the loan rates, whichever is lower. The Administration's proposal aims to save $4.5 billion over 10 years by setting crop loan rates based on market prices. The rates would be the lesser of 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices or the loan rates specified in the 2002 farm bill. Questions raised include the impact on federal outlays over the past five years, which commodities have had prices below the proposed levels, and the potential decrease in savings if current law loan rates were used instead. Additionally, the idea of replacing nonrecourse loans with recourse loans to eliminate commodity certificate gains or forfeitures to the government is being considered. The proposal aims to save $4.5 billion over 10 years by setting crop loan rates based on market prices, replacing nonrecourse loans with recourse loans to eliminate commodity certificate gains or forfeitures to the government. Farmers can sign up for loan deficiency payments (LDPs) instead of nonrecourse loans, with changes proposed to use monthly county market prices for LDP calculations. The USDA proposal aims to save $250 million over 10 years by implementing changes to the Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) program. Currently, farmers can receive LDPs based on monthly county market prices and hold onto commodities to sell at a later time. The Direct Payment program, enacted in the 2002 farm bill, provides payments to farmers based on commodity base acres, program yield, and payment rate. The direct payment program provides payments to farmers based on historic production and yield, not on actual production or market prices. The Secretary has proposed to continue direct payments and increase rates by about 7% in 2010 for a three-year period through 2012, except for upland cotton which would see an immediate 7% increase. The increase in direct payments aims to maintain payments to farmers under conditions of high market prices and reduced marketing loan program payments. The economic justification for higher direct payments and the potential impact on land prices and rents are questions raised. The USDA's recommendations report highlights concerns about higher direct payments, particularly for upland cotton. The impact of declining U.S. upland cotton textile production on prices and program expenditures is questioned. Additionally, the potential need for crop disaster assistance instead of a proposed increase in direct payments is raised. The USDA's report questions the $5.5 billion proposed increase in direct payments for farmers and suggests using it for crop disaster assistance or crop insurance. Current law does not differentiate among farmers for direct payments eligibility. The Secretary's farm bill proposal includes giving beginning farmers 20% higher direct payments for the first five years, costing $250 million over 10 years. Questions arise about how the USDA will define beginning farmers, how many will benefit, and if the increased direct payment will affect farmland prices. The USDA's report questions the proposed increase in direct payments for farmers and suggests using it for crop disaster assistance or crop insurance. Counter-cyclical payments were adopted in the 2002 farm bill to provide stability during low market prices. The Secretary has proposed changes to trigger payments based on national crop revenue rather than price, incorporating crop yields and production. The proposed change in direct payments for farmers aims to incorporate crop yields and production into the equation, potentially generating savings of $3.7 billion. This shift from price-based to revenue-based counter-cyclical payments raises questions about integrating risk management and the barriers to creating a national program to replace commodity support, crop insurance, and disaster assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of creating a national counter-cyclical revenue program to replace commodity support programs, crop insurance, and disaster assistance for subsidized crops. It questions the effectiveness of the Administration's farm bill proposal and suggests exploring a revenue-based program for unsupported crops. Congress has set limits on commodity support program payments, with a combined limit of $180,000 that can be doubled under certain allowances. The curr_chunk discusses the payment limits for commodity support programs, with a cap of $360,000 under certain allowances and an AGI eligibility cap of $2.5 million. Most farmers find ways to avoid these limits. Cotton and rice farmers feel threatened by payment limits, while proponents argue for lower limits to prevent farm consolidation. Opponents believe large payments are essential for the agricultural safety net. The Secretary has proposed eight changes. The Secretary has proposed eight changes to tighten payment limits for commodity support programs, aiming to prevent evasion of the $360,000 per individual limit and exclude those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income. The proposal is expected to save $1.5 billion from the $75 billion 10-year baseline. Questions arise about the impact on farms, individuals, and absentee landlords receiving commodity program payments. The Secretary's proposal aims to tighten payment limits for commodity support programs, including excluding those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income. Absentee landlords receiving commodity program payments may be impacted by the new AGI limit, potentially leading to changes in tenant-landlord lease contracts towards cash rent. The proposal would prohibit commodity subsidy benefits for farms acquired through a 1031 exchange, with the justification that tax-deferred farmland exchanges contribute to the escalation of farmland prices. Farmland prices are escalating, making it hard for new entrants and small farms to expand. Questions arise about using the 1031 exchange for efficiency and if exemptions should be made for farmers. Studies show commodity subsidies impact land prices, raising the question of whether redesigning these programs should be considered. Discussions are ongoing about eliminating 1031 exchanges for farmland and consulting with relevant committees. The federal government supports farm milk prices through the Dairy Price Support Program at $9.90 per hundredweight. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program provides payments to dairy farmers when market prices fall below $16.94/cwt. The program expires in 2007 with no funding in the budget. Discussions are ongoing about eliminating 1031 exchanges for farmland and consulting with relevant committees. The MILC program, set to expire in 2007, provides payments to dairy farmers when market prices fall below $16.94/cwt. The Administration recommends renewing the program at a 34% payment rate for FY2008, gradually reducing it to 20% over six years. A USDA study questions the effectiveness of current dairy programs, suggesting that the MILC program contributes to dairy surpluses and reduces farm milk prices. Large dairy farms argue that the 2.4 million lb. payment limit is biased against them. The federal government's response to concerns about the 2.4 million lb. payment limit for dairy farmers is based on current WTO trade obligations. The WTO views the aggregate measure of support for the dairy price support program to be more than $4.5 billion annually, classified as \"amber box.\" The current U.S. proposal in the Doha Round aims to reduce total amber box support. Since the MILC program's inception in 2002, it has provided total counter-cyclical payments of $2.4 billion over five marketing years. The MILC program has provided $2.4 billion in counter-cyclical payments since 2002. The cost estimate for extending and revising the program is $793 million over 10 years. Proposed changes would base payments on a three-year average of milk marketed, aiming for consistency with other farm bill programs. The rationale for this change and its trade implications are being considered. The MILC program is being revised to base payments on a three-year average of milk marketed, aligning it with other farm bill programs. The support for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar is mandatory under the 2002 farm bill, with prices guaranteed by nonrecourse loans. The United States maintains market prices above support levels by limiting sugar supplies through import barriers and global tariff rate quotas. Mexico has limited access to the U.S. sugar market under NAFTA. Additional supply control measures can be imposed on U.S. sugar when imports are low. The law allows for domestic marketing allotments on U.S. sugar when imports are below 1.532 million short tons. Imports exceeding this amount may result in costs of $1.107 billion over 10 years. The farm bill proposal aims to save $1.107 billion by eliminating the provision to suspend marketing allotments when imports exceed the limit. The law change is expected to save $1.107 billion over 10 years. USDA is exploring alternative programs for sugar producers. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness. Step 1 allowed for a downward adjustment in the adjusted world price for upland cotton, increasing the loan deficiency payment to producers. Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness by implementing Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 allowed for a downward adjustment in the adjusted world price for upland cotton, increasing the loan deficiency payment to producers. Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton when U.S. prices were higher than world prices. The Step 2 provision for upland cotton was repealed by Congress due to violating WTO rules. The USDA's farm bill proposes to eliminate Step 1 and Step 3, as they have been used infrequently and their purposes have disappeared. Additionally, Step 2 for extra long staple (ELS) cotton would also be eliminated. The current farm bill prohibits planting fruits, vegetables, and wild rice on program crop base acres, with violation resulting in loss of payments. Direct payments on base acres are considered minimally trade-distorting for meeting WTO obligations. The USDA farm bill proposal aims to eliminate the planting restriction on fruits, vegetables, and wild rice on base acres to comply with WTO green box rules. This could impact producers of these crops and raises questions about the integration of U.S. agriculture and the effectiveness of current subsidy policies. The USDA farm bill proposal addresses inefficiencies and inequities in the current system regarding base acreage benefits when cropland is converted to nonagricultural uses. The proposal aims to proportionally reduce base acreage when all or part of a farm is sold for nonagricultural purposes, potentially impacting farmers' decisions on selling land to developers. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides assistance to farmers addressing water and soil resource concerns through conservation practices. Limited funding has constrained the program to 14% of the nation's watersheds, with 19,291 contracts covering 15,411,134 acres. The Secretary proposes offering a \"conservation enhanced payment\" to farms with program crop base acres for adopting environmental practices equivalent to the CSP requirements. Farmers choosing this option would forgo certain payments under the 2007 farm bill. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) offers a \"conservation enhanced payment\" option for farmers with program crop base acres to adopt environmental practices equivalent to CSP requirements. This option would require farmers to forgo counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan benefits under the 2007 farm bill. Questions arise about the impact on CSP participants and the federal government's response to the trade-off. Additionally, concerns about farmer costs associated with meeting the Progressive Tier requirement and potential federal assistance are raised. The 2002 farm bill includes \"circuit breaker\" authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust domestic commodity support expenditures to comply with trade agreements. The U.S. annual limit on trade distorting subsidies is $19.1 billion. The Secretary has proposed modifications to accommodate new agreements. Before the 1985 farm bill, conservation programs were funded at less than $1 billion annually, but now there are more than 20 distinct programs. The current conservation portfolio includes over 20 programs with annual spending of $5.2 billion, mainly funded through recent farm bills. The 2002 farm bill authorized significant increases in funding for programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. The proposed 2007 farm bill outlines an increase in funding for agricultural conservation programs to $7.825 billion over 10 years, with changes aimed at consolidating existing programs. The Administration's proposed changes aim to increase administrative efficiencies and reduce participant confusion by consolidating existing conservation programs. There are questions about the expected savings from these consolidations and plans for using them. Additionally, there are concerns about inconsistencies in funding proposals for programs like CSP and EQIP in the farm bill and budget plan. The Administration's proposed changes aim to consolidate existing conservation programs for efficiency. There are concerns about funding disparities between the farm bill and budget plan, particularly for programs like CSP and EQIP. EQIP offers cost-share payments and incentives for conservation practices on private lands through sub-programs like GSWC, Klamath Basin, and CIG. The Secretary recommends consolidating existing cost-share programs into a newly designed EQIP program, along with creating a Regional Water Enhancement Program. The proposal includes additional funding for the CIG program and an increase of $4.25 billion over the OMB 10-year current services baseline. Interest in participating in conservation programs has been high. The proposed program would receive an increase of $4.25 billion over the OMB 10-year baseline. There is a large backlog of unfunded applications in EQIP and other programs, raising questions about how the additional funding will be used and if USDA has the capacity to handle the workload. USDA's farm bill spending estimates show EQIP growing slowly until reaching full spending authority in 2014, prompting questions about the program's seven-year ramp-up period. Some programs targeted for consolidation have specific purposes and eligibility requirements. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides technical and financial assistance to address water and soil resource concerns through conservation. It operates with three tiers, with Tier III receiving the highest payments for addressing additional resource concerns on the entire operation. CSP offers stewardship, maintenance, and cost-share payments. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides financial assistance payments for stewardship, maintenance, cost-share, and enhancement. Limited funding has constrained the program to 298 watersheds out of 2,119. Proposed adjustments include eliminating certain payments, consolidating tiers, creating a ranking system, and increasing funding to $8.5 billion. Key questions include how participation patterns will change and whether the proposed changes will overlap with the Conservation Enhancement Option in Title I. The proposed Private Lands Protection Program aims to consolidate three existing programs: the Farmland Protection Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Healthy Forest Reserve Program. These programs focus on purchasing conservation easements, restoring and protecting rangeland and grasslands, and addressing forest land habitat for threatened species. The Secretary recommends consolidating these programs due to common goals and unique eligibility requirements. The Secretary recommends consolidating the existing easement programs (FRPP, GRP, and HFRP) into a new private lands protection program, with an additional $900 million in funding over 10 years. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) remove cropland for conservation, with CRP being the largest land retirement program. The Secretary recommends reauthorization of CRP with a focus on lands providing the most benefit. The Secretary recommends reauthorization of CRP with an enhanced focus on environmentally sensitive lands for biomass production. Priority would be given to whole-field enrollment for energy-related biomass production, with biomass harvested after nesting season. Rental payments would be limited to income forgone or costs incurred by participants. Some observers question the rationale behind subsidizing cellulose production and the potential conflict between biomass harvesting and the conservation purpose of the program. Prioritization for releasing land from CRP would be based on high demand for commodities. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP) provide assistance to private landowners to restore and protect wetlands. The Secretary recommends consolidating WRP with the floodplain easement program and increasing the enrollment cap to 3.5 million acres. This would result in a $2.125 billion increase over the current services baseline. Consideration is given to the 25% county cropland enrollment cap on CRP and WRP, and the potential impact on local economies. The Administration recommends broadening conservation compliance provisions to include new \"Sod Saver\" rules that would disincentivize converting grassland into crop production, impacting the President's no-net-loss goal. This expands on the existing conservation compliance requirements for farmers participating in USDA programs. The Administration proposes the Sod Saver rule to discourage converting grasslands into crop production by making them ineligible for USDA programs. Questions arise about the effectiveness of Sodbuster, enforcement concerns, and the lack of conservation assistance under Sod Saver. The Administration's Sod Saver rule aims to prevent grasslands from being converted to crop production by excluding them from USDA programs. Concerns include the rationale behind prohibiting conservation assistance on converted land and the costs and responsibilities of monitoring and enforcement. Various funding mechanisms and initiatives provide incentives for beginning and limited-resource farmers in conservation programs. The Administration recommends reserving 10% of farm bill conservation financial assistance for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged producers, and allowing flexibility for reallocation by the Secretary. The Administration recommends reserving 10% of farm bill conservation financial assistance for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged producers, with flexibility for reallocation by the Secretary. $50 million over 10 years is proposed for developing uniform standards for environmental services and establishing credit registries to encourage new private sector environmental markets. Details on the market-based approach and potential return on investment are requested. The Administration proposes allocating 10% of farm bill conservation funds for beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged producers. $50 million over 10 years is suggested for creating uniform environmental standards and credit registries to promote private sector environmental markets. The Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) and Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) may be merged into a new Emergency Landscape Restoration Program to address citizen confusion during natural disasters. The Secretary is recommending consolidating the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) into a new Emergency Landscape Restoration Program to address citizen confusion during natural disasters. Funding for this new program would be discretionary, and questions arise about which agency would administer it and the definition of eligible lands. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) promotes U.S. agricultural exports and advocates for agricultural interests abroad. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC) addresses barriers related to specialty crops, with funding authorized through the 2002 farm bill. Proposed farm bill changes aim to increase TASC funding to $68 million over several years. USDA proposes to increase funding for the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program to $68 million over several years. The initiative aims to allow for larger, multi-disciplinary projects to assist specialty crop growers. USDA requests mandatory funding using CCC's borrowing authority for better project flexibility and improved assistance. The Market Access Program supports U.S. agriculture high-value products in foreign markets through overseas marketing activities with U.S. agricultural associations and cooperatives. The Market Access Program (MAP) funds overseas marketing and promotional activities for U.S. agricultural trade associations, cooperatives, trade groups, and small businesses. It supports generic and brand-name promotion, with funding levels authorized at $875 million over six years. The Administration is considering increasing annual MAP funding by $25 million to address inequities and assist specialty crop producers. The Administration is considering increasing MAP funding by $25 million to assist specialty crop producers. Questions arise about the impact of MAP and the use of unscientific SPS standards as barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. The farm bill proposes a new grant program to address SPS issues for all commodities. The Administration's farm bill proposes a new grant program to address significant SPS barriers affecting U.S. agricultural exports, with a focus on issues like antimicrobial treatments, wood packaging, and biotechnology. The program aims to reduce the need for permanent technical staff, involve the private sector, commission scientific reports, and utilize outside experts. The program would be funded at $2 million annually for 10 years. The USDA is requesting funding for a new grant program to address SPS barriers in international trade. This initiative aims to counter technical trade barriers without scientific basis and increase U.S. involvement in international bodies setting food safety standards. The program would be funded on a mandatory basis using CCC's borrowing authority. The USDA is requesting $15 million over 10 years to enhance staff support at international standard setting organizations to influence decision making and avoid trade barriers. Funding would cover compensation for senior staff and up to four professional officers focusing on U.S. SPS priorities. The lack of U.S. funding has led to a \"more Eurocentric approach\" at the FAO, potentially conflicting with U.S. objectives. The Administration is seeking broad discretionary authority to assist smaller agricultural groups affected by unfair foreign trade practices and to pursue trade dispute cases. This would provide enhanced monitoring, technical assistance, and analytical support to address potential unfair competition in the domestic U.S. market. The Administration is seeking broad discretionary authority to assist smaller agricultural groups affected by unfair foreign trade practices and to pursue trade dispute cases. This would enable USDA to direct resources to help smaller agricultural groups and industries affected by unfair trade practices and to pursue trade dispute cases on their behalf. The Administration proposes $20 million in funding over 10 years through CCC's borrowing authority to expand agricultural extension and food safety programs in fragile countries like Sudan or Somalia. USDA would engage in agricultural reconstruction efforts to support those reliant on agriculture for food and employment. This aims to meet future development assistance needs in unstable areas. Key questions include how funding agricultural extension efforts in fragile countries would facilitate U.S. agricultural trade and how trade capacity building would function in very unstable circumstances. USDA administers export credit guarantee programs to facilitate sales of U.S. agricultural exports. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) guarantees repayment for U.S. agricultural exports sold to foreign buyers through financing from private U.S. financial institutions. The guarantee ensures favorable interest rates and longer repayment periods. Programs like GSM-102, GSM-103, SCGP, and FGP support short-term, intermediate-term, deferred payment sales, and facility improvements in emerging markets. The 2002 farm bill authorized up to $6.5 billion annually for these guarantee programs, with $1.0 billion targeted for emerging markets. The 2002 farm bill authorized up to $6.5 billion annually for guarantee programs, with $1.0 billion targeted for emerging markets. USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service determines allocation between short and intermediate term programs based on market conditions. Program activity has declined in recent years due to less demand and WTO ruling on export subsidies. In FY2006, USDA approved almost $1.4 billion in guarantees, down from previous years. Budget outlay impact is small, reflecting only administrative costs and loan subsidies. Administration proposes statutory changes to reform guarantee programs in light of WTO ruling. The Administration proposes statutory changes to reform guarantee programs in light of the WTO ruling. Changes include removing the 1% cap on fees for the GSM-102 program, eliminating the GSM-103 program, terminating the SCGP due to loan defaults and fraud, and revising the FGP to attract more users. These changes are not expected to have a significant budgetary impact. The USDA established the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) in 1985 to help U.S. commodities compete with other countries. The program has been inactive in recent years, with an annual program level of $478 million. The 2002 farm bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with Congress every two years and prepare a Global Market Strategy report. The administrative costs for preparing one report are about $250,000. The USDA proposes to repeal the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Global Market Strategy report mandate due to program inactivity and redundancy. This would allow the USDA to focus resources on priority issues and align with the U.S. objective to eliminate export subsidies worldwide. The administrative costs for preparing one report are about $250,000. The USDA provides various food aid programs abroad, including the P.L. 480 program, Food for Progress Program, McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, and Section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. These programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill, with funding provided through annual appropriations. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust was created to provide food aid under certain circumstances, and the McGovern-Dole program was established as a new food aid program. Title I provides low-interest loans for U.S. agricultural commodity purchases, while Title II donates commodities for emergency and non-emergency food needs. Funding levels for these programs have ranged from $1.6 to $1.7 billion annually. The Food for Progress Program supports countries expanding free enterprise in agriculture, and the McGovern-Dole program provides food aid for education and nutrition programs in foreign countries. The 2002 farm bill mandated CCC funding of $100 million in FY2003, with appropriations authorized from FY2004 to FY2007. The Emerson Trust provides emergency food relief when U.S. supplies are short or to meet unanticipated need. Title II of P.L. 480 may only be used to purchase and ship U.S. agricultural commodities for food needs overseas. The Administration argues for authority to quickly meet emergency needs by using cash for immediate relief or filling gaps in the food aid pipeline, as U.S.-sourced food aid typically takes longer to arrive compared to locally purchased commodities. The Administration proposes using up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase of emergency food to respond quickly to food security crises. Questions raised include past examples of using this authority, identifying countries for food purchases, adequacy of current food aid resources, additional funding for the McGovern-Dole program, and the impact of the Administration's focus on emergency food aid. The Administration proposes using up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for emergency food aid, raising questions about the impact on food aid for development purposes and the willingness of U.S. groups to support the program. Retirement plans like IRAs and SEP plans are not excluded as assets for food stamp eligibility, and states can expand the federal disregard to match their TANF rules. The Administration proposes disregarding all retirement savings and plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, aligning with TANF rules. This aims to promote retirement savings and simplify asset evaluation for food stamp recipients. The Administration proposes disregarding all retirement savings and plans as assets for food stamp eligibility to promote retirement savings and simplify asset evaluation for recipients. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while the Administration estimates costs at $548 million over five years and $1.305 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposal for retirement savings and food stamp eligibility raises questions about informal retirement savings, asset limits, and standardizing asset counting rules. The complexity of asset evaluation for food stamp eligibility and the potential cost-effectiveness of maintaining asset tests are also under scrutiny. The Administration proposes a pilot project to test the effectiveness of allowing states to pay for work-related expenses of food stamp recipients with earnings from employment, aiming to strengthen the program's support for work and moving recipients towards self-sufficiency. The Administration proposes a pilot project to test the effectiveness of allowing states to pay for work-related expenses of food stamp recipients with earnings from employment. The project aims to strengthen the program's support for work and moving recipients towards self-sufficiency. Critics question the limitations placed on the project and its ability to produce meaningful results. The Administration proposes to eliminate caps on expense deductions for dependent care costs in the Food Stamp program to help working families. Critics argue for recognizing high non-food living expenses like shelter costs. The estimated cost of this proposal is $20 million over five years and $42 million over 10 years. The Administration's proposal aims to eliminate caps on dependent care expense deductions in the Food Stamp program, costing $20 million over five years and $42 million over 10 years. Additionally, the policy allows for disregarding college savings plans as assets, with state agencies making individual determinations on their accessibility. The Administration proposes to disregard IRS-approved postsecondary education savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, aiming to encourage education savings, eliminate penalties for temporary food assistance needs, and simplify program administration. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while others argue the current rule already allows for some asset disregards. The Administration's proposal aims to disregard IRS-approved postsecondary education savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, with estimated costs of $8 million over five years and $18 million over 10 years. Questions raised include the number of food stamp applicants affected, treatment of informal education savings, consideration of raising the $2,000 asset limit, and rules governing counting vehicles for food stamp eligibility. The Administration's proposal aims to standardize and simplify rules for disregarding vehicles as assets for food stamp eligibility. Combat-related military pay has been disregarded as income in the Food Stamp program since FY2005, and the proposal seeks to make this a permanent part of food stamp law. The Administration's proposal aims to permanently disregard combat-related military pay as income for food stamp eligibility. Critics suggest using the Defense Department's Family Assistance Supplemental Allowance program instead. The estimated cost of the proposal is $5 million over five years and $10 million over 10 years. The Food Stamp program, originally established in 1939, used actual stamps for recipients to purchase surplus commodities. The program was closed in 1943 due to surplus food production after World War II. Revived in the 1960s, it switched to paper coupons and later electronic benefit transfer cards. The Administration recommends changing the program to the Defense Department's Family Assistance Supplemental Allowance program. The Food Stamp program, established in 1939, used stamps to purchase surplus commodities. It has since transitioned to electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards. The Administration suggests renaming the program to the Food and Nutrition program to reflect the changes in delivery methods and focus on nutrition. Questions include the cost of renaming, the number of states using alternative names for their EBT programs, and the possibility of keeping the existing name. The Administration proposes to \"de-obligate\" unredeemed food stamp coupons to save costs. They estimate savings of $2 million over five years and $7 million over 10 years. The proposal aims to make outstanding coupons no longer usable and sets a deadline for redemption. States are required to pursue collection of over-issued benefits, with the federal government covering program costs. The Administration also addresses liability for over-issued benefits caused by state agency negligence or fraud. The Administration proposes to de-obligate unredeemed food stamp coupons to save costs, estimating savings of $2 million over five years and $7 million over 10 years. They also address liability for over-issued benefits caused by state agency negligence or fraud, prohibiting states from pursuing claims against recipients for widespread systemic errors and requiring states to pay for over-issuances in such cases. Critics are concerned about the potential chilling effect on state efforts to improve administration. The Administration is proposing to hold states accountable for over-issued benefits due to systemic errors, potentially impacting state innovation in food stamp administration. This includes new authority to collect over-issuance costs from states and addressing liability for negligence or fraud. Critics are concerned about the impact on state efforts to improve administration. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict automatic eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, to prevent potential abuse of the system. Critics argue that many working households with high non-food expenses rely on this eligibility, and penalizing those who have transitioned off cash welfare and only receive child care. The Administration's proposal aims to limit food stamp eligibility to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, potentially affecting households who have transitioned off cash welfare and only receive child care. Critics argue that this could result in some households losing eligibility for free school meals. The proposal is estimated to save $611 million over five years and $1.360 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposal aims to limit food stamp eligibility to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, potentially affecting households who have transitioned off cash welfare and only receive child care. Critics argue that this could result in some households losing eligibility for free school meals. The proposal is estimated to save $611 million over five years and $1.360 billion over 10 years. The Administration's recommendation raises questions about the number of households affected by the categorical eligibility limitation proposal and the primary source of budget savings in the Administration's package of farm bill proposals for nutrition assistance programs. It also questions the feasibility of states providing minimal cash payments to circumvent the proposal and the added administrative costs for states conducting regular food stamp eligibility determinations for those losing categorical eligibility. The Administration is proposing to give more flexibility in imposing penalties on retailers violating food stamp rules. They want the authority to impose fines for minor violations and fines in addition to disqualification for major violations. Critics are concerned about the lack of clarity on the extent of the problem and the Administration's failure to use existing authority to impose fines in minor cases. There are also concerns about potential clashes with other laws imposing penalties on retailers convicted of felonies/misdemeanors. The Administration is proposing new authority to impose fines on retailers for minor violations of food stamp rules, in addition to disqualification for major violations. They estimate savings of $5 million over five years and $10 million over 10 years from these proposals. The proposal aims to increase the effectiveness of USDA enforcement actions by allowing the seizure of retailers' food stamp receipts in certain egregious trafficking cases prior to settlement. This would hurt trafficking retailers in their pocketbooks and expedite enforcement actions. The Administration is proposing new authority to seize retailers' food stamp receipts in certain egregious trafficking cases to increase the effectiveness of USDA enforcement actions. Critics are concerned about how this new authority would be framed and used, and whether it provides enough protections for accused retailers. The Administration proposes to disqualify those who exchange food purchased with food stamp benefits for cash. They also consider making this exchange a felony or misdemeanor, subject to fines or imprisonment. The Food Stamp program has a \"quality control\" system to measure erroneous determinations in benefit payments. The national overpayment rate for food stamp benefits was 4.53%, with underpayments at 1.31%. States with high error rates may face fiscal sanctions. Eight states are at risk, with total liabilities of $3.6 million. Some states receive bonus payments for low error rates. The QC system also measures improper denials, suspensions, or terminations of food stamp applicants/recipients. The national average negative action error rate was 6.91% in FY2005. In FY2005, the national average negative action error rate was 6.91%. States with high error rates may receive bonus payments or face fiscal sanctions. Overpayment and underpayment rates were at a historic low, while negative action error rates have been rising. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics are concerned about the impact on the 2002 farm bill negotiations. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics are concerned about the impact on the 2002 farm bill negotiations and the large penalty amounts imposed. The proposed sanctions are significantly higher than those for food stamp overpayments and underpayments. The Administration estimates savings of $57 million over five years and $166 million over 10 years. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics are concerned about the impact on the 2002 farm bill negotiations and the large penalty amounts imposed. The proposed sanctions are significantly higher than those for food stamp overpayments and underpayments. The Administration estimates savings of $57 million over five years and $166 million over 10 years. The Administration intends to include cuts in federal matching payments for state costs like nutrition education and work and training programs in the proposed sanction. States at risk of a fiscal sanction for consistently high error rates may meet a portion of the sanction by investing in federally approved improvements to the administration of the Food Stamp program. Critics argue that eliminating the option for states to invest in administrative improvements unnecessarily re-opens the 2002 agreement without sufficient rationale. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics argue that this recommendation unnecessarily re-opens the 2002 agreement without sufficient rationale. The Administration estimates minimal cost savings from this proposal. The USDA allows states to invest in administrative improvements instead of paying fiscal sanctions. The Administration also proposes adding specific language to the Food Stamp Act regarding nutrition education as an approved activity under the program. The Administration proposes to add specific language to the Food Stamp Act referring to nutrition education as an approved activity under the program. Current USDA nutrition programs support nutrition education activities to combat rising obesity rates among Americans. Efforts include funding state nutrition education, providing materials for schoolchildren, revising school meal program patterns, and mandatory nutrition education in the WIC program. The Administration also calls for competitive grants to address obesity in the low-income population with evaluations of the results. The Administration proposes a $20 million per year USDA Initiative to Address Obesity among Low-Income Americans, including grants for point-of-sale incentives, connecting food stamp shoppers with farmers' markets, and education programs. Key questions include coordination with existing child nutrition and WIC programs, and the reasons for a separate grant initiative. States must submit plans for USDA approval every four years for distributing TEFAP commodities and setting eligibility standards. The Administration proposes to make TEFAP state plans effectively permanent, with revisions only required for changes in operations or rules. Critics question the burden of resubmitting plans every four years, noting the importance of TEFAP state plans in program improvements. The current requirement for new state TEFAP plans every four years may be burdensome for both the USDA and state agencies. States have control over selecting organizations to distribute TEFAP foods, leading to concerns about efficiency and effectiveness. The Administration is considering making state plans permanent with revisions only for operational changes. The Administration proposes re-competing contracts with TEFAP distributing organizations every three years to encourage efficiency and lower fees. Critics question the need for frequent re-competition, the feasibility of finding serious competitors, and the potential confusion for recipients. The Administration's proposal involves re-competing contracts for TEFAP distributing agencies every three years to increase efficiency and reduce fees. Critics raise concerns about the frequency of re-competition, finding suitable competitors, and potential confusion among recipients. Additionally, the Administration is revising the method for allocating federal payments for administrative costs for FDPIR, aiming for a closer tie to participants served. Increased FDPIR administrative funding of $26-$27 million over 10 years is requested to support the implementation of the revised allocation. The Administration is requesting increased FDPIR administrative funding of $26-$27 million over 10 years to ensure tribal organizations receive their current allotments or a modest increase. Critics question if this initiative belongs in the farm bill and if the new allocation method will be detailed in the proposal. The Administration's goal could potentially be achieved through the regular appropriations process. The Administration is proposing changes to food stamp laws to disqualify those disqualified from the FDPIR program, aiming to promote program integrity. Critics question the need for new provisions in law, suggesting that existing regulations could achieve the same goal. The Administration proposes changes to food stamp laws to disqualify individuals disqualified from the FDPIR program. This includes disregarding the value of SFMNP vouchers in means-tested public assistance programs and prohibiting states from participating in the SFMNP if sales taxes are charged on purchases. The Administration proposes changes to food stamp laws to disqualify individuals disqualified from the FDPIR program, including disregarding the value of SFMNP vouchers in means-tested public assistance programs and prohibiting states from participating in the SFMNP if sales taxes are charged on purchases. Additionally, the Administration recommends a $6 million survey every five years on foods purchased by schools for their meal services to align with Dietary Guidelines for Americans and assess economic effects on commodity sectors. Critics question if this proposal belongs in the farm bill. The Administration proposes to provide an additional $50 million a year for the purchase of fruit and vegetables specifically for the School Lunch program, above acquisitions under any other authority. Critics are concerned about the lack of increase in fruit and vegetable purchases and the silence on expanding existing programs in some schools and Indian reservations. The Administration's proposals include an additional $50 million annually for fruit and vegetable purchases for the School Lunch program. Questions remain about the expansion of existing programs in schools and Indian reservations, distribution of funds among schools, and whether the funding will be mandatory. Section 32 provides a permanent appropriation for supporting the farm sector, with a portion allocated for purchasing non-price-supported commodities for schools and feeding sites. The Administration proposes to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables using Section 32 authority by at least $200 million per year, and $2.75 billion over 10 years. Critics are concerned about the impact on support for other commodities. The budget effect of the proposal indicates no new spending, with questions about how the cost will be covered. The Administration's farm bill proposals include increasing fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million per year using Section 32 authority, totaling $2.75 billion over 10 years. Questions arise about how the cost will be covered, potential reductions in purchases of other products, unobligated funds in the Section 32 account, the need for new legislative authority, and ensuring future implementation by Congress. The Administration's farm bill proposals include increasing fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million per year using Section 32 authority, totaling $2.75 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to enhance loan availability for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, increase the maximum size of individual direct loans, and make revisions to farm loan programs. The Administration proposes to target more of the FSA direct loan portfolio to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers by doubling the targeting percentage for direct operating loans and increasing the targeting of direct farm ownership loans. New re-pooling procedures would redistribute funds to targeted groups of farmers before others. The Administration proposes to enhance loan programs for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers by lowering interest rates, eliminating property value caps, decreasing producer contributions, deferring payments, and increasing borrower limits to a combined $500,000 for direct farm ownership and operating loans. These changes aim to address inflation and make it easier for targeted groups to access funds. The proposed $500,000 combined limit on direct farm operating and farm ownership loans is not indexed for inflation, unlike guaranteed loans dating from 1998. Farmers may have more flexibility with the combined cap, but it is only slightly higher than the current $400,000 total. The 2002 farm bill required a study on the effectiveness of USDA's loan programs, questioning the need for direct loans in rural housing programs. The USDA is questioned about the necessity of direct rural housing loans compared to direct farm loans. The pilot program to guarantee contract land sales under the 2002 farm bill is discussed, along with the success rate and reauthorization. The Administration's stance on expanding the lending authority of the Farm Credit System is also queried. The Rural Development mission area of the USDA includes the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service, with support from the Office of Community Development. The USDA Rural Development provides support for community development through various programs, including the Critical Access Hospital Program. The program aims to ensure access to healthcare services in rural areas and develop local integrated health delivery systems. The Administration proposes mandatory funding for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of all certified Rural Critical Access Hospitals. Since FY2004, USDA has supported 53 critical access hospitals with loans and guarantees totaling $260 million. The USDA has provided $260 million in loans and guarantees to support 53 critical access hospitals since FY2004. The Administration is proposing $500 million in the 2007 farm bill to address backlogged loan and grant applications for infrastructure projects. The funding aims to improve infrastructure and provide essential services for sustainable economic development. The Administration's 2008 budget proposes terminating the Community Facilities Grant program and \"Community Connect\" Broadband Grants. The farm bill reauthorization is proposed for broadband access, distance learning, and telemedicine programs. The Administration is considering an additional $500 million for the infrastructure backlog. Loans and grants for business development in rural areas are also discussed. The USDA Rural Development programs offer assistance to rural businesses, public bodies, and nonprofits in business planning, labor training, and technical assistance. The Administration's farm bill proposes consolidating various grant programs into new platforms, including a Business Grants Platform and a Multi-Departmental Energy Grants Platform. Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements grant programs would be consolidated under the Biomass Research and Development Act with proposed funding of $500 million over 10 years. The Administration is proposing to increase funding for renewable energy systems to $150 million over 10 years. The Department of Energy is investing $385 million in biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks. The proposed energy grants would prioritize funding for biorefinery construction and raise the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to $100 million, aiming to provide quality employment and economic development potential for rural America. The Administration is proposing to increase funding for renewable energy systems to $150 million over 10 years, with a focus on biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks. The loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants would be raised to $100 million, and the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Loan Guarantee Program would be consolidated under this platform. The proposed funding would support $2.17 billion of guaranteed loans over 10 years, with a priority on biorefinery construction. The Administration is proposing to increase funding for renewable energy systems to $150 million over 10 years, with a focus on biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks.

The proposed funding would support $2.17 billion of guaranteed loans over 10 years, with a priority on biorefinery construction. The Administration also aims to consolidate separate legal authorities for rural grants programs into a single law to enhance assistance to rural areas and address obstacles within the USDA Rural Development's mission agencies. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposes terminating Rural Business Enterprise Grants and Rural Business Opportunity Grants, citing duplication with programs from other federal agencies. Concerns arise about potential neglect of rural areas by these agencies and the impact on entrepreneurial efforts in rural areas. The FY2008 budget proposes consolidating various community programs, including those targeting rural areas with high unemployment. Concerns are raised about potential neglect of rural areas by other federal agencies if programs like Economic Impact Grants and Community Facility Grants are terminated. Funding for rural development assistance in these agencies is questioned. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized USDA programs in agricultural research, education, and economics through FY2007. USDA's Research, Extension, and Economics (REE) mission area includes ARS, CSREES, ERS, and NASS. The Administration proposes consolidating ARS and CSREES into REES. The Administration proposes consolidating ARS and CSREES into a single agency called the Research, Education, and Extension Service (REES), with the head titled Chief Scientist. Land grant universities also suggest a reorganization plan (CREATE-21) to combine ARS and CSREES, keep ERS and NASS in the research mission area, and establish a national institute for research on food and agriculture. In the mid-1970s, the Carter Administration merged ARS, CSRS, and the Extension Service into the Science and Education Administration (SEA). The Administration proposes consolidating ARS and CSREES into a single agency called the Research, Education, and Extension Service (REES), with the head titled Chief Scientist. The Carter Administration merged ARS, CSRS, and the Extension Service into the Science and Education Administration (SEA) in the mid-1970s. The 1994 USDA reorganization combined CSRS and the Extension Service to form CSREES, but intramural and extramural research programs have remained separate for over 25 years. The proposed Chief Scientist is expected to create a well-coordinated single agency united behind its mission. The Administration's proposal includes consolidating ARS and CSREES into a single agency called REES, with a Chief Scientist leading the agency. The Forest Service conducts research on public and private forest lands, receiving $250 million annually through the Department of Interior budget. Land grant universities propose bringing Forest Service research under the same administrative umbrella as ARS and CSREES. The Administration has proposed cutting formula funds to states while keeping ARS appropriations the same. The Administration's proposal includes merging ARS and CSREES into a single agency called REES, with a focus on competitive grants over formula funds for research funding. The CREATE-21 proposal aims to double funding for agricultural research and extension without disadvantaging any institutions financially. The Administration may use mandatory funds to support this increase in funding. The Administration proposes creating an Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative with $50 million in annual mandatory funding for 10 years. This initiative aims to make agricultural biomass a viable alternative to petroleum and develop industrial products from bioenergy byproducts. Questions arise about potential displacement of current ARS work, Department of Energy's management control, and collaboration between public and private research. The Administration proposes a new Specialty Crops Research Initiative with $100 million in annual funding. Questions remain about the division of funding between intramural and extramural programs, potential staff additions or shifts in priorities, and assurance of implementation. Plum Island Animal Disease Center, now under DHS, continues to conduct research with USDA personnel. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center, built in the 1950s, is outdated and unable to meet current biosecurity research needs. The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace it with the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) at an estimated cost of $451 million. Congress has allocated $46 million for planning and site selection. DHS has reviewed submissions from interested locations and selected 18 sites for further consideration. Construction is expected to be completed by 2013. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center, built in the 1950s, is outdated and unable to meet current biosecurity research needs. The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace it with the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) at an estimated cost of $451 million. Congress has allocated $46 million for planning and site selection. Construction is expected to be completed by 2013. Plum Island is the only facility in the United States approved to study high-consequence foreign livestock diseases like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a specially designed BSL-3 bio-containment area. The Administration proposes changing the law to allow research on highly infectious foreign animal diseases on mainland U.S. locations. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center and USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, IA are the only BSL-3 agriculture facilities in the U.S. The intended NBAF is likely to be another BSL-3 facility, with the possibility of a BSL-4 facility. The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace the outdated Plum Island Animal Disease Center with the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Canada or Australia. There are concerns about the location of the new facility, potential security risks, and the involvement of the USDA in the decision-making process. Critics worry about the risks of locating the facility in regions where livestock are raised, especially in terms of security breaches and terrorism threats. The text discusses the risks and advantages of building the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas compared to Plum Island. It also raises questions about the risk factors in site selection and compares the risks between animal and human diseases. Additionally, it mentions the USDA's Forest Service and the proposed programs in the 2007 farm bill related to forestry. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes new programs for forestry, including statewide planning, forestry grants, wood-to-energy technology development, and community forest conservation. The Forest Land Enhancement Program (FLEP) is not being reauthorized. The proposed programs aim to address public demand for forest products, land use pressure, and wildfire risk. The proposed statewide planning, technology development, and community forests aim to address the growth in demand for forest products and amenities, land use pressure, and wildfire risk. Questions arise about the effectiveness of these programs compared to direct landowner assistance like FLEP, the lack of private landowner assistance in the 2007 proposal, and funding for the new planning effort amidst proposed cuts to forest stewardship funding. Additionally, concerns are raised about the flexibility of national direction for statewide forest planning and the ability of state forestry organizations to undertake planning without federal oversight. The Administration's farm bill proposal includes a new landscape-scale forestry competitive grant program to address local forest management issues, develop nontraditional forest product markets, and stimulate local economies. Significant problems identified include the aging of family forest landowners and potential forest fragmentation. Questions arise about how landscapes will be defined for the grants and if cooperative involvement of landowners is required. The program aims to ensure a comprehensive, coordinated approach to forest management and collaboration across ownership boundaries. The proposal includes a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to use low-grade woody biomass for cellulosic ethanol. Questions are raised about the program goals, measurement of progress, and potential impact on forest ownership. The proposal includes a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to use low-grade woody biomass for cellulosic ethanol. Questions are raised about program goals, measurement of progress, potential impact on forest ownership, and comparison with burning biomass for electricity production. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes a community forests working lands program to assist communities in acquiring and conserving forests for goods and services production at the urban fringe. The program's differences from the existing Forest Legacy program and federal funding responsibilities are also discussed. The proposed community forests program in the Administration's 2007 farm bill aims to assist communities in acquiring and conserving forests for goods and services production at the urban fringe. It differs from the existing Forest Legacy program and raises questions about federal funding responsibilities. The 2007 farm bill also includes modifications to programs for renewable energy research and production, but does not mention several expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill related to biorefinery grants, biodiesel fuel education, energy audit programs, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, and carbon sequestration. The 2007 farm bill includes provisions on renewable energy research and production, as well as the proposed community forests program. Questions arise about federal funding responsibilities for the community forests program. The bill does not mention expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill related to biorefinery grants, biodiesel fuel education, energy audit programs, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, and carbon sequestration. The USDA's energy proposal calls for increased funding for the Renewable Energy Program, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol projects. Coordination between USDA and the Department of Energy is also a key focus. The Renewable Energy Program aims to promote projects focusing on cellulosic ethanol for renewable energy development. Questions remain about the potential of cellulosic ethanol and its economic implications. Challenges include biomass material handling and competition with cattle forage on marginal lands. Concerns exist about degrading Conservation Reserve Program acreage for cellulosic feedstock. The cellulosic ethanol industry raises concerns about competition with cattle forage and potential degradation of Conservation Reserve Program acreage. Questions arise about the future of corn-based ethanol plants and the impact on individuals who have invested in them. Tariffs protect American ethanol blenders from foreign competition, but some argue it hinders the development of the industry. The tariff on ethanol imports from Brazil is extended through 2008, hindering the development of a national distribution network in major coastal regions of the United States. Questions are raised about the justification of the tariff and why there is no similar protection for biodiesel or palm oil industries. The U.S. ethanol sector receives significant support through tax credits and a Renewable Fuels Standard. Total federal support for ethanol production is substantial. The federal support for ethanol production has increased from $5.1 to $6.8 billion annually. The Administration is considering changes to the Federal Procurement of Biobased Products program to enhance its effectiveness. There are concerns that subsidies for ethanol may hinder the development of new sustainable energy technologies. The Administration proposes to consolidate loan program authorities, prioritize funding for biorefinery construction, and raise the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to $100 million. The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Loan Guarantee Program would be consolidated under this platform with increased funding to $210 million. Emphasis would be on energy development in rural areas, particularly cellulosic ethanol production, despite technical obstacles. The government plans to prioritize funding for corn-based ethanol to meet renewable fuel targets. Questions arise about the level of funding for this technology and potential impacts on other renewable energy sources. The proposal includes consolidating energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act with $500 million in mandatory funding over 10 years. Additionally, there will be a focus on rural energy development, particularly in cellulosic ethanol production, despite technical challenges. The Biomass Research and Development Act proposes consolidating Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements grant programs with $500 million in mandatory funding over 10 years. Competitive grants would increase to $150 million over 10 years. Questions arise about the funding's focus on diverse renewable energy types and geographic locations or on establishing a cellulosic ethanol industry. The DOE is investing $385 million in biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks, raising the need for additional USDA energy grants funding coordination. The multi-department energy grants platform could provide quality employment and economic development potential for rural America. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) remove active cropland into conservation uses, typically for 10 years, and provide annual rental payments based on the agricultural rental value of the land and cost-share assistance. CRP is the largest land retirement program with spending of $1.828 billion in FY2005. The Secretary is recommending reauthorization of this program with an enhanced focus on lands that provide the most benefit for environmentally sensitive lands, prioritizing whole-field enrollment for lands utilized for energy-related biomass production. Biomass would be harvested after nesting season, and rental payments would be limited to income foregone or costs incurred by the participant to meet conservation requirements in those years biomass was harvested for energy production. The proposal includes consolidating USDA energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, with mandatory funding of $500 million over 10 years. Additionally, a new Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative is proposed. The Administration proposes a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to develop technologies for using low-grade woody biomass. Key questions include potential displacement of current ARS work, Department of Energy management control, and collaboration between public and private research. The proposal aims to develop technologies for utilizing low-grade woody biomass to improve forest health and reduce wildfire risks. Key questions include the potential for converting biomass to cellulosic ethanol versus burning it for electricity, along with cost factors and other critical considerations for biomass utilization. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized and has seen enhancements in legislation since 1980. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 allocated $8.2 billion in federal spending over five years to enhance crop insurance through premium subsidies. Despite increased subsidies, the goal of eliminating disaster payments has not been met. The Administration's farm bill proposal includes recommendations to improve crop insurance participation, reduce costs, and address fraud and abuse issues. The Administration's proposed changes to the crop insurance program aim to address waste, fraud, and abuse, reduce costs, and decrease the need for emergency disaster payments. One significant change includes allowing farmers to purchase insurance for their deductible portion not covered by existing crop insurance. Other cost-saving measures include reducing premium subsidies, charging premiums for catastrophic coverage, and requiring farmers to buy crop insurance to participate in support programs. The estimated annual cost of the proposed supplemental deductible coverage is $35 million. The Administration proposes changes to the crop insurance program to reduce costs and decrease the need for emergency disaster payments. The estimated annual cost of the proposed supplemental deductible coverage is $35 million. Congress has historically provided about $2 billion per year in disaster payments. The proposal includes increasing farmer-paid premiums and mandatory linkage to crop insurance for participation in support programs. Farm groups have previously opposed mandatory linkage and may react similarly to the current proposal. The Section 32 program allocates approximately $7 billion yearly to the USDA for child nutrition programs. A portion of this funding is used to purchase non-price-supported commodities for schools and feeding sites. Fruit and vegetable purchases under Section 32 have averaged $308 million per year. USDA plans to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually, but this proposal is not reflected in the Administration's FY2008 budget. The Section 32 program allocates $7 billion yearly to USDA for child nutrition programs, including fruit and vegetable purchases. USDA plans to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually, but this proposal is not in the Administration's FY2008 budget. Questions arise about how the increased purchases will be funded, if other food purchases will be reduced, the level of unobligated funds in the Section 32 account, the need for new legislative authority, and how the initiative will be ensured by future Administrations. The Department of Agriculture plans to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually for child nutrition programs through the Section 32 program. Questions remain about funding sources, potential reductions in other food purchases, unobligated funds in the account, the need for new legislative authority, and ensuring the initiative's continuity across future Administrations. Additionally, the Administration's 2007 farm bill proposal recommends increased funding for research and marketing programs to support organic farming growth, with gaps in organic regulations possibly needing addressing for better enforcement. Funding for enforcement activities would require additional personnel and resources. The Department of Agriculture is looking to increase fruit and vegetable purchases for child nutrition programs, with questions about funding sources and the need for new legislative authority. Funding for enforcement activities to support organic farming growth would require additional personnel and resources."
