    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2015\". Congress finds that as of the date of enactment of this Act, there are 113,000,000 acres of onshore Federal land open for oil and natural gas development, while approximately 166,000,000 acres are off-limits. Despite a recent boom in the industry, the number of leased Federal land for exploration has decreased by 24 percent since 2008. This reduction harms economic growth and Federal revenues. In 2013, only 36,000,000 acres were leased, compared to 131,000,000 acres in 1984. It took 197 days to process drilling permits on Federal land in 2013, while States have sufficient regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nAvailable Federal land refers to Federal land within a State that is not held by the United States for a federally recognized Indian tribe, not part of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, or a congressionally designated wilderness area. State includes a State and the District of Columbia. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program refers to a State law program regulating energy exploration and development on State land.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE CONTROL OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ON ALL AVAILABLE FEDERAL LAND. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory programs allow states to declare and seek responsibility for leasing, permitting, and regulating energy development on federal land. States can take action to lease, permit, and regulate energy exploration without federal involvement. Energy development activities such as gas extraction are exempt from certain federal regulations including the Administrative Procedure Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. This exemption allows states to independently manage leasing, permitting, and regulation of energy development on federal land. Any lease or permit issued by a State under section 4 must collect royalties or revenues equivalent to what would have been collected by the Federal Government. Revenues collected by a State for leasing on Federal land will be deposited in the same Federal account. States can still charge processing fees for lease or permit applications."
