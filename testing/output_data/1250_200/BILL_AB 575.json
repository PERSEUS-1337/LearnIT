The state board may reduce the fee for small publishers or manufacturers participating in followup adoption. Small publisher or manufacturer defined as independently owned, not dominant, with 100 or fewer employees, and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees is budgeted for reimbursements and review of instructional materials. If little interest, followup adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for followup adoption costs. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date."
