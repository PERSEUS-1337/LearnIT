    "content": "In 2003, the United States exported 1.3 million metric tons of beef and beef products worth $3.9 billion, accounting for 10% of the farm value of U.S. cattle. Beef exports grew by 85% from 1992 to 2003, while domestic consumption only increased by 14%. Following the 2003 BSE announcement, many countries banned or restricted U.S. beef imports, including Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. By 2007, Brazil became the top beef exporter with 32% of the world market share. In 2007, Brazil became the top beef exporter with 32% of the world market share, followed by Australia with 19%. The United States is the largest beef importer, with imports representing about 13% of total consumption. Canada was a major source of beef imports before its own BSE event in May 2003. The OIE recognized the United States, Canada, and other countries as having \"controlled risk\" status for BSE. The Administration urges beef importing countries to acknowledge this determination and reopen their markets to U.S. beef. The Administration urges beef importing countries to acknowledge the OIE determination and reopen their markets to U.S. beef. U.S. exports have gradually increased, with a market share of almost 9% in 2007. Beef, veal, and beef variety meat exports reached over 771,000 MT valued at $2.7 billion in 2007. Mexico and Canada were major importers, while Japan and Korea imported a smaller volume. Korea lifted its prohibition on U.S. beef in 2006, accepting only boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age. Korea initially accepted only boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age, but later rejected shipments due to bone fragments and dioxin levels. After a new agreement in 2008, Korea agreed to reopen its market to all U.S. beef products, with specific guidelines for the removal of specified risk materials. The United States and Korea reached an agreement in 2008 to reopen the Korean market to all U.S. beef products, with guidelines for removing specified risk materials. Korea initially accepted boneless beef from cattle under 30 months but later rejected shipments due to bone fragments and dioxin levels. The reopening process was expected to take effect on May 15, 2008, with special labeling requirements for certain steak exports and restrictions on beef from Canadian-sourced cattle. The Korean market reopening for U.S. beef products has been delayed due to backlash from consumers and opposition politicians. The Korean government requested that beef from cattle older than 30 months not be shipped, leading to disappointment from U.S. officials. The U.S. meat industry has lost billions in sales to Korea since 2003, and the market remained closed in early June 2008. The U.S. meat industry has lost billions in sales to Korea since 2003. The U.S. is working towards regaining its historic share of Korean beef imports, which was around 50% before the 2003 BSE event. The U.S.-Korea free trade agreement could potentially increase U.S. beef exports by $600 million to $1.8 billion. Lawmakers are pushing for Korea to fully open its market for U.S. beef before implementing the FTA. The United States and Japan reached an agreement in 2004 on an interim U.S. marketing program for U.S. beef exports to Japan. This program certified that only beef products from cattle of 20 months or younger could be shipped, with an expanded definition of potentially higher-risk cattle parts. Japan finalized its decision to permit U.S. beef imports in December 2005 after the U.S. implemented necessary safeguards. In December 2005, Japan halted U.S. beef imports due to finding vertebral bones in veal boxes. The market reopened in July 2006 after reviewing U.S. slaughter facilities. U.S. officials aim to expand beef product eligibility under OIE guidelines, facing challenges like safety concerns, port scrutiny, and competition from Australia. Japan may impose a 50% tariff if 2008 imports exceed trigger levels. In 2008, Japan may impose a 50% tariff on U.S. beef exports if trigger levels are exceeded. Legislative initiatives in the 110th Congress depend on Japan's pace of resuming U.S. beef imports. The U.S. reopened its border to Canadian live cattle in 2005 under USDA's Minimal Risk Rule. USDA's Minimal Risk Rule 2, effective in 2007, allows for the importation of live cattle and other bovine species. The final rule allowing imports of meat from Canadian cattle older than 30 months became effective on November 19, 2007. The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockworkers of America (R-CALF USA) failed to block the border opening in court. Concerns about a flood of Canadian cull cattle exports to the United States were unlikely to occur according to USDA analysis. Factors impeding the flow of cull cattle from Canada to the United States include an increase in Canadian slaughter capacity for cull cattle. The increase in Canadian slaughter capacity for cull cattle has impeded the flow of cull cattle from Canada to the United States. Canadian cattle prices have strengthened as the MRR2 rule goes into effect, leading to concerns about competition from increased Canadian live cattle imports and potential risks associated with Canadian animals. Despite worries, some believe that following the Canada rules is necessary for the United States to demonstrate the safety of North American beef and align import policies with international standards. In the 110th Congress, resolutions of disapproval of MRR2 have been introduced in both chambers. Another bill, S. 1308, would prohibit imports of Canadian cattle over 30 months of age until mandatory country-of-origin labeling is implemented. Industry analysts believe the BSE experience has been less economically devastating in the United States compared to other countries due to implemented safeguards and less dependence on export demand. The United States is less dependent on export demand than Canada, which helped cushion the price effects of the BSE events. In 2003, the U.S. ban on Canadian beef, along with tight supplies and strong demand, drove up U.S. beef prices. Despite the BSE-related foreign bans, high demand and lower U.S. cattle inventories due to drought kept cattle and beef prices high in 2004. Average U.S. fed steer prices were nearly $85 per cwt. in 2004, compared to $85 in 2003 and $67 in 2002. Beef prices were 12 to 17 cents per pound lower in 2004 due to the loss of export markets. The loss of beef export markets in 2004 resulted in lower beef prices by 12 to 17 cents per pound. By-product prices were also affected, leading to estimated U.S. beef industry losses ranging from $3.2 to $4.7 billion."
