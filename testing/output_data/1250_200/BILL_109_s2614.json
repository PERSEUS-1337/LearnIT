    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006\". It pertains to alternative energy refueling systems. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include definitions for alternative energy refueling systems, which are used to refuel vehicles with various alternative fuels. Eligible entities are also defined in the Act. The Administrator will establish a reimbursement program for eligible entities to receive funds from the Trust Fund for purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems. Eligible entities include refueling vendors or owners/operators of facilities where these systems are located. An eligible entity seeking reimbursement for installing an alternative energy refueling system must submit an application to the Administrator. Reimbursement will be provided within 30 days of system installation and verification by the Administrator. An eligible entity cannot receive reimbursement for an alternative energy refueling system if they have already received a tax credit for it under section 30C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An eligible entity may receive reimbursement for up to 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility they own or operate. The reimbursement amount for each system cannot exceed 30% of the system cost or $30,000. This reimbursement does not affect other trust fund projects or responsibilities. The Administrator shall not use Trust Fund funds obligated for other projects or activities. This paragraph does not affect an owner or operator's obligation to comply with other provisions of this subtitle. Section 9508(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended as specified."
