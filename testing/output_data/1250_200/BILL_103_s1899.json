The Augusta Canal National Landmark in Georgia is recognized for its unspoiled areas, excellent water quality, historic landscapes, and recreational opportunities. It connects national historic districts and landmarks, offering scenic vistas and open spaces for visitors.

It played a significant role in the transformation of the area's economy and is home to various historical sites related to American Revolution, Civil War, and diverse ethnic groups. Despite efforts from various entities, the area's cultural, historical, and recreational resources have not reached their full potential and may need assistance from the Federal Government to prevent loss. The Augusta Canal National Historic Landmark is considered threatened and a priority for protection by the Secretary of the Interior. Local, regional, and State agencies, businesses, and private citizens are eager to work together to preserve and enhance the resources of the area.
