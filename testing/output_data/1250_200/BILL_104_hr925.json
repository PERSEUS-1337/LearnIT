    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise their authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" guarantees compensation for property owners if their property's value is reduced by 20% or more due to agency actions under regulatory laws. If the value diminishes by over 50%, owners can choose to sell that portion at fair market value to the Federal Government. Once compensated, the property cannot be used against the agency's limitation unless the compensation is refunded with inflation adjustments to the Treasury. SEC. 4. EFFECT OF STATE LAW. If a use is a nuisance or prohibited by local zoning, no compensation under this Act. SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS. No compensation for actions preventing hazard or damage, except for wetlands. SEC. 6. PROCEDURE. An owner seeking compensation under this Act must make a written request to the agency within 180 days of receiving notice of the agency action. The agency can negotiate the compensation amount with the owner, and if no agreement is reached within 180 days, the owner can choose arbitration or civil action. Arbitration procedures will follow those established under title 9, United States Code, and the agency must promptly pay any award to the owner. An owner seeking compensation under this Act can choose arbitration or civil action if no agreement is reached with the agency within 180 days. In arbitration, the agency must promptly pay any award to the owner, including attorney's fees and other costs. In a civil action, the owner can obtain relief and be entitled to attorney's fees, litigation costs, and interest on compensation. Payments or judgments will be made from the agency's annual appropriation, with the possibility of seeking reimbursement from another agency if required. If an agency is unable to pay compensation or satisfy a judgment, they can seek reimbursement from another agency by transferring appropriated funds. If funds are insufficient, the agency must seek additional appropriations for the next fiscal year. SEC. 7. LIMITATION. Any payment under this Act by the United States is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 8. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS. Agencies must notify property owners affected by agency actions limiting property use, explaining their rights to compensation under this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit any compensation rights under the Constitution or other U.S. laws. Compensation payment does not grant additional rights to the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms related to property, agency actions, and specified regulatory laws, including the right to use land and water, limitations on property use by agencies, and specific laws such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Endangered Species Act. The term \"fair market value\" is defined as the most probable price at which property would change hands in a competitive market between a willing buyer and seller, without compulsion to buy or sell, and with reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. This definition is outlined in the context of property rights and regulatory laws specified in the Food Security Act of 1985, Reclamation Acts, Federal Land Policy Management Act, and Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States, and the term \"law of the State\" includes the law of a political subdivision of a State. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 3, 1995. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk."
