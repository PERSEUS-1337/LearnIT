    "content": "It is a federal crime to assault, kidnap, or kill a federal judge or their family members with the intent to obstruct or retaliate for the judge's duties. The penalties are increased for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter in such cases. Other federal statutes also adopt similar penalty structures. The penalties for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter in cases involving federal judges or their family members have been increased. Other federal statutes also adopt similar penalty structures, extending protection to witnesses and potential witnesses for federal judicial, Congressional, and administrative proceedings. The penalties for murder, manslaughter, and attempted murder of federal witnesses are the same as when those crimes are committed against federal officials. Sections 205 and 206 of P.L. 110-177 increase the maximum penalty for witness tampering or retaliation involving the use of physical force. Section 204 of P.L. 110-177 increases penalties for witness tampering and retaliation, with different penalties based on the use of physical force or threat.

Additionally, federal statutes prohibit the misuse of firearms and other dangerous weapons in federal facilities, with penalties for murder, manslaughter, attempted murder, or conspiracy to murder. The penalties for possession of firearms or dangerous weapons within federal facilities are outlined in the statute, with imprisonment ranging from 1 to 5 years. Section 203 of P.L. 110-177 expands the definition of dangerous weapons to include various objects that could be misused for harm. The definition of dangerous weapons in federal courthouses may lead to practical problems if possession is considered a crime regardless of intent. There is a concern that removing the definition could create ambiguity in defining dangerous weapons. Retaliation against federal officials has included filing false liens, which can be prosecuted under federal statutes prohibiting obstruction of justice or conspiracy to inflict economic damage. Section 201 of P.L. 110-177 also makes it a federal crime to knowingly file a false lien, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Section 201 of P.L. 110-177 establishes federal crimes for filing false liens against federal officers, threatening or assaulting them or their families, intimidating witnesses, and threatening jurors.

The United States Marshals Service, located in the Department of Justice, appoints Marshals for judicial districts and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Additional funding is requested for hiring more marshals to enhance security for federal judges and prosecutors. The budget for FY2008 includes extra appropriations for investigating threats against the Judiciary and enforcing security measures. The United States Marshals Service received $25.7 million for investigating threats against the Judiciary, high-threat trial security, and judicial security in Southwest Border district offices.

Part H of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act authorizes grants for state prosecutors, including witness protection programs. Appropriations were last authorized for FY2000, with ongoing funding through 2011. Section 301 of P.L. 110-177 amends Part H to include state witness protection programs and authorizes $20 million in appropriations for each fiscal year through 2011. Sections 515 and 516 of the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968 authorize discretionary grants for correctional options. Section 2501 authorizes a matching grant program for armored vests for law enforcement officers. Section 302 of P.L. 110-177 allows for grants to improve security for court systems, with a reduction in funds for corrections alternatives. The Attorney General can require applicants to purchase armored vests for court officers.

While once binding, the guidelines are now advisory but still carry persuasive force. Appropriated funds are generally available for obligation only during the fiscal year they were appropriated, with exceptions for services spanning multiple fiscal years. The heads of executive agencies and the judicial branch have authority to enter into multi-year contracts and make advance payments on contract obligations. Section 501 of P.L. 110-177 grants the Sentencing Commission similar authority, while Section 502 eases life insurance costs for magistrate judges. Senior judges designated and assigned within the circuit have all powers except for appointing statutory positions. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the circuit Court of Appeals. The appointment authority for positions in the judicial branch is as follows: Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the circuit Court of Appeals, circuit judges appoint their own law clerks and secretaries, and circuit chief justices appoint senior staff attorneys. Magistrate judges are appointed by district court judges, who also appoint their clerks and court reporters. Only judges in \"regular active service\" can make certain decisions, such as presenting an appeal to all judges of a particular circuit. Senior judges have limitations on their powers and can only participate in en banc appeals under certain conditions. Senior judges may also serve on the Judicial Conference of the United States and judicial councils for their circuits. Section 503 of P.L. 110-177 amends 28 U.S.C. 296 to grant certain senior judges full powers of a judge, including participation in court appointments, rulemaking, and administrative matters. Magistrate judges are appointed by district court judges, with an amendment in Section 504 of P.L. 110-177 expanding this to include the Northern Mariana Islands. Section 504 of P.L. 110-177 expands the appointment of magistrate judges to include judges in regular active service and retired judges under Section 371(b) in the Northern Mariana Islands. This amendment may pose an interpretative challenge as it includes senior United States district court judges in the decision-making process. Additionally, Section 509 of P.L. 110-177 increases the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judgeships to 29 and reduces the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judgeships to 11.
