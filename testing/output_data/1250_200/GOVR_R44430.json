The Administration requested $500 million for the 21st Century Justice Initiative, a new program aimed at criminal justice reform efforts. This initiative would have focused on reducing crime, unnecessary incarceration, and building community trust through innovative approaches. States could use the funding to address various objectives in their adult and juvenile systems. States could have used funding to focus on objectives such as changing laws for shorter sentences, community policing advancements, and providing diversion and reentry services. 10% of the funding would have been dedicated to federal criminal justice reform efforts. However, Congress did not provide funding for this program."
