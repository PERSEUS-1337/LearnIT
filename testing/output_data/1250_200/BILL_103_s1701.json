    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Social Security Administration Services Preservation Act\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that the effective administration of Social Security programs depends on public goodwill and acceptance, with offices needing to be accessible to all citizens, especially the handicapped and elderly who require personal attention. Discrepancies exist in the procedures for closing, consolidating, and recategorizing Social Security Administration offices. The Act aims to ensure that decisions regarding the closure, consolidation, or recategorization of Social Security Administration offices are made in a fair and consistent manner, taking into account the interests of those affected and maintaining public confidence in the program. The Social Security Act is amended to address the consolidation, closing, or recategorization of Social Security Administration offices. The Social Security Act is amended to define terms related to office moves, including adequate public notice requirements for affected parties. The Social Security Administration defines terms related to office moves, such as 'office', 'political subdivision', and 'recategorize'. The Administration must provide 90 days public notice before closing, consolidating, or recategorizing an office, inviting written comments. Consideration must be given to the community affected by such changes. When recategorizing an office, the Social Security Administration considers the impact on the community, the need for personal service, the effect on employees, and the cost savings. The Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner must approve closing full-time offices providing a full range of services. Other determinations may be delegated by the Commissioner. The Social Security Administration may delegate determinations to close offices that offer full services. Any decision to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office must be in writing and include findings. A public hearing must be held upon request, with adequate notice, and conducted near the affected office by an official designated by the regional or central office. Within 30 days after the hearing, a final report must be issued. The Social Security Administration must issue a final report after a public hearing, specifying the status of the affected office. The report must be sent to the local press, Members of Congress, and made available to the public. Any decision to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office can be appealed to the Commissioner of Social Security within 30 days of public notice. The Commissioner will review the determination based on the record. The Commissioner will review any determination on appeal, setting aside those found to be arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by evidence. No office changes can occur during appeals, and the SSA must report closed or planned office actions annually to Congress."
