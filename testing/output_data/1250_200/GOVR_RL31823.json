    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. H.R. 2673 provided a 4.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, which was signed into law on January 23, 2004, and included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. The President issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, providing an additional pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The adjustment included an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality increase. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004. Federal white-collar employees receive an annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payment under FEPCA. The adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures. In 2003, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 18.56% if specified by FEPCA. In 2004, they also received a 4.1% adjustment, with a potential net pay increase of 15.15% if specified by FEPCA. This report focuses on the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. The President may adjust salaries of administrative law judges annually. SL and ST positions may receive the adjustment at agency heads' discretion. Contract appeals board members' adjustments depend on Executive Schedule pay. The adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with a 2.7% across-the-board pay adjustment in January 2004. The pay adjustment is effective at the start of the first pay period after January 1 each year. The President can issue an alternative plan if needed. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative plan for salary adjustments, with President Bush implementing a 1.5% pay adjustment in January 2004. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also extend to other positions. OPM clarified limitations for non-General Schedule employees in December 2001. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In 2004, blue-collar pay adjustments will not be less than GS employees in the same location. Special rate employees receive the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers get both special rates and locality pay. Employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments for GS employees to address pay disparities greater than 5%. The President can adjust payments in case of national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued a plan for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the plan. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys transitioned from the Occupational Compensation Survey Program to the National Compensation Survey program, with a phase-in of NCS survey data approved for the January 2004 locality payments. Survey results are submitted to OPM for comparison of federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) aims to reduce the pay gap between federal and non-federal salaries to 5%. Each year, OPM adjusts the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area to meet this target. FEPCA also mandates the closure of a certain percentage of the gap each year, starting at 20% in 1994 and increasing annually. However, the actual closure of the gap has been lower than the mandated percentages, with gradual progress made over the years. The pay gap reduction under FEPCA has been slow but steady, with percentages closing each year from 23.5% in 1995 to 44% in 2003. Locality rates are determined based on the target gap of 5%, using data from OCSP and NCS surveys. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps for January 2004 locality payments were determined using aged BLS survey data from various pay areas ranging from 1995 to 1996. The data was adjusted to a common reference date of March 2002 before comparing it to GS pay data. The Federal Salary Council reported a 32.02% gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries in March 2002. To reduce this disparity to 5%, an average increase of 25.73% was recommended for 2004. Locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% were suggested, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. Comparing 2003 locality payments to 2004 recommendations resulted in increases from 11.90% to 25.23% nationwide. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% average increase for 2004 to reduce the 32.02% gap between GS and non-federal salaries. Locality pay raises of 19.45% to 47.64% were suggested, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The council recommended adjustments for areas with pay gaps below RUS and to include areas with low publishability in the surveys for 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for locality pay adjustments, with exceptions for specific cases like Barnstable County, MA. The council plans to review new data before making any changes to locality pay area definitions. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for locality pay adjustments, with exceptions for specific cases like Barnstable County, MA, which is seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area due to unique circumstances. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for locality pay adjustments, with exceptions for specific cases like Barnstable County, MA. Santa Barbara County, CA, and New London, CT, are recommended to continue being included in their respective pay areas for 2004, despite falling below the employee threshold. The council plans to conduct a major review of the locality pay program in 2003 with new census data affecting future definitions. The council plans to review the locality pay program in 2003 with new census data. Monterey County, CA, is recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island is recommended to be included in the Boston pay area in 2004 under the \"Full State\" criteria. The council recommended including Monterey County, CA in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Edwards Air Force Base no longer meets employment criteria but was recommended to continue in the Los Angeles pay area. The council suggested improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent. The council's memorandum to the Pay Agent on the 2004 locality payments provided a progress report on improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program. OPM and BLS have developed new evaluation systems and models to estimate missing data, improve job matching, and provide grade level guides for occupational families. Additional improvements are anticipated in the future. BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised. Final tests of the new approach are to be conducted in the fall, with hopes of implementation in surveys by December 2003. BLS has also developed methods to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government, with these data excluded from the Pay Agent this year. The council's report on 2004 locality payments recommended the phase-in of NCS data for future improvements. The council's report on the 2004 locality payments recommended the phase-in of NCS data for future improvements, with concerns about the reliability of the data. It also suggested that additional resources should be committed by BLS to increase sample size in localities with significant pay gaps. The definition of metropolitan areas for locality pay areas changed automatically with OMB revisions, but final regulations in 2003 stated that changes would no longer occur automatically. On April 22, 2003, OPM published final regulations stating that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with new definitions of metropolitan areas. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas on June 6, 2003, based on new criteria and 2000 census data. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions for review by the Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent in 2003. Major changes considered included differences in statistical area definitions and the concept of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas'. The concept of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' used in defining locality pay areas has changed. New concepts like 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas' have been introduced. Population density is no longer a criterion, and commuting thresholds have been adjusted. A Federal Salary Council working group recommended considering the new definitions for the locality pay program, with further study needed before any decisions are made. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, acknowledging changes in demographics and criteria. They also suggested using Combined Statistical Areas for pay adjustments in January 2005, revising pay area definitions, and folding three current pay areas into RUS. Further study is needed before any decisions are made. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, suggesting revisions to pay area definitions and folding three current pay areas into RUS to save resources for surveying other areas. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and the President for January 2005 pay adjustments. In 2004, OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed upon by the House of Representatives, stating that funds cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. During the markup of the bill, an amendment was proposed by Representative Sam Farr regarding the reduction in pay for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed offered a similar amendment that was agreed to by the Senate, preventing the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This amendment was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an amendment preventing the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This provision was enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report to the President on the 2004 locality payments on December 5, 2002, recommending against allowing the locality pay increases to take effect in January 2004 due to the national emergency situation and economic slowdown. The Pay Agent recommended against allowing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to economic concerns and suggested alternative compensation approaches for Federal employees. The cost of the proposed locality-based payments would be $8.830 billion to reduce pay disparity. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation for including Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area for January 2004. The Pay Agent stated that improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, with further enhancements to be introduced in December 2003. The Pay Agent looks forward to reviewing the results of the NCS data delivered next year and mentioned that the last two improvements in NCS surveys will begin to affect data delivered in 2005. The Pay Agent encouraged expedited completion of improvements in NCS surveys for data delivery in 2005. President Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in FY2004 budget, with a required 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. If the President wants to change the annual adjustment rate, an alternative plan must be submitted to Congress by September 1, 2003. President Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in FY2004 budget, with a required 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. He submitted an alternative plan to Congress on August 27, 2003, calling for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay, costing about $2 billion. Executive Order 13322 implemented the plan, including a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. President Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in FY2004 budget, with a required 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. He submitted an alternative plan to Congress on August 27, 2003, calling for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay, costing about $2 billion. The plan included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989, with funding contingent upon OPM Director approval of a performance pay plan for an agency. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. They believed such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 eventually provided an appropriation of $1 million for the fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provided $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, with funding contingent on legislation establishing the fund within OPM. Approval from OPM and relevant subcommittees is required before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for performance pay plans. The President's alternative plan suggested a 2% pay raise, leading to concerns from federal employee union representatives. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades, allowing managers to set pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are already being implemented in various agencies. Pay parity provisions in various acts allow for salary adjustments for certain employees to be comparable to federal bank examiners. New human resources management systems for civilian employees in Homeland Security and Defense departments are authorized. Changes to pay setting systems at these agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, which may differ from the President's recommendations. In January 2000, 2002, and 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions were introduced in Congress for parity between military and civilian pay raises. Members of Congress urged support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The FY2004 budget proposed a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions on the Budget included language advocating for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the uniformed military. Congress typically includes recommendations for federal civilian pay adjustments in the Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for 2004 proposed a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, with no specific allocation between annual and locality pay adjustments. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and the House Committee on Appropriations. On July 24, 2003, the House Committee on Appropriations approved H.R. 2989 with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill was reported to the House on July 30, 2003, and passed on September 9, 2003, with a 381-39 vote. The Bush Administration opposed the 4.1% pay adjustment, proposing a 2.0% raise instead. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for all civilian employees, which is generous considering the current economic challenges. They also proposed a Human Capital Performance Fund to finance higher pay raises for high-performing federal employees. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD and Government-wide. The Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2989 expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The bill includes a 4.1% pay adjustment that exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for civilian employees, along with a Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing federal employees. However, the bill includes a 4.1% pay adjustment that exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases. The higher pay raise does not address Federal employee turnover issues, as most employees are satisfied with their pay rate and the quit rate is at an all-time low. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security could limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. The full committee approved a 4.1% pay adjustment bill on September 4, 2003, and reported it to the Senate on September 8, 2003. Section 636 and Section 502 of the bill provide for the pay increase to be absorbed within appropriated levels. The Senate passed the bill with the pay adjustment on October 23, 2003. On October 23, 2003, the Senate passed a 4.1% pay adjustment bill for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The adjustment is effective as of the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, and is to be funded within appropriated levels. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which became P.L. 108-199, providing a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. The pay provisions are at Section 640(a) and Section 502 of the law. The cost of the 4.1% pay adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion dollars, with revised salary tables for 2004 available on OPM's website. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations were also included. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355, Federal White-Collar Pay: FY2005 Salary Adjustments. FEPCA aims to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. However, only a small percentage of the target pay gaps has been closed each year, leading to a continued pay disparity. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report that the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries averages 25.73% for 2004. Concerns have been raised about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Despite these concerns, no proposals were made to change FEPCA, and the methodology remains a concern due to issues with data completeness and credibility. Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys documenting non-federal rates of pay were not approved for use in determining locality payments for several years, leading to the use of aged survey data. In 2001, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to address concerns with the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments. The Pay Agent reported to Congress in 2001 and highlighted methodological concerns. Improvements to the survey methodology were discussed, and in 2002, the Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. The comparison showed that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts, with about 85 percent lagging behind by more than 20 percent. In contrast, about 30 percent of federal employees in technical and clerical occupations had salaries higher than those in the private sector. The analysis revealed a concern that the federal pay system does not allow for variation in pay raises by occupation, potentially leading to smaller pay raises for employees in certain occupations. The Congressional Budget Office found that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations earn less than their private sector counterparts, while those in technical and clerical occupations earn more. The current federal pay system fails to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs, with some occupational groups receiving above-market salaries and others below-market salaries. Implementing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) fully would not address the pay disparity issue, especially as the cost of locality-based comparability payments is a concern. Pay Agent estimated that the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would cost $8.830 billion to reduce the pay disparity to 5% as required by FEPCA. AFGE and NTEU endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal as inadequate. AFGE questions the methodology issues in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector, particularly regarding the locality and Employment Cost Index components. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to economic concerns, locality pay increases were not implemented as per Executive Order 13322 by President Bush. In January 2004, U.S. President Bush issued Executive Order 13322 for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. Another Executive Order 13332 in March 2004 provided an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. The pay rates for 2004 were calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online. MSA refers to Metropolitan Statistical Area and CMSA refers to Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area."
