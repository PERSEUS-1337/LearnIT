    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fern Lake Conservation and Recreation Act of 2001\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The Congress finds that Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed in Bell County, Kentucky, and Claiborne County, Tennessee, are potential additions to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. Acquiring Fern Lake and its watershed would protect the vista from Pinnacle Overlook, enhance recreational opportunities, and safeguard the water supply for Middlesboro, Kentucky. The 4,500-acre watershed is privately owned, with the lake and part of the watershed currently for sale. However, the Secretary of the Interior is unable to use appropriated funds for acquisition due to legal restrictions. The Act of June 11, 1940 prohibits using appropriated funds to acquire Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed. The Act aims to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to use funds to acquire the area from willing sellers to protect scenic and natural resources at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and ensure a safe water supply for Middlesboro, Kentucky. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed from willing sellers to protect scenic and natural resources at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and ensure a safe water supply for Middlesboro, Kentucky. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire approximately 4,500 acres of land, including Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed, for addition to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. The map depicting the boundary addition is dated May 2001 and will be on file with the National Park Service. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire land for Cumberland Gap National Historical Park through donation, purchase, or exchange with owner consent. The Secretary will adjust park boundaries upon land acquisition and manage Fern Lake for water quality protection. The Secretary will manage public recreational use of Fern Lake to protect its water quality. If the land acquisition includes the lake's water supply, contracts may be entered into for the sale of water to the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky. Proceeds from the water sale will be available for park expenditure without further appropriation. Consultation requirements will be met to better manage Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed. The Secretary will consult with officials and organizations from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, as well as other interested parties, to facilitate water provision for municipal needs and promote new recreational opportunities at Fern Lake."
