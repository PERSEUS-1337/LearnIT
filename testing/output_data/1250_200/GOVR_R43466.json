These medications are prescribed to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring the use of psychotropic medications in foster children, and federal law requires states to have a plan for overseeing their use. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of child abuse or neglect, leading to some children being placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. Judges determine the necessity of removal from homes deemed harmful to the child's welfare. Most children enter foster care due to neglect or abuse. The judge has given responsibility for the child's care and placement to the state child welfare agency. Foster care is a temporary placement for children who have experienced neglect, abuse, or behavioral problems. States work to find permanent homes for children in foster care while ensuring their safety and well-being. In FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system and 428,000 remaining in care. The national foster care caseload has been declining, with about 77,000 fewer children in care on the last day of FY2015 compared to previous years. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, impacting their socialization and behavior. A national survey found that 43%-46% of children in foster care were at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, requiring mental health services. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a significantly higher risk of behavioral or emotional problems compared to the general population. Rates of 61%-70% were found among this group, much higher than the 7% to 11% in the general population. Medicaid-eligible foster care children are increasingly diagnosed with mental health issues like attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Nearly all foster care children are eligible for Medicaid-funded health care services. Title XIX of the Social Security Act discusses the increase in mental health diagnoses among children in foster care from 2002 to 2007. The most common diagnoses varied by age group, with older children more likely to be diagnosed with certain conditions. Rates of major mental health diagnoses by age group showed an increase across all diagnoses, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia among both age groups. National standards for mental health care have been developed for children in foster care. National standards propose mental health screening and assessment for children in foster care, with Medicaid providing diagnostic and treatment services. States design their Medicaid plans for medical assistance, including mental health services, for eligible children in foster care. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and entitled to EPSDT program benefits, including health screenings, assessments, immunizations, and mental health services. States must provide treatment for identified health needs, including behavioral health services. Medicaid financing covers services by psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment, such as counseling and case management from mental health professionals. Certain interventions like behavioral therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been found to be effective for children with disruptive behaviors. Additionally, activities like anger management and social skills training can help children who have experienced trauma. A medical professional may prescribe psychotropic medications to meet children's behavioral health needs. Children in foster care may be prescribed psychotropic medications when psychosocial treatment alone is ineffective. This may occur due to a lack of resources for comprehensive mental health care. The over-reliance on medication for these children reflects a need for better access to evidence-based psychosocial therapies. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to children with mental health needs who remain in their own homes following investigations of abuse or neglect. Research shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children taking antipsychotic medication, highlighting the need for better access to evidence-based therapies. Studies have shown that children in foster care with mental health needs often do not receive necessary services. A national survey from 2008 to 2010 revealed that 3 out of 10 children in foster care did not receive specialty mental health services or psychotropics, while 9% received psychotropics without services. Rates of psychotropic medication use among foster children are significantly higher than the general population, with Medicaid-eligible foster children receiving medication at a much higher rate. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at a higher rate compared to other children served by Medicaid, similar to older children with mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Research shows that children in non-relative foster homes are not more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medication compared to those living in their own homes. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system, including foster care, vary by state and over time. The study found variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility from 2002 to 2007. There was an increase in antipsychotic medication use across most states during this period, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 21.7% in 2007. The annual rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care varied among states, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 21.7% in 2007. A review of Medicaid claims data from 20 states showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 to 2009. Data from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) provided a detailed discussion on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. NSCAW II examined outcomes of 5,872 children in contact with child welfare system due to abuse/neglect. Survey included children in homes post-investigation and those in foster care. Ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-ups. Children not necessarily in foster care for entire period. At the 36-month follow-up, children in the NSCAW II study showed that those in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents post-investigation. Children in congregate care and school-age in foster care had higher chances of using psychotropic medications. There was a significant increase in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care at 18 months post-investigation compared to those who remained in their homes. At the 36-month follow-up of the NSCAW II study, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to those living with their own parents post-investigation. Among children in foster care, those in group settings had the highest prevalence of psychotropic medication use, especially within the first six months of placement. At 18 months after the initial investigation of child abuse or neglect, children in group settings were most likely to be prescribed psychotropics (67.4%), followed by children in other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), those who remained in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). The trend continued at 36 months, with over half of children in group settings taking psychotropics (52%). Children in group homes or residential settings were also more likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking multiple psychotropic medications, with about half of them (48.6%) prescribed two or more drugs. At 36 months after the initial investigation, 40% of children in group settings were taking two or more psychotropic medications, compared to children in other settings. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics, followed by youth ages 6 to 10 and youth ages 18 and older. The research found that youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropic medications, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. The oldest youth, ages 18 and older, were less likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 through 17. The prescribing patterns for foster children have been characterized as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" with polypharmacy rates remaining consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually from 2002 to 2007. Data from the NSCAW II study shows that children in foster care were prescribed an average of 1.9 psychotropic medications per child. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple antipsychotic medications, as it can lead to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Prescriptions for foster children exceeding recommended dosages are particularly concerning due to limited research on the safety and efficacy of these medications for children. Health experts have raised concerns about the overprescription of psychotropic medications to very young foster children, with studies showing that children under the age of 6 in out-of-home care are being prescribed these drugs at higher rates compared to those not in foster care. Research also indicates an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with each year of age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care, despite the lack of established mental health indications for such use in infants. Health experts have raised concerns about the overprescription of psychotropic medications to very young foster children, with studies showing higher rates of prescription for children under 6 in out-of-home care. The use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children can lead to serious health effects, although children in foster care may benefit from them due to greater mental health service needs. However, psychotropic medications may not always be effective in treating mental health needs, and the lack of psychosocial services could contribute to increased use of these drugs. The prescribing rate of certain classes of psychotropics, such as antipsychotics, has been steadily growing, particularly for off-label treatment of bipolar disorders and schizophrenia in children. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has been increasing. This trend is attributed to factors such as limited research on their efficacy in children, pharmaceutical companies marketing these drugs, and a rise in prescriptions for psychotropic medications in general. Concerns have been raised about the safety and effectiveness of these medications, particularly antipsychotics, for children with mental health disorders. Research on the safety of antipsychotics in children has shown insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Research on the safety of antipsychotics in children, including those in foster care, has shown insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Studies have highlighted concerns such as high risk of bias, harmful health outcomes like high cholesterol and weight gain, and inadequate study durations to evaluate long-term effects. Despite these issues, some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing mental health symptoms. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma. Stimulants, particularly for ADHD, have been well researched and found to effectively reduce core symptoms. Children in foster care are more likely to have a mental health diagnosis, and higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate due to the increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions in this population. Levels of psychotropic drug use in foster care may be influenced by multiple placements and inconsistent state oversight practices. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medication use for children in foster care, including holding hearings on clinical drug trials. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for the well-being of children in foster care. The 2008 Fostering Connections Act expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to ensure health and well-being of children in foster care, including oversight of prescribed medications. The 2008 Fostering Connections Act expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to ensure the health and well-being of children in foster care, including oversight of prescribed medications, such as psychotropic medication. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act further stipulated that states must have protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. A study by the Government Accountability Office reviewed state policies on prescribing psychotropic medications in six states, comparing them against best practice guidelines developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed best practice guidelines for oversight of psychotropic medications in foster care. Six state programs were found to fall short of comprehensive oversight, with only Texas fully implementing consent procedures. Lack of adherence to AACAP guidelines may lead to caregivers not fully understanding risks and benefits. GAO recommended HHS endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed increasing cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs. The role of HHS and state Medicaid programs in improving cooperation and communication was discussed, with a focus on increasing guidance for best practices in overseeing psychotropic medication. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications, emphasizing the importance of therapy. The Senate Finance Committee also held a roundtable to address issues related to psychotropic medication for children in foster care, with some youths highlighting the benefits of therapy in transitioning from medication. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses discussed the prevalence of medication use, alternatives, tools for prescribing, and the roles of schools, mental health system, and foster parents. Dr. Phil McGraw was among the witnesses advocating for greater awareness on the issue. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) presented findings from their work between 2011 to 2014, focusing on prescribing rates and documentation quality. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication use. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication use for children in foster care, particularly regarding psychotropic medication. State agencies have developed practices for better mental health diagnosis and treatment, including initial screenings and monitoring of children on medication. Third-party managed care organizations have not been addressed in the oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster children. State agencies in seven states have developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting the use of psychosocial services for children in foster care. Strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, along with state outreach to stakeholders, was crucial for implementing oversight practices. State officials use various measures to assess the effectiveness of their efforts, including reviewing physician prescribing practices, state oversight practices, and monitoring child outcomes. The GAO did not evaluate the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. The GAO recommended that HHS convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight for children in care. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use and promoted interagency cooperation to develop alternative strategies for children with mental health needs. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children with mental health needs. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This plan must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, in consultation with health care experts and child welfare services recipients. The strategy must include a schedule for initial and follow-up health screenings meeting medical practice standards. The coordinated strategy for child welfare services must include a schedule for initial and follow-up health screenings, monitoring and treating health needs, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, consulting with medical professionals, and developing transition plans for children aging out of foster care. The federal child welfare law requires state agencies to have written plans for children in foster care, including health-related records such as immunizations, medication information, and health provider details. These records must be updated and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement, and to youth upon aging out of care. States report on oversight of psychotropic medications through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports for federal funding. The APSRs are required annually for jurisdictions seeking federal funds for child welfare programs. State oversight protocols must address screening, evaluation, consent to treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. The CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 required reporting on the oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for psychotropic medications. HHS convened a working group in 2011 to address research on psychotropic medication use among children. In 2011, HHS formed a working group to address the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. The group aimed to expand evidence-based screening and interventions, enhance oversight of medications, and increase research on medications and psychosocial treatments for these children. The group, led by the Administration for Children and Families, includes representatives from other HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA, which provide funding and support for services such as therapy, case management, and prescription drugs. SAMHSA administers block grant funding to support non-Medicaid covered treatment services for children with complex trauma needs. In 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing the effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care, emphasizing collaboration between state child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities. In response to the need for improved health outcomes, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS collaborated to provide guidance on monitoring psychotropic medication use among children in foster care through webinars and information sessions. They also convened state directors in August 2012 to address the use of psychotropic medications and mental health needs of children in foster care. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit aimed to enhance collaboration among state leaders in child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies regarding the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. States were asked to outline steps for improvement, activities to meet goals, challenges, partners, and a timeline for implementation. HHS provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use in April 2012. HHS provided guidance to child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use, emphasizing coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. ACF also issued guidance on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development and social-emotional well-being. Additionally, ACF published guides for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and for child welfare staff. ACF has published guides for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and for child welfare staff on mental health issues, trauma impact, and psychotropic medications. ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental health needs. SAMHSA provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. SAMHSA funds a medical director position to work with child and adolescent psychiatrists on psychotropic medication issues. The network disseminates best practices through a listerv and webinars, including for children on Medicaid. CMS issued a bulletin in 2012 to address psychotropic medication use in vulnerable populations, requiring Drug Utilization Review programs for oversight. Some states use automated system checks to ensure prescriptions align with medical standards. In 2015, CMS collaborated with state Medicaid agencies to improve appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. CMS also introduced a new measure to help states enhance healthcare delivery for children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Joint guidance from CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA in 2013 emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma\". The 2013 guidance emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma\" and highlighted the use of functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed further support for these interventions. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being. This would involve providing performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies totaling $500 million over five years. States could also apply for competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to implement alternative psychosocial interventions. The research literature has focused on states overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care, including obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to learn about state policies related to oversight of psychotropic medications, but none address how states have responded to the federal provision added in 2011. Researchers surveyed 48 states and the District of Columbia to assess policies on overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children. Over half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. At the time of the survey, 26 states had a policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had none. Some states used \"red flag\" markers to identify problems with medication use. Researchers found that states had various red flags to identify concerning psychotropic drug use in foster care children, such as medication use in young children, multiple medications before a single one, concurrent use of multiple psychotropic medications, prolonged use of multiple medications within the same class, and exceeding recommended dosages. However, there was little systematic implementation or study of these approaches to improve outcomes. Recent concerns have been raised about the lack of policies and procedures addressing psychotropic medication use, with a 2014 study revealing underdeveloped policies in 16 states. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with some policies being underdeveloped. Collaborative efforts have been made to improve oversight, such as the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative involving state agencies. The Center for Health Care Strategies, in collaboration with state health and Medicaid agencies, developed common terms and measures for monitoring psychotropic medication use among foster youth. States have implemented protocols for gaining consent, real-time data collection, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailored monitoring processes. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing found high rates of psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect. The study looked at psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect by a child welfare agency. Data was collected at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months after the investigation. The analysis included children in foster care and those living at home with their biological or adoptive parents. The study analyzed psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect by a child welfare agency. Data was collected at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months after the investigation. Children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medications compared to those living at home. Statistical significance was found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up for children in foster care. At the 18-month follow-up, statistical significance was found between care groups for children ages 11 through 17 years, but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. Differences between in-home and foster care groups were significant at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, with no statistical significance at the initial survey."
