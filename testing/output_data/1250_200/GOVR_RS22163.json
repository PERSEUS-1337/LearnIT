    "content": "The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, shared goals, and overlapping interests. Both sides face challenges like economic concerns, terrorism, and armed conflict. Close cooperation is essential as neither can address global issues alone. The relationship includes a significant trade and investment partnership. The U.S. Congress frequently deals with issues that have a European dimension, such as economic and security matters. The U.S. Congress engages with European legislators on economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Members consider the dynamics of U.S.-European cooperation and have historically supported a close transatlantic relationship. Congressional interest in Europe is driven by the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges. The U.S. Congress has historically supported a close transatlantic relationship with Europe, driven by the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges. The institutional pillars of NATO and the EU have been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe, with the relationship between the United States and the EU growing in significance. The EU and NATO play key roles in decision-making and security in Europe. The EU focuses on common policies in various areas, while NATO remains the primary security institution. The US Congress maintains a strong interest in NATO, which has evolved since the Cold War. Recent discussions within NATO have been influenced by the conflict in Ukraine and relations with Russia. Leadership transitions occurred in 2014 for Euro-Atlantic institutions. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Key figures like Martin Schulz, Jens Stoltenberg, Jean-Claude Juncker, Federica Mogherini, and Donald Tusk took on new roles. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration remained relatively favorable. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration have been positive compared to the Bush years. Transatlantic relations have been constructive, but challenges have led to frustrations. Concerns arose when the U.S. announced a shift towards Asia, causing anxiety in Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has prompted a reassessment of European security, with the U.S. maintaining a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The U.S. is expected to focus on Asia and the Middle East, while also engaging with Europe. Europe is expected to share the burden of its own security and take a leading role in regional and international issues. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties, defense spending, and common foreign policy coherence. The EU faces complex political dynamics and challenges following the financial crisis. The debt crisis post-2008 global downturn exposed the EU's unfinished nature, leading to tensions among member states. Anti-establishment sentiment is rising, with populist parties advocating nationalist and anti-EU policies gaining strength. These parties oppose further integration and the euro currency. The rise of Euro-skeptic parties, both far-right and far-left, has been evident in European politics, with significant wins in the 2014 European Parliament election and the 2015 Greek elections. This trend will continue to be tested in national elections across Europe, including the UK, where a possible referendum on EU membership looms. The deteriorating relations with Russia following the crisis in Ukraine have also impacted US and European policy makers. The crisis and conflict in Ukraine have transformed Russia from a \"strategic partner\" to a \"strategic problem\" for U.S. and European policy makers. Despite some advocating for cooperation with Russia, recent actions have strained relations. Tensions between Russia and the West have been ongoing for over a decade, with points of contention such as NATO enlargement and conflicts with Georgia. The Obama Administration attempted to improve relations through initiatives like the New START treaty, but objections remained regarding Russia's policies. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe with Russia escalated due to disagreements over various issues, including Russia's actions in Georgia, the CFE Treaty, and the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. Russia's support for Assad in Syria and opposition to NATO's operation in Libya further strained relations. The political crisis in Ukraine from late 2013 onwards marked a turning point in U.S. and European perceptions of Russia. The political crisis in Ukraine in late 2013 led to U.S. and European support for a new pro-Western government after President Yanukovych was ousted. Russian forces then annexed Crimea in February-March 2014, citing historical ties and protecting its inhabitants. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was justified as rectifying a historical transfer, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population. The annexation and referendum are not recognized internationally, leading to sanctions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 has resulted in over 4,300 deaths, with evidence of Russian military involvement. The United States and Western governments believe Russian military units are directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, providing material support to separatists. Despite Russia's denial, U.S. and European coordination on sanctions has been strong, especially after the downing of flight MH17 in 2014. EU expanded sanctions on Russia's economy following the incident. The EU has expanded sanctions on Russia's economy beyond individuals and specific entities to target wider sectors. European countries have strong economic ties with Russia, leading to debates over the effectiveness of sanctions. Despite some skepticism, all 28 EU member states have unanimously agreed on the sanctions, viewing them as a political imperative to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine. The EU reviews its sanctions package monthly, requiring unanimous consensus to overturn it. The EU sanctions on Russia, seen as a political imperative, require unanimous consensus for renewal. Russia's economy has been affected by recession, weakened ruble, and high inflation, partly due to low oil prices and Western sanctions. Speculation on Russia's next moves in eastern Ukraine varies from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. EU High Representative Mogherini supports the sanctions. The EU sanctions on Russia, requiring unanimous consensus for renewal, have affected Russia's economy. Speculation on Russia's next moves in eastern Ukraine varies. In January 2015, EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with ceasefire agreement. U.S. and European relations with Russia expected to remain a central topic. Members of Congress may engage in adopting additional sanctions or deterrents. Cooperation with European counterparts may be considered. Members of Congress may cooperate with European counterparts to align policies and support Ukraine. The US provided significant aid to Ukraine in 2014 and passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in 2014. The EU has also provided substantial financial support to Ukraine. The Administration has not provided lethal aid to Ukraine yet. The EU has signed an Association Agreement with Ukraine and plans to provide over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans from European financial institutions between 2014 and 2020. International financial assistance for Ukraine is tied to economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts. Developments in Ukraine have sparked debates about NATO's future and influenced U.S. views on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense, prompting European countries to increase defense spending and military capabilities. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security in response to Russian aggression. The Obama Administration has implemented the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in response to Russian aggression, providing $810 million for troop rotations and military equipment in Eastern Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe under ERI is rotational, with no plans for permanent increases. Despite plans to close 15 bases in Europe, the overall U.S. force level is expected to remain around 67,000 personnel. Debates about NATO's future were expected to focus on long-term issues before the crisis in Ukraine. The U.S. force level in Europe is expected to stay at around 67,000 personnel. Concerns exist about declining European defense budgets and a growing military capabilities gap within NATO. European militaries lack important capabilities like air- and sealift, aerial refueling, and intelligence. Efforts for European defense integration have had limited success. NATO's relevance is seen to depend on its ability to conduct out-of-area operations and address unconventional threats. The 2010 NATO summit adopted the latest Strategic Concept, which outlines three core tasks for NATO: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. The alliance is urged to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and address unconventional security challenges like terrorism and cybersecurity. However, analysts fear public opposition, political will, and resource shortages may hinder these efforts. In the aftermath of Afghanistan, analysts believe Europe may be less willing to engage in large-scale missions overseas due to public opposition, political will, and resource shortages. Security outlook in Europe has shifted with increased concerns about the threat from Russia, leading to calls for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces in countries like Poland and the Baltic states. NATO's response includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security in the region, such as tripling fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. The 28 NATO member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the Cold War. The plan includes measures in Central and Eastern Europe like enhanced infrastructure, pre-positioning of equipment, and a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers. Allies also pledged to halt declining defense expenditures and work towards spending 2% of national GDP on defense. Tensions between the EU and Russia have refocused attention on European energy security. Europe's energy security is a major concern due to its heavy reliance on Russian gas imports. Moscow has used energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure. Concerns over potential gas cutoffs, like those seen in past Russia-Ukraine disputes, have heightened tensions. The United States has expressed concerns about European energy security due to reliance on Russian natural gas. Efforts to reduce dependence on Russia through diversification of supply and development of alternative sources face challenges, such as political instability in North Africa and Russia's opposition to alternative pipelines. European energy security has been dependent on new pipelines, with Russia hindering alternative pipelines. European countries focus on renewable energy, but doubts remain on its impact. Leaders aim for a common energy strategy, liberalizing the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have spurred urgency. Countries have built LNG terminals, expanded pipeline connections, and developed gas flow reversal capabilities. Prime Minister Tusk proposed an EU \"energy union\" in 2014. In April 2014, Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed an EU \"energy union\" to centralize natural gas purchasing for all 28 members. This union would also include solidarity mechanisms for supply disruptions. Legislation was already in place to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector, which Russia criticized. Russia canceled the South Stream pipeline project in December 2014, seen as a response to EU obstacles. Russia canceled the South Stream pipeline project in December 2014, possibly due to frustration with EU obstacles and criticism over actions in Ukraine. They are now focusing on diversifying markets by partnering with China and Turkey. The US and Europe are jointly combating the Islamic State through military action and financial targeting. NATO members have participated in coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq. European countries, including NATO members Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have provided support in the form of coalition airstrikes, trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid to Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq. However, European military action against the Islamic State has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. The EU, alongside the United States, has condemned the Assad government in Syria and imposed sanctions, but stronger U.N. action has been blocked by Russia and China. The EU imposed sanctions on the Assad government's economic base and recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. European countries provided non-lethal support to Syrian rebel forces and expressed concerns about terrorism after the 2015 Paris attacks. Authorities conducted raids to dismantle an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium. Concerns about \"foreign fighters\" joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq have been raised, with estimates suggesting thousands of European citizens may be involved. Recent estimates from Europol suggest that there may be 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from significant EU countries and other Western nations involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Authorities are concerned about the potential for these fighters to return home with extremist views and skills to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe. European governments are implementing security measures such as increased surveillance and prohibiting travel to address these threats. Authorities in EU countries have taken various measures to prevent individuals from traveling to Syria, including arrests, passport confiscations, and detentions of returning fighters. However, challenges remain in tracking European fighters and coordinating a unified approach due to differing views on issues such as intelligence-sharing and civil liberties. The Paris attacks have prompted new debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers within the EU, especially considering the open internal borders. The Paris attacks have sparked debates on enhancing security within the EU, including the proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11, with agreements on extradition, legal assistance, container security, and sharing airline passenger data. The US and EU collaborate on tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" The EU and US collaborate on counterterrorism by sharing financial data through the \"SWIFT agreement\" and bilateral intelligence sharing. However, concerns exist over data privacy safeguards in information-sharing arrangements, causing delays in agreements like the SWIFT deal and sharing airline passenger data. The EU and US have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement since 2011, aligning their lists of terrorist organizations. In 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, urged by the US. However, critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient. In 2014, the EU General Court ruled to remove Hamas from the terrorist list due to procedural grounds. The EU General Court ruled to remove Hamas from the terrorist list on procedural grounds related to the decision-making process. The EU External Action Service stated that the decision was not political and sanctions against Hamas will remain in place during the appeal process. The US and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas. Europe has been closely involved in international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program, with transatlantic cooperation playing a key role. The EU has shown a willingness to impose sanctions on Iran independently of the UN, aligning with US sanctions. This includes an oil embargo, restrictions on nuclear technology, arms embargo, and financial restrictions. Over 100 individuals and 480 entities linked to Iran's nuclear program are under visa bans and asset freezes. Following concerted sanctions by the US, EU, and other international partners, over 100 individuals and 480 entities involved in Iran's nuclear program faced asset freezes. Tensions eased after Hassan Rouhani's election in 2013, leading to the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. The JPA required Iran to freeze some nuclear activities and cooperate with monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief, including allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million monthly from oil sales and suspending certain trade restrictions. Iran is set to repatriate $700 million per month from oil sales, with the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) terms extended twice. Negotiators aim to reach a final deal, but obstacles remain. Concerns persist about Iran's nuclear ambitions and regional influence. The EU opposes new U.S. sanctions, fearing they could jeopardize talks and fracture the international coalition. The United States and the European Union, along with Russia and the United Nations Secretary-General's office, are members of the diplomatic quartet that has attempted to mediate a negotiated political settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. European officials advocate a \"two-state\" solution for a sustainable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Recent talks in April 2014 were unsuccessful, and prospects for a near-term settlement appear remote due to conflicts and unilateral actions by Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Israeli concerns about international \"isolation\" have been fueled by developments in Europe's approach to the issue. Israeli concerns about international \"isolation\" have been fueled by European support for Palestinians, including Sweden's recognition of a Palestinian state and non-binding resolutions from other European countries. Israel is also worried about reduced economic cooperation with the EU and potential International Criminal Court investigations. European recognition of Palestinian statehood, potential International Criminal Court investigations of Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza, and expected efforts by Palestinians and Arab states to propose another U.N. Security Council resolution. The EU has restricted funding to Israeli organizations in certain settlements, with discussions about labeling settlement products. Analysts believe these measures do not pose a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. The EU aims to motivate peace talks rather than impose sanctions, offering financial incentives and upgraded ties in case of successful peace negotiations. The EU may offer financial incentives and upgraded ties to Israel and Palestinians for a successful peace agreement. The US and EU have a significant trade relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and providing millions of jobs. Merchandise trade totaled $787 billion in 2013, with US and European companies being major investors in each other's markets. The transatlantic economic relationship is influential in shaping global standards. The transatlantic economic relationship between the US and EU is highly influential in shaping global standards. Efforts to liberalize world trade have been driven by their cooperation, with ongoing negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aiming to boost jobs and growth by reducing trade barriers and harmonizing regulations. Proponents believe this agreement could allow the US and EU to define global standards, rather than other countries like China. The TTIP has become central to the U.S.-EU political relationship as a way to reaffirm the transatlantic relationship. There is a risk of wider fallout if negotiations fail or the agreement falls short of expectations. U.S. and EU officials aim to initial a draft agreement by the end of 2015, but critics have raised objections, particularly regarding investor-state dispute settlement provisions. European opposition to TTIP has increased, with concerns about limiting the EU's regulatory abilities. Critics in Europe are concerned that including the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in TTIP could limit the EU's regulatory abilities. There are also worries about the impact of TTIP on data privacy, food labeling, and geographic protections for items like Champagne and Black Forest ham. In the U.S., Congress is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to facilitate trade negotiations. The Eurozone crisis dominated European politics from 2010 to 2012, raising doubts about the sustainability of the monetary union without fiscal union. The Eurozone crisis from 2010 to 2012 led to unprecedented steps by EU leaders to address the monetary union's structural flaws. Despite improved market confidence, doubts remain about the crisis being definitively over. Many analysts doubt that the Eurozone crisis is definitively over, citing concerns about national austerity efforts, low growth, and high unemployment. Economic forecasts predict modest growth in 2015, with unemployment rates expected to remain high. The potential stand-off between the EU and Greece over austerity terms also raises concerns. The ECB announced a massive stimulus program to address economic stagnation fears. The U.S. economy continued to grow despite Eurozone crisis concerns. Congress worried about the impact on U.S. and global economies. NSA surveillance programs in the U.S. and Europe strained transatlantic relations. Concerns arose over spying on EU offices and German Chancellor Merkel's phone. The NSA and UK's Government Communications Headquarters conducted surveillance operations raising concerns about U.S. surveillance, European involvement, and the balance between security and privacy rights. European leaders and citizens were dismayed by potential privacy violations and security compromises. Criticism was strongest in Germany due to the broad scope of NSA activities and historical context of government surveillance. Fallout from the reports could impact U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data sharing. The fallout from reports of domestic spying by the Nazi and East German regimes could affect U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. The European Parliament has raised concerns about U.S. surveillance activities and called for the suspension of certain agreements. Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. The fallout from reports of domestic spying by the Nazi and East German regimes could affect U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. European leaders' outrage may be for domestic consumption, but cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence services continues despite political trust issues. The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has led to increased human activities in the region, with the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage expected to become increasingly ice-free. The Arctic Council, consisting of eight countries with territory in the Arctic Circle, addresses various issues such as regional development, emergency response, and natural resource extraction. The United States will take over the chairmanship in 2015, with a focus on cooperation in the Arctic region. The melting Arctic ice is opening up sea routes, potentially reducing costs for commercial ships and increasing human activities, which may lead to environmental risks. The Arctic Council, consisting of eight countries, including the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, focuses on regional development and natural resource extraction. While the Council does not address security issues, the Arctic is seen as geopolitically significant. Some members, including Russia, have expressed intentions to establish a military presence in the region. Concerns over tensions in Ukraine potentially affecting Arctic cooperation have been raised. China has also shown interest in the Arctic region. China, along with other observer countries, has shown interest in the Arctic region. The EU was denied full observer status due to objections by Canadian Inuits. In 2014, Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr. was appointed as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic, leading the 2015-2017 U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council with a focus on stewardship, climate change, and governance of the Arctic Ocean. U.S. priorities in the Arctic include stewardship, governance of the Arctic Ocean, climate change mitigation, and economic issues with the Arctic Economic Council."
