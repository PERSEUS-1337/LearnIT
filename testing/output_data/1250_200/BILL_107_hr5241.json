    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities, including children with special needs and those living with relatives due to parental incapacity. Additionally, a significant portion of the elderly population experiences multiple disabling conditions. Approximately 25% of the Nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Around 600,000 Americans die at home annually, often relying on extensive family caregiving. 42% of individuals needing daily assistance in the US are under 65. Family caregivers face emotional, physical, and financial challenges, with insufficient resources to replace them with paid workers. The cost of replacing family caregivers with paid services would be around $200 billion yearly. 75% of family caregivers are women, and many struggle to find information on available respite care. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish State and local lifespan respite care programs, improve and coordinate the dissemination of respite care information and resources to family caregivers, provide, supplement, or improve respite care services to family caregivers, and promote innovative approaches to the delivery of respite care and recruitment of respite care workers and volunteers. The purpose of this section is to support innovative approaches in respite care delivery, recruitment and training of workers and volunteers, and training programs for family caregivers to make informed decisions about respite care services. It also aims to fund evaluative research to identify effective respite care services and promote the dissemination of results and findings from related programs and research projects. The purpose of this section is to define key terms related to respite care services. The curr_chunk defines the term 'condition' to include various health and developmental issues, while 'eligible recipient' refers to entities capable of providing respite care services. The term 'eligible recipient' includes State agencies, public entities, nonprofit organizations, political subdivisions with a population of at least 3,000,000, and recognized State respite coordinating agencies with specific capabilities. The term 'family caregiver' refers to unpaid family members, foster parents, or other unpaid individuals. The term 'family caregiver' includes unpaid family members, foster parents, or other unpaid adults providing in-home care for individuals with special needs. Lifespan respite care is a system of community-based services for family caregivers regardless of age, race, or special need. Respite care offers temporary relief to family caregivers or emergency care when they are unable to provide it. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 'Special need' pertains to the specific requirements of individuals of any age who need care due to a condition to meet basic needs or prevent harm. \"SEC. 2803. LIFESPAN RESPITE CARE GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.\" The section aims to expand respite care services for family caregivers, improve dissemination and coordination, and enhance access and quality of care to reduce caregiver strain. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible recipients for this purpose. Coordination of respite care services across different agencies is emphasized to support caregivers of individuals with special needs. Application procedures are outlined for potential recipients. The Health Services Administration coordinates respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs. Eligible recipients must submit an application outlining their understanding of respite care, capacity for family involvement, and collaboration with other agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for agencies providing respite care services to family caregivers, including details on the population served, respite care needs, existing services, coordination methods, and information dissemination. The curr_chunk outlines the plan for respite care services, including information dissemination, collaboration with other services, and population served. The plan for respite care services includes involving the population in planning, maximizing use of available funds, improving coordination of services, and identifying criteria for family caregivers. The respite care services plan includes criteria for identifying eligible family caregivers, monitoring quality and safety of services, evaluating expected results, and maintaining confidentiality of caregiver records. The Secretary will establish a panel to review and evaluate applications for respite care services, making recommendations for approval. Grants or cooperative agreements will be awarded based on the panel's recommendations, with priority given to approved applications. The Secretary will prioritize applicants showing the greatest likelihood of implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide when awarding grants or cooperative agreements. Recipients must agree to use funds for developing respite care at state and local levels, providing services to meet unmet needs, and evaluating effectiveness. The Secretary awards grants for developing respite care services, with a maximum term of 5 years. Recipients can subcontract with public or nonprofit agencies. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other available funds for respite care. The Secretary will award a grant to establish a National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care. The Center's duties include maintaining a national database, providing training and assistance to respite care programs, and offering information and educational programs to the public. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out these activities."
