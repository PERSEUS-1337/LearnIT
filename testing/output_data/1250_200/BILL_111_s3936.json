    "content": "The \"States as Energy Leaders for the Future Act\" or \"SELF Act\" defines terms like \"eligible entity\" and \"Secretary\" for the Clean Energy Grant Program. The Department of Energy establishes a program to provide grants to eligible entities for clean energy and carbon reduction measures, including renewable electricity standards, climate action plans, use of alternative vehicles, energy efficiency standards for public buildings, participation in greenhouse gas reduction programs, and financing for energy efficiency improvements. The Department of Energy offers grants to eligible entities for clean energy initiatives, including financing mechanisms for private sector entities, grid technology improvements, and implementation of carbon efficiency standards. Eligible entities must meet requirements set by the Secretary and submit an application for consideration. The Secretary determines grant recipients based on submitted applications. The Secretary will provide grants based on application information and criteria for reviewing applications. Grant funds must be used for eligible purposes specified by the Secretary. Regulations will be issued to establish criteria for grants, including eligible measures, application criteria, and a point system for reviewing applications, considering regional energy disparities. The Secretary will consider regional disparities in energy production and the clean energy potential when awarding grants. An explanation of how grants will be objectively evaluated based on established criteria will be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4 authorizes $5 billion for the Secretary in fiscal year 2011 for the Act. SEC. 5 outlines cost offsets for clean energy grants and deficit reduction by denying deductions for major oil companies. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows major integrated oil companies to claim deductions for oil-related qualified production activities. This change applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
