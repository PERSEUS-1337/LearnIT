The Congress finds that expanded access to credit has led to high homeownership rates, but some lenders engage in predatory practices, making it costly for vulnerable families. Borrowers with fair credit can access prime loans with low rates, while those with poor credit resort to subprime loans with higher costs. Predatory lending involves unjustifiably high interest rates and fees in various mortgage products. Predatory loans, including refinancing, home equity loans, and home repair loans, often come with high interest rates, excessive fees, and unfair terms. These loans have disproportionately affected minority neighborhoods, stripping away wealth accumulated over decades. Some communities lacking access to traditional institutions have been targeted by lenders offering high-interest home equity loans, leading to foreclosure for many borrowers. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury in 2000 recommended legislation to curb predatory home mortgage lending. The proposed four-point plan included improving consumer literacy, disclosing credit scores, and providing borrowers with more accurate loan information. Government agencies are addressing predatory lending to protect borrowers from high-pressure sales tactics and misleading information. Nonprofit organizations are at risk, and more assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans. Consumer education and referrals to government agencies are crucial in combating this issue. The government is implementing a grant program to educate and counsel individuals about predatory lending. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide grants to States, local governments, and nonprofits for eligible anti-predatory lending activities, including education and counseling programs for vulnerable consumers targeted by predatory lending practices. The Secretary of the Treasury provides grants for anti-predatory lending activities, including counseling programs and referral services for homeowners and prospective homeowners. To be eligible for a grant, applicants must submit an application to the Secretary. State, local government, or nonprofit organizations must submit grant applications to the Secretary for approval. The maximum grant amount for any single grantee is $1,000,000. The Secretary will select applicants based on established criteria. The Secretary will establish a toll-free telephone number for predatory lending complaints using reserved funds. The number will assist consumers with predatory lending issues, provide information, refer borrowers to appropriate agencies, and coordinate with State and nonprofit organizations. The toll-free line will only be operated by actual persons, not pre-recorded messages. Additionally, a Predatory Lending Advisory Council will be established. The Predatory Lending Advisory Council is established in the Department of the Treasury to advise the Secretary on predatory lending practices related to home loans. The Council consists of 13 members appointed by the Secretary, including representatives of community-based organizations, State consumer protection officials, and private homeowners familiar with home mortgages.
