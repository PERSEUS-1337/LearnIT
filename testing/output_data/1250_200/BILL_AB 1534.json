    "title": "AB 1534",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of county assessors following state laws for consistent and accurate property assessment practices. They aim to protect taxpayers by ensuring decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes are made by certified staff. Implementation of education and certification requirements should be done efficiently with the advice of the State Board of Equalization. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended and renumbered to 681. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require competitive bids for appraisal work contracts. Contractors must maintain confidentiality of assessee information and records. Requests for information must be made by the assessor, with contractor authorization. A contractor must not share appraisal data with assessors from other counties. They must return and purge any confidential information after the contract ends. Contracts must include provisions for confidentiality and compliance with state regulations. Article 8.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code introduces Assessment Analyst Certificates for assessors and their employees. They must hold a valid certificate to make decisions on changes in ownership and property tax exemptions, excluding homeowners' exemption claims. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certificates, in collaboration with the Department of Human Resources. Applicants must pass the exam and demonstrate competency in making ownership change or exemption decisions. Those denied a certificate can request a review under the Administrative Procedure Act. This requirement does not apply to assessors or their employees holding valid appraiser certificates. The board requires certified assessment analysts to complete 24 hours of training annually to maintain their certificate. Any excess training hours can be carried over for up to three years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation, following procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. This requirement does not apply to assessors or their employees with valid appraiser certificates. The board issues an advanced assessment analyst certificate for applicants with at least three years of experience who have completed an advanced course of study or passed an advanced level examination. To maintain the certificate, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually, with excess hours carried over for up to two years. To maintain the advanced assessment analyst certificate, holders must complete annual training on legal developments. Applicants must disclose financial interests in legal entities at certification and annually thereafter. Duplicate filings with the Fair Political Practices Commission can fulfill this requirement. Failure to complete training may result in certificate revocation. The board may issue temporary and interim certificates to assessors or employees of the county assessor's office for up to one year and four years respectively, to allow them to apply for and take an examination for certification. Temporary certificates are for newly elected or appointed individuals, while interim certificates are for current assessors or employees making ownership or exemption decisions. Renewal of these certificates is not allowed. This article allows assessors to efficiently manage staff resources for exemption applications and change in ownership documents, as long as noncertificated staff do not make decisions. It applies only in counties that have passed a resolution requiring certification."
