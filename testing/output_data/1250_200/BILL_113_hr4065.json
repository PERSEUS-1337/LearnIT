Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more needs to be done. Consumers deserve the most secure technology to protect their information. The wireless industry should collaborate with law enforcement to educate consumers on security tools. The rapid changes in engineering and security necessitate ongoing efforts from the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumers. Mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made to address this issue, but more needs to be done. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should proactively develop solutions to protect consumers and deter theft. SEC. 343. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a provision for stolen mobile devices. In this section, definitions for terms related to mobile devices are provided, including 'account holder', 'commercial mobile data service', 'commercial mobile service', and 'mobile device'. A requirement is stated for providers of commercial mobile service or data to make a specific function available on mobile devices. The function required for providers of commercial mobile service or data on mobile devices allows the account holder to remotely delete all personal information, make the device inoperable globally, and prevent reactivation without authorization. The legislation prohibits manufacturing or importing mobile devices in the US unless they allow providers to remotely delete data, render the device inoperable, and prevent unauthorized reactivation. The Commission may exempt mobile service providers and manufacturers/importers from certain requirements if they provide technology that achieves the required functions on mobile devices. The Commission may waive requirements for low-cost voice-only mobile devices with limited data functions focused on text messaging. Providers cannot charge fees for providing required functions on mobile devices, and violators may face forfeiture penalties. The Commission may impose forfeiture penalties on entities found to have violated subsections (b) or (c) of the section, in addition to any other penalties. Manufacturers and providers of mobile services can take actions beyond those outlined in the section to protect consumers from mobile device theft. The definition of \"mobile device\" in section 343 of the Communications Act of 1934 applies to all mobile devices, with exceptions as specified. The Communications Act of 1934, section 343, applies to mobile devices manufactured or imported into the US after January 1, 2015. The FCC can grant compliance extensions for those needing more time to meet requirements."
