    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for kindergarten through 12th grade students. The findings of Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and promoting healthy lifestyle habits. Additionally, it addresses the increasing rates of childhood obesity and the economic impact of obesity-related diseases in the United States. The prevalence of obesity among children in the United States is a significant issue, with obesity-related diseases costing the economy over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to at least 300,000 deaths per year. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Despite recommendations for daily physical education for students, little progress has been made in implementing these programs. Despite recommendations for daily physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made in providing high-quality physical education opportunities. The unique role of quality physical education is to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students to adopt healthy and active lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes of instructional physical education per week, fitness education, and instruction in various motor skills. Physical education programs must include instruction in motor skills, cognitive concepts, social skills, physical activity, and nutrition. Teachers should have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development to stay updated in the field. Special Rule: Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the physical education curriculum funded under this program. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as those serving large and small student populations. Funding applications can include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reporting is required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are limited to 7% of funds, and the federal share must supplement, not supplant, existing funds.\" The Federal share for projects under this part is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations includes $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004."
