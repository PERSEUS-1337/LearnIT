If an eligible employer elects, within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, to have subsection (b) apply, the applicable pension plan's assets and liabilities will be spun off to an eligible spunoff plan, and the employer's liability will be determined by the eligible spunoff plan. The employer's liability for ongoing contributions to the eligible spunoff plan shall be determined by the plan, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The employer maintaining the plan will be liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms until the plan ceases to be an eligible spunoff plan. The employer's liability for ongoing contributions to the eligible spunoff plan shall be determined by the plan, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The employer will be liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms until the plan ceases to be an eligible spunoff plan. The liability of the employer maintaining an eligible spunoff plan resulting from termination under title IV of ERISA before December 31, 2010, shall be determined using specific interest rates as per the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The liability of an employer maintaining an applicable pension plan terminated under ERISA will be determined based on specific assumptions and methods. If the employer does not elect spinoff, they will be liable to the corporation instead of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. The liability of an employer maintaining an applicable pension plan terminated under ERISA will be determined based on specific assumptions and methods. If the employer does not elect spinoff, they will be liable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan for a portion of the adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2005. The adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities are defined as the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities with specific interest assumptions. The term \"fractional portion\" refers to a fraction representing the employer's contributions to a pension plan for specific plan years. An \"applicable pension plan\" is a single employer plan established in Alaska with multiple contributing sponsors not under common control. An eligible employer is one that participated in an eligible multiple employer plan on or after January 1, 2000. The allocable portion of an applicable pension plan's liabilities and assets is determined based on the employer's share of the excess liabilities over assets."
