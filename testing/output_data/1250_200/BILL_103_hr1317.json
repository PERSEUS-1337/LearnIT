    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Franchise Data and Public Information Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that franchise business relationships are a significant and growing part of the American economy, but there is a lack of reliable statistical information available to the public. Misleading information about franchise opportunities is common, and there is a need for objective data on franchise failures. The purpose of this Act is to provide comprehensive statistical information about franchising, enhance the reliability of information available to the public, and ensure prospective investors have the necessary information to make informed decisions about investing in franchise businesses. SEC. 3. NATIONAL FILING AND DATA COLLECTION. Filing of Franchise Disclosure Documents-- All individuals or entities selling franchises must submit a copy of the disclosure document to the Commerce Department. The document should be the most recent version with current information and the most restrictive version provided to prospective franchisees. The franchise disclosure document must be filed annually with the Commerce Department, and copies can be requested by Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and other Federal agencies. It is illegal for franchisors to falsely claim that a disclosure document has been filed with the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department will compile statistical information on franchise ownership and practices using disclosure documents filed annually. This information will be published within 240 days of the enactment of this section. The Commerce Department will compile statistical information on franchise ownership and practices by establishing categories for annual data compilation and analysis. They will consult with various organizations to identify additional categories of statistical information for data compilation and analysis. The Federal and State regulatory agencies can obtain statistical information on franchisors and franchisees through disclosure materials and public sources. Periodic questionnaires may be used to supplement this information, but cannot replace data available in disclosure documents or the Business Census. The Commerce Department must publish a report on franchise ownership and national franchising practices annually, based on data from disclosure documents and the Business Census. The report will be shared with Congress and made public. SEC. 4. CENSUS DATA ON FRANCHISE BUSINESSES. The Bureau of the Census will include statistical information on franchise businesses in its Business Census, consult with the Federal Trade Commission and Congress to establish criteria for identifying franchise businesses, and submit a report to Congress on the most cost-effective means to gather this data. The Bureau of the Census will collect data on franchise businesses for the Business Census, including identifying categories of data to be collected. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to create rules and regulations to implement the Act, including collecting fees for filing requirements. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms related to franchising, such as \"advertisement,\" \"disclosure document,\" and \"franchise.\" An advertisement is a communication related to a franchise offer, a disclosure document is a statement required by the Commission, and a franchise involves a commercial relationship where a franchisor grants rights to a franchisee to sell goods or services. Franchisees must adhere to quality standards set by the franchisor and use the franchisor's trademark in their business operations. The franchisor provides knowledge, assistance, and controls over the franchisee's business operations, including the use of trademarks and adherence to quality standards. A franchisee is required to make payment to the franchisor for goods at a wholesale price. The terms \"franchisee\" and \"franchisor\" are defined, and a subfranchise involves payment for the right to operate. The term \"subfranchise\" refers to a contract where a person pays a franchisor for the right to sell franchises or provide goods/services to franchisees."
