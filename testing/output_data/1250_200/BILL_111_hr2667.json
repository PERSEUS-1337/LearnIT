    "content": "The \"Early Support for Families Act\" allows for grants to states to implement quality home visitation programs for families with young children and expecting families under the Social Security Act. The purpose of this section is to improve the well-being of children by establishing quality home visitation programs for families with young children and expecting families. States must submit a grant application that includes a description of the programs, intended outcomes, evidence of effectiveness, and results of a needs assessment. The statewide needs assessment for home visitation programs in the State includes details on program quality, capacity, funding sources, gaps in services, and prioritizing high-need communities. The State must provide assurances to support programs in communities with the greatest need. The State must prioritize serving high-need communities, reserve 5% of grant funds for training, promote coordination with other services, provide referrals when appropriate, and comply with evaluation requirements. The Secretary may require other information. Allotments are made to Indian tribes based on the number of children in the tribe with income below 200% of the poverty line. States and territories receive allotments from the remaining funds after reservations are made. The Secretary shall allot funds to each State based on the number of children from families below 200% of the poverty line. Any unspent funds can be reallocated to other States. States must meet maintenance of effort requirements starting from fiscal year 2011. Beginning in fiscal year 2011, states must maintain or increase their expenditures on quality home visitation programs for families with young children. The Secretary will grant funds to states that meet the requirements, based on a reimbursable percentage of eligible expenditures or the amount allotted under subsection (c). In fiscal year 2011 and onwards, states must maintain or increase spending on quality home visitation programs for families with young children. The reimbursable percentage for eligible expenditures is 85% for 2010, 80% for 2011, and 75% for 2012 and beyond. Eligible expenditures cover voluntary home visitation programs for families with young children, focusing on evidence-based models that improve child and parenting outcomes. The program must focus on improving child and parenting outcomes, have well-trained staff, strong organizational capacity, and provide linkages to community resources. Priority funding is given to programs with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. The program prioritizes funding for home visitation models with strong evidence of effectiveness. Expenditures exceeding a set percentage of the State's allotment for the fiscal year are not eligible. States receiving grants under this section cannot use other federal funds to cover their share of costs for eligible expenditures. The Secretary may waive or modify provisions of the section for Indian tribes if it imposes an undue burden. States receiving grants must submit annual reports on progress in addressing program purposes and services delivered. The annual report must include details on services, program characteristics, provider qualifications, recipient demographics, program costs, outcomes, and training provided. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of home visitation programs funded under this section. The evaluation will assess the programs' impact on child and parent outcomes, effectiveness across different populations, and indicators to monitor program implementation. A report to Congress will be provided within 2 years. The Secretary will submit interim and final reports to Congress within 2 and 4 years, respectively, on the evaluation of home visitation programs. Additionally, annual reports will detail high-need communities targeted, service delivery models, and program characteristics. The evaluation of home visitation programs includes characteristics of programs, outcomes, research-based activities, training provided, costs, and monitoring methods by States. Funds are reserved by the Secretary from appropriations for these programs. The Secretary reserves funds for evaluation, training, and technical assistance for home visitation programs, as well as grants to Indian tribes. Appropriations for fiscal years 2010-2014 are specified, with Indian tribes treated as states in this section."
