    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2010\". The Congress declares the increasing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean to shipping due to thinning ice cover and technological advancements. It is in the interests of the United States to ensure safe, environmentally protective, and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic, protect sovereign interests, provide access for research vessels, and maintain peaceful relations. International cooperation is needed for reliable shipping and investment in navigation aids, ports, communication, mapping, and search and rescue. Mariners have sought benefits from Arctic sea routes for centuries, but coordinated regulations are necessary to address risks to Arctic residents. The United States requires coordinated shipping regulations to protect its interests in the Arctic, including the need for new icebreakers and potential growth of sovereign interests in the region. International cooperation models exist for managing regional waterways, and the US has ongoing research, security, environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic. The United States is seeking to protect its interests in the Arctic by building new icebreakers, coordinating shipping regulations, and establishing oil spill prevention capabilities through international cooperation. Initiating these efforts now is crucial, especially after the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, to safeguard US interests in the region. The Arctic Council completed an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment to safeguard US interests in the region. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe maritime shipping in the Arctic through agreements with other nations for aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill response, vessel tracking, and search and rescue. Coordination is done through the Committee on the Maritime Transportation System. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System coordinates domestic transportation policies in the Arctic. The Secretary of the department with the Coast Guard may enter agreements and contracts to carry out the section's purpose. Icebreaking is promoted for safe maritime navigation. The Secretary of Transportation can fund demonstration projects to reduce risks. The Secretary of the department with the Coast Guard can enter agreements to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and train mariners for ice navigation. Appropriations are authorized for seasonal operations and demonstration projects in the Arctic. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers, constructing new icebreakers, or a combination of both to fulfill the Federal icebreaking missions of the United States. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must analyze the impact on mission capacity and presence in the Arctic regions by 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. A report with recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act or completion of the High Latitude Study. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports with recommendations to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, regarding the impact on mission capacity in the Arctic regions if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. The Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to Congress within 270 days, assessing the need for more Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions. This includes evaluating current assets, projected needs for forward operating bases, and requirements for infrastructure and resources to support operations in these regions. The report to Congress will assess the need for additional Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, including logistics, communications, and resources for forward operating bases. It will also evaluate the icebreaking fleet's performance, capability, and conditions, along with estimating acquisition and maintenance costs for assets in these regions. The report to Congress will include detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability, including renovating and modernizing the existing fleet and replacing it. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act refers to the definition provided in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
