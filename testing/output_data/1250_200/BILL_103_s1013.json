    "content": "The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" is cited in this section, which amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It addresses the estate tax treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to address the estate tax treatment of land subject to a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land (minus any debt) can be excluded from the gross estate. The Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993 amends the Internal Revenue Code to address estate tax treatment of land within 50 miles of a metropolitan area or national park owned by the decedent or family for 3 years, and subject to a qualified conservation contribution. The Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993 amends the Internal Revenue Code to address estate tax treatment of land within 50 miles of a metropolitan area or national park owned by the decedent or family for 3 years, and subject to a qualified conservation contribution. This contribution must be made by the decedent or a family member, and if any development rights are retained, an additional estate tax is imposed on the first person disposing of the land. An additional estate tax is imposed on the first person disposing of property subject to a qualified conservation contribution under the Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993. The tax amount is based on the increase in estate tax liability if the value of the development right had been included in the decedent's gross estate. If only a portion of the property is disposed of, a pro rata portion of the tax is paid. The tax imposed on the first person disposing of property subject to a qualified conservation contribution is due by April 15 of the following year. A development right refers to the right to establish or use a structure for commercial purposes not directly supportive of the conservation purpose. The election for a qualified conservation contribution must be made on the estate tax return and is irrevocable once made. The executor must calculate the additional estate tax and file a Notice of the election. The executor must compute the additional estate tax for a qualified conservation easement and file a Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due. The basis of property excluded from the gross estate under section 2031(c) is amended. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, including land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after that date. SEC. 3. Gift tax on land with a qualified conservation easement. Gift Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement: The transfer of land with a conservation easement may not be considered a gift for tax purposes if the donor elects. If the donor retains development rights, an additional gift tax may apply. An additional gift tax is imposed on the first person disposing of property with retained development rights after the gift is made. The tax amount is equal to the increase in gift tax liability that would have occurred if the development right had been treated as a gift. The term \"development right\" is defined as per section 2031(c)(3)(C), and certain rules apply, with \"donor\" substituted for \"executor\". The amendments made by this section apply to gifts of land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992, with \"donor\" substituted for \"executor\". SEC. 4 amends Section 170(h)(5)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code to address contributions of property with separated surface and mineral rights. It states that if the likelihood of surface mining on the property is extremely low, it qualifies as a conservation contribution. The effective date for this amendment is contributions made after December 31, 1992. SEC. 5 clarifies that a qualified conservation contribution is not considered a disposition. (a) Qualified Conservation Contribution Is Not a Disposition. This amendment clarifies that a qualified conservation contribution by gift or otherwise is not considered a disposition for tax purposes. If real property is subject to a qualified conservation easement, this subsection does not apply to that property.\n\n(b) Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement Is Not Disqualified. This amendment ensures that property remains qualified real property even if it is subject to a qualified conservation easement. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, which include land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992."
