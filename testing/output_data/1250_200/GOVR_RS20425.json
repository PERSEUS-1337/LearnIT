Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite television services through their DBS systems. Another company, Rainbow DBS, offers satellite channels through a service called Voom. SHVIA provides consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes. The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same local market area. The distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial, with local signals being received within a network affiliate's local area and distant signals coming from elsewhere in the country. The original SHVA established the \"Grade B\" contour to determine eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive such signals, while those outside the contour could. The 1999 SHVIA law established rules for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside Grade B contours were not allowed to receive such signals, leading to court challenges. Over 2 million consumers reportedly had distant network signals terminated by their satellite companies. The FCC determined that new subscribers must not be able to receive a Grade B signal to access distant network signals. The FCC, in response to the 1999 SHVIA law, concluded that the Grade B standard should still be used for determining access to distant network signals via satellite. Consumers can seek a waiver if they believe they are not receiving a Grade A or Grade B signal. The process involves applying to the satellite company, which then forwards the request to the local network affiliate. The affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost to them. Consumers may receive distant network signals at no cost if they do not receive a Grade B signal from their local affiliate, have an RV or commercial truck with a satellite dish, or were receiving illegal signals that were terminated. RVs and commercial trucks cannot be fixed dwellings, and C-band dish users are not subject to a five-year limitation. The 1998 Miami court rulings allow consumers using \"C-band\" dishes to receive distant network signals indefinitely. SHVIA permits DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but it is not mandatory. Under the \"must carry\" provision, DBS companies must carry all local TV stations in a market if they choose to provide local broadcast programming in that market. The must carry provision for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002, requiring them to carry all local TV stations in a market that wish to be carried, with exceptions for duplicative programming and educational stations. EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004, with plans to add more markets. There are 210 designated market areas in the United States, with EchoStar reporting that 83% of the population could receive its local-into-local service after passing the 100 DMA mark. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services to reach more TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to help small and rural areas access local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers have a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network signals, set by government prices until December 31, 2004. The 1999 law extended the compulsory license for distant network signals for five years. The 108th Congress is considering whether to extend it further and change how prices are set. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. SHVIA provisions permit satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and make must-carry requirements effective for satellites. Sports blackout applies for network stations only if technically feasible and not economically prohibitive. Subscribers who do not receive a Grade A intensity signal can access distant network signals. The 1999 law extended the compulsory license for distant network signals for five years, allowing subscribers to access distant network signals if they do not receive a Grade A intensity signal. The law also permits subscribers to seek waivers from local affiliates if signal strength is in doubt, and C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. Additionally, a new compulsory license for local network signals with no sunset date was created. The 1999 law extended the compulsory license for distant network signals until December 31, 2004 and introduced a new compulsory license for local network signals with no expiration date. It also reduced copyright royalty payments for satellite companies by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. Additionally, it eliminated the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers and allowed satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed by Congress as part of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. It created a board to select recipients for up to $1.25 billion in loan guarantees to build systems for local television signal access. The act is technology neutral and aims to serve \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas, with a focus on providing high-speed Internet access. The Board issued regulations for the program in 2003. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003. An application period ended April 21, 2004, with one incomplete application received. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The FCC was required to conduct tests to determine interference between terrestrial systems and DBS satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. The MITRE Corporation concluded that co-existence would require mitigating techniques for MVDDS systems. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist with mitigating techniques, but dismissed applications by Northpoint and others, opting to auction the frequencies instead. Northpoint objected and did not participate in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. The language regarding the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band was included in the Senate-passed version of the FY2004 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill, but was ultimately not included in the final version of the bill."
