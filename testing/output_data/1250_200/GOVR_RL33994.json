    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste prematurely in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta called for the UN to stay for five more years in 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. Civilians displaced in 2006 returned home in 2008-2009. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 by a group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed. Security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms after the 2006 mutiny. Observers are concerned about the delay in implementing security reforms in Timor-Leste following the 2006 mutiny by security forces. The joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on from the past. There are worries about government plans to withdraw funds from the Petroleum Fund in 2009. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, providing assistance with construction projects. In 2009, China increased its involvement in Timor-Leste by providing assistance with construction projects and offering to sell heavy oil power plants and patrol boats. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007 to address various areas including housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and socio-economic development. The Portuguese colonial presence in East Timor lasted until 1975 when Indonesia invaded and occupied the country. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, leading to a period of occupation and widespread violence. A referendum in 1999 resulted in independence, but pro-integrationist militias caused destruction and displacement. The United Nations authorized a peacekeeping mission to restore order. In 1999, a U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission called International Force East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to restore order in East Timor after widespread destruction by militias. Australia played a leading role in this mission and has continued to support East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his work promoting the cause of Timor-Leste. Former President Xanana Gusmao is the current prime minister of Timor-Leste. Former President Xanana Gusmao of Timor-Leste, a former civil servant turned resistance leader, was captured by Indonesian forces in 1992 and later became the country's first president in 2002. He stepped down in 2007 to become prime minister through a coalition. Gusmao survived an assassination attempt by disgruntled security forces led by Alfredo Reinado in 2008. Mari Alkatiri, the former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amidst unrest but remains Secretary General of Fretilin with significant support. Former Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri of Timor-Leste, a Muslim minority, has considerable support within the country and a hostile relationship with Xanana Gusmao. Fretilin, the party that led the resistance to Indonesian rule, opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. The current unicameral national parliament of 65 members was elected in 2007, growing out of an 88-member Constituent Assembly that drafted the constitution for East Timor in 2002. East Timor formally became independent in 2002 under UN administration after Indonesian withdrawal. The Constituent Assembly declared itself the first national parliament of the new state, led by Fretilin, the party that resisted Indonesian rule. The parliamentary government includes a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao heads the coalition government, Alianca com Maioria Parlementar (APM), with four parties. The main opposition is Fretilin. Challenges include inexperienced members and language barriers. Committees attempt oversight over the executive branch. The parliamentary system in East Timor faces challenges due to language barriers and lack of resources. The 2007 elections saw former prime minister Ramos-Horta elected as president, with Xanana Gusmao becoming prime minister. Prior to this, elections were held in 2001 and 2002, leading to the drafting of a new Constitution and Gusmao's victory as president. In the 2002 Presidential election in East Timor, independence leader Gusmao won decisively as an independent candidate with an 86% voter turnout. In 2006, internal security issues led to the deployment of foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia. The largest contingent was from Australia with 1,100 troops. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) to support stability, democratic governance, and national reconciliation. The strife in East Timor in 2006 stemmed from divisions within the Fretilin party during their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with many military recruits being loyal to Xanana Gusmao. The tensions between the president and the ruling party, Fretilin, contributed to the politicization of the police and lack of regulatory framework for the security forces. The political turmoil in East Timor in 2006 was triggered by the dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri, leading to rioting, looting, and deaths. The divisions within the military and police forces, drawn from different districts, exacerbated the situation, with some police joining rebels in the hills. Alkatiri resigned in June as a result of the unrest. The turmoil in East Timor in 2006 led to looting, deaths, and mass exodus from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri was accused of forming \"hit squads\" and resigned in June. Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced for authorizing weapons transfer to supporters. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader in the violent protests, escaped from prison in 2006. Australian forces failed to capture him in 2007. The East Timor government's failed operation to capture Reinado in 2007 was a result of his persuasion of a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado, though not a major political figure, had support among resentful young men due to the foreign military presence. Gang violence, fueled by high unemployment rates, further destabilized East Timor after the 2006 clashes. Many Dili gangs viewed Reinado positively, contributing to the escalating violence in the country. The instability in East Timor since April 2006 led to widespread displacement, with 100,000 people remaining displaced by February 2007. Lack of access to water, poor sanitation, and risk of disease were major issues for internally displaced persons. More than 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, with high child mortality rates due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages and food price increases were also concerns. The high child mortality rate in East Timor is attributed to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages and food price increases are also concerns. Deteriorating social structures affect healthcare and education services, as well as response to natural disasters like floods and landslides. The transition from humanitarian programs to development activities is challenging due to extreme poverty levels. Funding has increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN providing emergency assistance and generating a Flash Appeal in 2006. In 2006, nearly $40 million was contributed to a Flash Appeal by UNOCHA. Security incidents in February and March 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement. Concerns arose about displacement due to civil unrest, prompting contingency planning by NDMO and MTRC. The international humanitarian aid community, including the UN, NGOs, and donor governments, worked closely with local organizations in East Timor. By April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery packages and the government began decommissioning. In April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery packages and the government began decommissioning some of the IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with assistance from international organizations. By November 2008, 10,400 families had returned, 21 camps had closed, and transitional shelter sites were constructed. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remained a problem for returning IDPs, with increasing food prices and shortages cited as reasons for food security deterioration. Land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence in home villages impacted the sustainability of returns. The reintegration of IDPs into their original communities in East Timor has been hindered by land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence. Despite no major incidents of violence during recent IDP returns, sustaining returns and developing durable solutions remain a challenge. The UNOCHA ended its formal mission in December 2008, and the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues. The UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste involves police personnel, military liaison, and staff officers to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, including support for electoral processes. The mission's mandate has been extended multiple times by the UN Security Council, highlighting the need for cooperation with the International Security Force. Despite challenges like IDP reintegration, poverty, and high unemployment, East Timor is relatively more stable than in 2006. The Secretary General's report in early January 2007 highlighted improvements in East Timor's overall situation since August 2006. Challenges such as IDP reintegration, poverty, and high unemployment persist in the context of fragile judicial and political institutions. The report emphasized the need for long-term commitment from the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance. Key areas of focus included political developments, restoration of public security, and support for democratic governance, socio-economic development, and humanitarian relief. In early January 2009, the Secretary General's report focused on political and security developments, the promotion of human rights and administration of justice, increased socio-economic development and humanitarian assistance, and support for the 'Compact' in Timor-Leste. Key areas included dialogue and reconciliation, democratic governance, public security, capacity building in the justice system, poverty alleviation, health indicators, and ongoing humanitarian activities. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved since 1999, with various resolutions authorizing missions and transitional authorities. The focus has been on ensuring durable solutions for IDPs and preparing a medium-term strategy for East Timor. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1272 (1999) established a peacekeeping operation in East Timor led by Sergio Vieira de Mello. The operation aimed to assist East Timor in its transition to independence by providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, and establishing a functioning government. UNTAET's mandate also included aiding East Timorese refugees in West Timor. In 2002, UNMISET succeeded UNTAET, with subsequent extensions of its mandate until 2005. The U.N. Security Council established the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) in 2005 for peace-building activities, with a mandate until 2006. UNOTIL supported state institutions, strengthened democratic governance, and developed a national police force. Special Representative Hasegawa highlighted progress in building skills for public administration, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. Progress has been made in building skills for public administration, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. However, there are concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in the justice and finance sectors, the need for continued supervision in human rights activities, and additional training for the Border Patrol Unit to minimize border incidents. In East Timor in 1999, Mr. Hasegawa described the situation as \"fragile\" and emphasized the importance of maintaining stability and peace for the upcoming elections in 2007. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006. The United States continued to provide bilateral assistance to East Timor for building a self-sufficient economy and basic public services. The United States provides assistance to East Timor to build a self-sufficient economy, develop public services, and support good governance. This aid includes support for media, civil society, political parties, electoral processes, judicial institutions, and governmental capacity. Experts believe East Timor still requires sustained bilateral, multilateral, and regional support. The U.S. aims to re-establish basic government functions, including security services, according to a 2010 State Department budget document. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) under USAID provides non-food humanitarian aid during international crises. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) under USAID provides non-food humanitarian aid during international crises, facilitating U.S. government emergency assistance. OFDA funds implementing partners for tasks like humanitarian coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, and peacebuilding in East Timor. In FY2008, OFDA provided $1.2 million, Food for Peace Program (FFP) contributed over $1.1 million, and the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) provided $0.8 million for humanitarian efforts. In FY2008, OFDA, FFP, and CMM collectively provided over $3.1 million in humanitarian aid to East Timor. Concerns about the country's readiness for the U.N.'s departure were raised in 2005, and events in 2006 validated these concerns. The need for improved security services, judiciary, transparency, and rule of law persists. The U.S.'s relationship with East Timor is intertwined with its relations with Indonesia. The United States' relations with East Timor are linked to its relations with Indonesia. Congress has expressed concerns about past human rights abuses in East Timor by the Indonesian military. The East Timorese government is looking to move forward and establish a productive relationship with Indonesia. The Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of 2009 includes Timor-Leste as an eligible state. This legislation aims to promote stable economic growth and development for the United States and least developed countries. The United States aims to promote stable economic growth and development for itself and least developed countries. Timor-Leste seeks preferential tariff treatment under the proposed act. Australia and New Zealand have been actively supporting peace and security in Timor-Leste since 1999, with Australia viewing Timor as within its strategic interest. Australia has strategic interest in Timor, with historical involvement in World War II and economic interests in hydrocarbon resources. They recognized Indonesian control of the province in 1989 but have since developed a working relationship with Timor-Leste for joint development of resources despite sovereignty disagreements. Timor-Leste and Australia have conflicting views on the location of a processing facility for hydrocarbon resources in their maritime space. Commercial concerns favor using facilities in Darwin due to the geography of the seabed floor and political security situation in Timor. The key participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a strong relationship with Portugal, with Portuguese colonial influence lasting from 1640 to 1975. Portugal remains a key provider of foreign assistance to Timor. Portugal is a key provider of foreign assistance to Timor-Leste, with approximately 13% of the populace speaking Portuguese. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after the departure of the Portuguese in 1975, leading to a guerilla movement and significant loss of life. The Indonesian military destroyed Timor's infrastructure and killed many Timorese following the 1999 referendum for independence. The Indonesian government has since sought better relations with Timor-Leste, with President Ramos-Horta urging the nation to move on from the past atrocities. Ramos-Horta urges Timor-Leste to accept that those responsible for the 1999 atrocities will never be tried, emphasizing the need to move forward. A truth commission revealed Indonesian army support for pro-Indonesian militias committing crimes. Chinese investment in Timor-Leste has been increasing since 2005, possibly to counter U.S. influence, access resources, and prevent alignment with Taiwan. This rise of Chinese influence may concern Australian strategic planners. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste, including high-profile projects and arms sales, raises concerns for Australian strategic planners. Timor-Leste supports a One-China policy and seeks to strengthen bilateral relations with China, despite criticism over plans to purchase power stations from China. East Timor's extensive off-shore energy resources can provide financial resources for development. Disagreements with Australia over maritime boundaries have been set aside for revenue sharing agreements. In 2005-2006, East Timor earned $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues. East Timor has earned $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues, with significant revenue sharing agreements in place. The Bayu-Udan field is estimated to have 400 million barrels of oil and 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Greater Sunrise is estimated to have 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion meters of natural gas. Industry favors Darwin for processing centers due to seabed configuration and lack of infrastructure in East Timor. ConocoPhillips has built a new LNG plant near Darwin, while East Timor prefers a plant on its southern coast. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023, with $3.2 to $5 billion in energy revenues banked since 2005. East Timor has earned between $3.2 billion and $5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, most of which is placed in a Petroleum Fund. The government has been criticized for spending money from the fund, intended to save oil and gas revenues for future generations. The country's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. East Timor is described as the poorest country in Asia with a dual economy, heavily reliant on agriculture. The 1999 violence left infrastructure devastated, leading to widespread poverty and lack of basic amenities. International support is needed for job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and improved health and literacy rates. Language barriers may also pose challenges, as Indonesian is more widely used. Significant economic development is needed in East Timor to improve living standards, with job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and health and literacy improvements being key priorities. Language barriers exist, with Indonesian being more widely used than Tetun or Portuguese. External assistance remains crucial post-independence, especially for governance capacity building. Economic activities include coffee production, tourism potential, and fisheries. Challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, educating the workforce, implementing the rule of law, and rebuilding infrastructure. East Timor is a member of the World Bank and IMF, with interest in ASEAN membership. In January 2000, an international commission recommended establishing a tribunal for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. Indonesia conducted its own investigation, leading to dissatisfaction from the US and allies. The Serious Crimes Unit indicted over 380 individuals, convicting 55, while Indonesia only imprisoned one person. President Gusmao supports a joint Truth and Friendship Commission with Indonesia. President Gusmao supports a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities in East Timor in 1999. Some criticize Gusmao for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented human rights abuses. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is likely that the approach to resolving past abuses by Indonesians will remain unchanged. The report highlighted issues in East Timor, such as police misconduct, lack of due process, and challenges with security forces. Concerns were raised about the country's readiness for a U.N. departure due to fragile state institutions. Improvements in security services, judiciary, and institutional transparency were deemed necessary. East Timor requested U.N. presence for security, training, and electoral assistance. The U.S. suggested reducing reliance on direct U.N. aid but continuing support in various sectors. Assistance could come from other international entities like UNDP and the World Bank. Debate arises on the timing of the U.N.'s departure from fragile states. Questions arise about the United Nations' duration in fragile states, needed support from the international community, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and national capacity building. Donor fatigue and limited budgets add pressure for assistance, with complicating factors in determining the best course of action, as seen in the East Timor situation."
