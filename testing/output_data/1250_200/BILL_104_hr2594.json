The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act defines a \"period of continuing unemployment\" as a single registration period or series of consecutive periods with more than 4 days of unemployment. Benefits end when rights are exhausted, and there is a limit on benefits if remuneration exceeds a certain amount. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act limits benefits if an employee's remuneration exceeds the base year monthly compensation base. Remuneration includes any gross amount that would have been payable if the employee was ready and willing to work during the registration period. SEC. 3. WAITING PERIOD FOR SICKNESS BENEFITS. Amendment to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act regarding the payment of sickness benefits after a waiting period. Benefits are payable to qualified employees for each day of sickness after the 4th consecutive day of sickness in a period of continuing sickness, with exceptions for the first registration period.

Benefits are payable for each day of sickness after the 4th consecutive day in a period of continuing sickness, with specific definitions and rules outlined.

If not a multiple of $1, it is rounded down. SEC. 5 sets the maximum number of days for benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to set the maximum number of days for benefits at 130 for both unemployment and sickness. Benefits cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year.

Extended benefits are provided for employees with 10 or more years of service who have exhausted their normal benefits. Extended unemployment or sickness benefits can be paid for up to 65 days within an extended benefit period. The period starts on the first day of unemployment or sickness after exhausting normal benefits and lasts for 7 consecutive 14-day periods. The extended benefit period ends when the employee qualifies for benefits again based on post-exhaustion compensation. Extended sickness benefits can continue until the employee turns 65, with the option to pay benefits for days of unemployment. Employees with 10 or more years of service, who did not voluntarily retire or leave work without cause, can receive accelerated benefits for 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment or sickness.

Employees with 10 or more years of service, who did not voluntarily retire or leave work without cause, can receive accelerated benefits for 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment or sickness. In cases where an employee is not qualified during the current benefit year but becomes qualified for the next year, the succeeding benefit year will begin on the first day of the month when the unemployment or sickness starts. There is an exception for sickness benefits where payment is not permitted after the employee turns 65 until the next benefit year. The Board may use available records to determine the employee's age for these purposes. Repeal of Deadwood and Expired Provisions in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Section 2(h) and Section 17 of the Act are repealed, removing outdated provisions related to age determinations and supplemental unemployment benefits. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on the date of enactment."
