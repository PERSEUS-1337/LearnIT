The Waterfront of Tomorrow Act of 2013, also known as the Act, includes a study directed by the Secretary of the Army to enhance flood protection and climate resilience for New York City. The study will explore traditional engineering solutions like tide gates and seawalls, as well as alternative approaches such as oyster reef restoration and tidal wetland construction to reduce storm surge impacts and retain stormwater while providing environmental benefits. The study will also assess the cost, time, and potential impact of implementing these measures. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate measures for enhancing flood protection and climate resilience for New York City coastal communities and critical infrastructure. The study will assess the potential impact of measures on the environment, housing, commerce, and recreation, and make recommendations on the most effective measures to protect against events like Hurricane Sandy. The activities will be coordinated with another study by the Corps of Engineers to prevent duplication of efforts, and a report on the study results will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The Secretary will transmit a report to Congress on the results of a study conducted through the Chief of Engineers. The Administrator of the EPA will conduct a study on the environmental impact of major disasters, ensuring studies are done on at least 10% of declared disasters in a fiscal year. The goal is to determine the impact on the waters of the United States. The Administrator will study major disasters to determine if industrial facilities caused pollution in waterways and how to prevent future incidents. A report must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of a disaster declaration. The National Freight Policy is amended to include goals related to accounting for socioeconomic and environmental impacts of moving cargo through communities. Additionally, ports and harbors are to be incorporated into the national freight network. Next Generation Ports are also addressed in the following section. Improvements to port infrastructure and intermodal rail and highway networks are authorized through grants to states and local governments. Local preferences and environmental concerns must be considered to minimize disruptions and adverse impacts. A green port designation for ports meeting environmental standards is established, with grants and technical assistance available. The Maritime Administration can provide grants and technical assistance to green ports to implement innovations that reduce environmental impacts. SEC. 5. WATERFRONTS AS MAIN STREETS. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a grant program for environmentally sustainable waterfront projects. States and local governments can apply for grants by meeting specific criteria related to economic growth and environmental sustainability. The maximum grant amount will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may award grants to State or local governments for environmentally sustainable waterfront projects, with a maximum grant amount of $10,000,000. Recipients must submit annual reports on performance measures for 3 years. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 75 percent."
