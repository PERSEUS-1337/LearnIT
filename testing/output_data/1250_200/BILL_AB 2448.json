    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11320.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to specify the sequence of employment-related activities required for recipients of aid under this chapter. Recipients must undergo orientation, appraisal, job search, job club participation, family stabilization, high school equivalency program, or substance abuse, mental health, or domestic violence services as determined by the county. The recipient must undergo assessment if employment is not found or job search is not likely to lead to employment. A welfare-to-work plan will be developed specifying work activities and supportive services. The welfare-to-work plan includes activities such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, subsidized public sector employment, work experience, and on-the-job training. Unpaid work experience is limited to 12 months, with the option to extend with agreement. The county welfare department reviews and revises work experience assignments to prepare participants for employment. Grant-based on-the-job training allows for cash grant diversion to the employer as a wage subsidy, with participant agreement required. Information on job termination, Earned Income Tax Credit, and increased CalFresh benefits is included in the agreement. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and increased CalFresh benefits can be obtained to boost earned income. Financial supports should increase current income and future social security income. Grant-based on-the-job training includes community service positions. Wages funded by cash grant diversion are not exempt from income calculation. The program offers various forms of supported work, including on-the-job training with wages partially offset by cash grants, workstudy, self-employment, community service, adult basic education, job skills training, and vocational education. The program offers vocational education and training, job search assistance, education related to employment, progress in secondary school or high school equivalency program, mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence services, and other activities to help individuals obtain unsubsidized employment. The Welfare and Institutions Code requires applicants or recipients to participate in welfare-to-work activities, including vocational education, job search assistance, and other activities to assist in obtaining unsubsidized employment. The 24-month limit for these activities can be non-consecutive, and months meeting requirements do not count towards the limit. After 24 months of welfare-to-work activities, aided adults must participate in various employment programs such as unsubsidized employment, job training, vocational education, and community service. The provision of child care services to individuals participating in a community service program is one of the conditions that do not count towards the 24 months of participation allowed in welfare-to-work activities. Other conditions include job search, assessment, welfare-to-work plan development, no longer receiving aid, excused participation for good cause, and exemption from participation. The recipient may be excused from participation for good cause, exempt from participation, or required to participate in specific programs. This includes family stabilization or high school equivalency programs, with limits on the duration of participation. County welfare departments must provide written notice to recipients subject to the 24-month time limitation, explaining how to claim exemptions and extensions. The notice should be given at the time of application, during annual redetermination, after 18 months of participation, and before the 21st month towards the limit. It must include the remaining months of eligibility, requirements for recipients, and the process to dispute the counted months. The recipient must be informed about disputing counted months, modifying their welfare-to-work plan, and seeking exemptions or extensions from the 24-month time limit. The department will establish further details on noticing and engagement requirements within 18 months. The workgroup may recommend refining procedures and due process requirements for individuals. An assistance unit with an eligible adult receiving assistance can continue in a welfare-to-work plan for up to 24 months, starting from January 1, 2013. Assistance received before this date does not count towards the 24-month limit. Section 11325.3 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 11325.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows recipients who have not completed high school to participate in a high school equivalency program. Participation is optional, and recipients can choose to engage in job-related activities instead. Recipients eligible under this section are not required to undergo an assessment before joining the program."
