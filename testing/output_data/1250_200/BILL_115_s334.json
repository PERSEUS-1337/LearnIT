    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing, citing reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing is supported by various reports, including findings that show no evidence of groundwater contamination from fracture fluid. Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified that there are no proven cases of groundwater contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency stated that there have been no proven cases of water contamination from the fracking process. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes. Congress has chosen not to include hydraulic fracturing in the underground injection control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The hydraulic fracturing process is regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes. In 2011, new Federal regulations were proposed for hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A study in 2012 found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. In 2014, a report highlighted the improvement of State-based oil and gas regulations for groundwater protection. With significant industry growth in the past five years, states have enhanced laws and regulations for groundwater protection in oil and gas production. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is addressed in the Act as well. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents for fracturing purposes within its boundaries. Federal land must adhere to the laws of the state where it is located for such activities."
