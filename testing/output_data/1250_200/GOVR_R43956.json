    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Administered by the DOJ, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved. Most claims are related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests between 1945 and 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. RECA benefits must be applied for before July 10, 2022, as the program will end. The Nevada Test Site conducted 928 atomic weapons tests, with 828 underground tests and 100 atmospheric tests releasing radioactive material. Atmospheric tests were conducted between 1951-1958 and 1962, with the largest test yielding 74 kilotons of TNT. RECA program benefits include $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments of $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These benefits are not adjusted for changes in wages or cost of living, and are not subject to federal income tax. However, they may be reduced by other payments received for related illnesses or injuries. Additionally, uranium workers eligible for RECA may also receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. RECA benefits are paid to survivors in order of precedence if the claimant is deceased. Only specific survivors are eligible for benefits, and if none are present, no benefit is paid. To be eligible, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements by being present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in designated geographic areas. During atmospheric atomic weapons testing, individuals in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site, may be eligible for RECA benefits if they held certain occupations and performed designated activities. Individuals who were onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including at NTS, may be eligible for RECA benefits if they held specific occupations and performed designated activities such as decontamination or cloud tracking. Individuals eligible for RECA benefits as onsite participants must have been involved in activities such as cloud tracking or maintenance on the atoll of Enewetak during specific timeframes. On the other hand, downwinders must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period to qualify for benefits based on exposure rather than participation in atomic weapons testing. To qualify for RECA benefits, downwinders must have been near NTS during specific timeframes and developed certain types of cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for a year or been exposed to a certain amount of radiation between 1942 and 1971 in specific states to be eligible for benefits. The RECA benefits eligibility criteria for uranium millers and ore transporters include specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in uranium mills or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 in certain states and developed conditions like lung cancer, renal cancer, or respiratory diseases after radiation exposure. The RECA program administered by the DOJ's Civil Division provides benefits for individuals with specific diseases like renal disease or non-malignant respiratory diseases. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with special considerations for Native Americans. Application decisions are made within 12 months of receiving all required materials. The RECA program, administered by the DOJ's Civil Division, provides benefits for individuals with specific diseases. Decisions must be made within 12 months of receiving all required materials, or the application is automatically approved. Grants are provided to health centers and organizations for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. RESEP clinics operate in several states, including one for Native Americans. Applicants are not required to be screened at RESEP clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ for review by an appeals officer. Applicants denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. An appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general will review the appeal and make a decision. If dissatisfied, applicants can seek judicial review. Licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations can represent claimants, with limitations on fees for attorneys. The RECA program allows attorneys to receive fees of 2% or 10% of benefits awarded, depending on the contract date with the claimant. Attorneys can also recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims. Legislation may expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers. No statutory changes have occurred since 2000, but unresolved issues may keep RECA on the congressional agenda. Since 2000, there have been no statutory changes to the RECA program, but unresolved issues may keep it on the congressional agenda. To qualify for benefits as a downwinder, one must have been present in designated counties during atmospheric testing at NTS. Residents outside these areas have expressed health concerns but cannot receive compensation through the program. The inability to win civil judgments against the government or testing contractors led to Congress's involvement in RECA. The RECA program was created in 1990 due to downwinders' inability to win civil judgments against the government or atomic testing contractors. Legislation introduced in 1979 aimed to compensate downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS, including those with cancer and damaged sheep herds. Eligibility was based on specific geographic areas around NTS where higher cancer rates were observed. The proposed boundaries for the affected area under H.R. 4766 include parts of Nevada, Utah, and California, as well as northern portions of Mohave and Coconino Counties in Arizona. The bill would have made the United States liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, and uranium miners, and created a federal advisory board to add specified cancers to the list. Eligibility for downwinders was based on specific counties and geographic features in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill proposed expanding the downwinder eligibility area for RECA, including parts of Nevada, Utah, and California, as well as northern portions of Mohave and Coconino Counties in Arizona. The original RECA statute covered specific areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, but subsequent amendments in 2000 expanded the eligibility area. Members of Congress have introduced bills to further expand eligibility for NTS downwinders. In response to a mandate from Congress, HRSA asked the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure on downwinders. The NRC recommended against making decisions solely based on scientific evidence related to expanding the downwinder eligibility area. The NRC's final report in 2005 advised against expanding downwinder eligibility based solely on geography. They recommended a science-based approach considering factors like exposure to Iodine 131 through milk consumption. The NRC suggested using a model of probability of causation for evaluating RECA benefits claims. The NRC recommended a science-based approach using the probability of causation to evaluate RECA benefits claims, considering factors like exposure to Iodine 131 through milk consumption. This model would estimate individual absorbed doses of radionuclides based on various factors, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits. Congress would determine the threshold for awarding benefits or varying levels based on the probability of causation. This approach has not been part of the RECA program or its amendments. The NRC recommended a science-based approach using the probability of causation to evaluate RECA benefits claims, considering factors like exposure to Iodine 131 through milk consumption. This model would estimate individual absorbed doses of radionuclides based on various factors, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits. Congress would determine the threshold for awarding benefits or varying levels based on the probability of causation. The probability of causation model recommended by the NRC is likely to result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels and the limited cancer-causing potency of ionizing radiation. The committee's conclusions on RECA benefits for uranium workers are based on scientific information. Eligibility for benefits is limited to those exposed to radiation before 1972 due to the end of government uranium procurement for atomic weapons. Efforts have been made to expand eligibility to workers exposed after 1971 through legislative amendments. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, are still at risk for radon-induced diseases. The current MSHA annual exposure limit for radiation is higher than NIOSH's recommendation, allowing miners to be exposed to higher levels of radon. The intent of the RECA program is to provide \"partial restitution\" to those affected by atomic weapons tests and uranium miners. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by atomic weapons tests and uranium miners. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond the original intent of the program. Illnesses from commercial uranium activities may be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
