    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise statement introducing the title and findings of a document. The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" was created due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 setting tight spending caps and leading to sequestration in 2013. Lawmakers negotiated higher spending levels for defense and non-defense discretionary spending in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, but a new agreement is needed to avoid further cuts. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry have criticized the impact of sequestration on defense spending, stating that it undermines the capabilities and readiness of the armed forces. NDD United, an alliance of over 2,500 organizations, argues that the cuts in non-defense discretionary spending are hindering economic recovery and business growth. The sequester's impact on the economy, business growth, public health, education, and infrastructure is criticized by Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry. The House Committee on Appropriations' bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to education and housing programs, risking harm to vulnerable Americans and weakening the nation's economic recovery. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, creating 500,000 jobs next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation on time, preventing a government shutdown. The 2013 shutdown cost 120,000 private-sector jobs, reduced GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%, led to 6.6 million lost workdays, $500 million in lost visitor spending at national parks, delayed $4 billion in tax refunds, affected 6,300 children's access to Head Start, and postponed hundreds of food safety inspections. To prevent another Government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are necessary. Raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester are essential components. It is preferable to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes, but sequester relief must occur regardless. SEC. 2. BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL AGREEMENT ON SEQUESTER RELIEF. A bipartisan measure shall be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed by leaders from the House and Senate for approval and consideration of the measure. The measure described in subsection (a) requires approval by a majority of individuals appointed by House and Senate leaders. If approved, it will be considered under specific procedures from the Budget Control Act of 2011, with certain date substitutions. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This includes changes to dollar amounts in various paragraphs and the application of adjustments to the discretionary spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget will nullify fiscal year 2016 spending limits if the measure in section 2(a) is not enacted by October 1, 2015."
