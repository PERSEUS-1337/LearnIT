The \"Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2014 and includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans. Section 401(a)(9)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to require distribution of an employee's entire interest within 5 years of their death, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries. The amended Section 401(a)(9)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code states that if interest is payable to an eligible designated beneficiary, it must be distributed over the beneficiary's life expectancy or within 1 year of the employee's death. The amended Section 401(a)(9)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code specifies that distributions for surviving spouses must begin no earlier than the employee would have turned 70 1/2, and if the spouse dies before receiving distributions, the rules apply as if the spouse were the employee. The amended Section 401(a)(9)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code specifies that distributions for surviving spouses must begin no earlier than the employee would have turned 70 1/2. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before their portion is fully distributed, specific rules apply to distribute the remaining portion within 5 years. The definition of an eligible designated beneficiary is also clarified in the Internal Revenue Code. The term 'designated beneficiary' refers to an individual chosen by the employee. An 'eligible designated beneficiary' is someone who is the employee's surviving spouse, a minor child, disabled, or chronically ill at the time of the employee's death. An eligible designated beneficiary is defined as a surviving spouse, minor child, disabled, chronically ill individual, or someone not more than 10 years younger than the employee. An individual described in clause (ii)(II) ceases to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority. The requirement of subparagraph (B)(i) is not met unless any remaining portion of an employee's interest is distributed within 5 years after that date. Section 401(a)(9)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended for employees becoming 5-percent owners after age 70\\1/2\\. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013. The amendment regarding employees becoming a 5-percent owner applies to plan years ending before, on, or after the enactment date. Employees who die after December 31, 2013 are subject to the amendments made by this section. If an employee has not retired before 2014 and is considered a 5-percent owner for a plan year ending in 2013, certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code apply. Additionally, if a designated beneficiary of an employee who dies before January 1, 2014, passes away after December 31, 2013, the amendments apply to any beneficiary of the designated beneficiary. The designated beneficiary is then treated as an eligible designated beneficiary for specific purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section do not apply to existing qualified annuity contracts that were in effect before the enactment of this Act. A qualified annuity is defined as a commercial annuity or one payable by a defined benefit plan, with substantially equal periodic payments over the lives of the employee and a designated beneficiary. The section 401(a)(9) of the Code outlines requirements for qualified annuity contracts, including annuity payments over the life expectancy of the employee and designated beneficiary. An irrevocable election for annuity payments method and amount must be made before January 1, 2014. An irrevocable election must be made before the enactment of this Act regarding the method and amount of annuity payments to the employee or designated beneficiaries."
