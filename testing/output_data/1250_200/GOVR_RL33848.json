    "content": "United Nations reform is a key policy issue for the United States, with Congress having the responsibility to appropriate funds and impose conditions on payments. Reform efforts have been cyclical, focusing on inefficiencies, duplication, and fraud within the organization. Proposed U.N. reforms address accountability, duplication, fraud, and mismanagement of resources. Historical reforms reflect global economic and political trends, with a focus on increasing membership and addressing international cooperation challenges. Recent reform efforts stem from budgetary challenges, controversies like the Iraq Oil-For-Food Program, and perceived ineffectiveness in human rights issues. Efforts to reform the U.N. have been driven by budgetary challenges, controversies like the Iraq Oil-For-Food Program, perceived ineffectiveness in human rights issues, and allegations of sexual abuse by U.N. staff. Various key actors, including Members of Congress and the Obama Administration, have been involved in discussing reform priorities over the past 10 to 15 years. In 2005, a World Summit at U.N. Headquarters in New York laid the foundation for reforms such as improving management structures, strengthening the Security Council, enhancing system coordination, and creating a new Human Rights Council. Efforts to reform the U.N. have been ongoing since the 2005 World Summit, focusing on improving management structures, strengthening the Security Council, enhancing system coordination, and creating a new Human Rights Council. Progress on these reforms varies, with some stalled or incomplete. Congress generally supports the U.N. and its mission but can be critical when effectiveness is questioned. The success of these reform efforts depends on effective implementation and addressing any weaknesses that may arise. Congress can use various legislative tools to influence and direct U.S. policy at the United Nations, including placing financial conditions on U.S. funding. This has been done in the past to withhold funds from U.N. programs and policies that Congress did not approve of, such as the U.N. Special Unit on Palestinian Rights and the Preparatory Commission for the Law of the Sea. Currently, the U.S. withholds funds for some activities and programs related to the Palestine Liberation. The U.S. withholds funding from certain U.N. programs related to the Palestine Liberation Organization and entities associated with it. Funding was also withheld from UNESCO due to their decision to admit \"Palestine\" as a member. The impact of withholding payments depends on the program's funding sources, with some programs being funded from multiple budgets, making it harder for U.S. withholdings to have a significant immediate impact. The impact of U.S. withholding funding from certain U.N. programs varies depending on the program's funding sources. Withholding funds from programs primarily funded by member state contributions could have a greater impact. Congress has the authority to adjust U.S. assessment levels or link payments to policy objectives, as seen in past legislation such as the Helms-Biden Agreement. Some Members of Congress have proposed shifting U.S. funding from assessed to voluntary contributions. Some Members of Congress propose shifting U.S. funding from assessed to voluntary contributions at the United Nations. Opponents fear this may weaken U.S. influence and hinder diplomacy. They argue that withholding payments infringes on treaty obligations and strains relations with other member states. Supporters believe linking funding to reforms can drive comprehensive change, despite concerns about the feasibility of proposed legislation. Advocates push for comprehensive reform at the United Nations, emphasizing the effectiveness of tying U.S. funding to reform efforts. Past legislation threatening funding cuts led to substantive changes in U.N. operations. Congress's influence over funding is a powerful tool for reform, with various strategies available for consideration. Members of Congress can propose resolutions expressing opinions on U.S. policy at the United Nations. Some have worked with U.N. secretaries-general to advocate their positions and build relationships for negotiations. Collaboration with other U.N. member states is important for forming partnerships on reform policies. U.S. support for U.N. reform initiatives is crucial for consensus-building. The United States may wish to focus on a small number of reform priorities and pursue them vigorously in both multilateral and bilateral fora. It may also consider compromising with other member states on U.N. reform issues that it has identified as lesser priorities. The 114th Congress may wish to continue monitoring the implementation and overall progress of ongoing reform initiatives. The United States has historically supported the United Nations and played a key role in its establishment. Recent administrations have focused on re-engaging with the organization, emphasizing reform priorities such as budget discipline, transparency, and accountability. This includes measures like eliminating vacant U.N. posts and freezing staff salaries. The United States has historically supported the United Nations and played a key role in its establishment. Recent administrations have focused on re-engaging with the organization, emphasizing reform priorities such as budget discipline, transparency, and accountability. This includes cost-saving measures, improving transparency and accountability, reforming human resources practices, and overhauling day-to-day business practices. The Obama Administration has also implemented initiatives within the State Department aimed at evaluating and improving U.N. system transparency and effectiveness. The U.S. Mission to the United Nations created an administration program to track U.N. management reforms. The IO Bureau hired an advisor to review international organizations' effectiveness. The U.S. has resisted legislation tying contributions to U.N. reforms. Previous administrations, like the George W. Bush Administration, prioritized U.N. reform efforts for improved effectiveness. The Bush Administration prioritized U.N. reform efforts, focusing on management, oversight, and accountability. Despite dissatisfaction with the pace of reforms, they did not support withholding U.S. payments to the U.N. Finding common ground on reform definitions remains a challenge due to differing stakeholder perspectives. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. Secretary-General, has made U.N. reform a top priority during his tenure. He aims to improve delivery on the ground, utilize resources more effectively, and increase accountability. His efforts include restructuring departments, establishing a Change Management Team, and proposing staff improvements. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. Secretary-General, has prioritized U.N. reform by restructuring departments, establishing a \"Change Management Team,\" and proposing staff improvements. The effectiveness of his reform efforts is debated, with some arguing he needs to do more to push for comprehensive reform, while others point out limitations in his authority as Secretary-General. Opposition from developing countries has been seen towards reform initiatives, such as the Change Management Team supported by the United States. Opposition to U.N. reform initiatives, supported by the United States, stems from concerns of developing countries. Developed countries prioritize peace and efficiency, advocating for greater flexibility for the Secretary-General in implementing oversight and human resource reforms. Developing countries, the largest U.N. voting bloc, focus on development policies and resist reforms that may increase the power of developed nations. Developing countries, as the largest U.N. voting bloc, often oppose reforms that would strengthen the Secretary-General's power and diminish the General Assembly's authority. They fear that reform efforts may divert resources from development programs and are skeptical of reforms influenced by major financial contributors. This clash in reform philosophy has led to deadlock in the General Assembly, delaying management and budget reforms. In 2005, developed countries like the United States and Japan tried to tie the U.N. budget to progress on management reforms by imposing a spending cap of $950 million on a $3.6 billion budget. The General Assembly imposed a spending cap of $950 million on a $3.6 billion budget in 2005 to push for management reforms. In 2006, the budget cap was lifted after some reforms were approved, but others were delayed. Various groups have been created over the years to improve the United Nations, involving stakeholders like member states, NGOs, and academic institutions. Various groups, including the Volcker Commission, the U.S. Institute of Peace U.N. Reform Task Force, and Kofi Annan's 2005 report, made similar recommendations for improving the United Nations. They highlighted the need for internal oversight, Secretariat reform, staff buyouts, financial disclosure requirements, and overall streamlining of the U.N. system. An independent commission led by Paul Volcker investigated corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. The Volcker Commission investigated corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program and recommended fundamental administrative reform in the United Nations, including establishing an Independent Oversight Board, creating a Chief Operating Officer position, fair compensation for third parties, and expanding financial disclosure requirements. Congress directed the U.S. Institute of Peace to create a bipartisan task force to improve the U.N., allocating $1.5 million for the task force to submit a report on its findings to the House Committee on Appropriations. The task force, funded by Congress, recommended key reforms for the U.N., including creating an independent oversight board, a Chief Operating Officer position, a U.N. Ethics Office, and enhancing whistle-blower protection. It also suggested broadening financial disclosure policies, reviewing older mandates, implementing results-based budgeting, and offering a one-time buyout for unnecessary staff. Additionally, it proposed establishing a new U.N. Human Rights Council and incorporating sunset clauses into new mandates. On March 21, 2005, Secretary-General Annan released his report, In Larger Freedom, in response to the High-Level Panel's findings. The report included management reform recommendations such as reviewing old U.N. mandates, implementing a staff-buyout, establishing a decision-making body in the Secretariat, and proposing institutional and programmatic reforms like modifying the Security Council's composition and replacing the Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council. Annan recommended reforms to streamline the General Assembly agenda and committee structure for faster decision-making. U.N. reform initiatives may involve Charter amendments or non-Charter reforms. Charter amendments require approval by two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratification by two-thirds of member states. Non-Charter reforms are more common and easier to achieve. The U.N. Charter was first amended in 1963 to increase Security Council membership. The U.N. Charter has been amended to increase Security Council and ECOSOC membership. Possible reform initiatives include changing Security Council membership and adding or removing a principal organ. A General Conference can be convened to review the Charter, but one has never been held. General Assembly reforms have been authorized since 1945. The General Assembly has authorized reforms of its processes and procedures since 1945, without holding a Charter review conference. Various fora have been established for discussing reform issues, including a Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and a Working Group on the Security Council. Reforms have been implemented by adopting proposals introduced by member states or the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General can also institute reform as the chief administrative officer, such as restructuring departments and establishing a Change Management Team for future reform efforts. Other non-Charter reforms include consensus-based budgeting, the Office of Strategic Planning, and the Peacebuilding Commission. The United Nations has undergone various reforms since its establishment in 1945, including the creation of the Office of Strategic Planning in 1997 and the Peacebuilding Commission in 2006. Achieving comprehensive U.N. reform remains a challenge for member states, as differing views on the necessity and implementation of reforms can lead to delays or failures. Some member states may use U.N. reform as a guise to further their own policy goals, causing distrust among countries. Some observers question the motives behind U.N. reform proposals, citing distrust among member states. Secretary-General Annan proposed reforms in 2005 to be adopted as a package, but some suggest focusing on a few priorities for adoption. The U.N. is seen as slow to consider reforms due to a \"culture of inaction\" and resistance to change among managers and staff. Some argue that a \"culture of inaction\" within the United Nations hinders the implementation of reforms, with a lack of clear plans, deadlines, and cost estimates. The current U.N. budget constraints may also pose challenges for reform initiatives. The U.N. budget constraints may hinder reform initiatives, but some member states believe savings from other reforms could fund new programs. External relationships among member states can also impact reform efforts, influenced by factors like military conflict, political differences, and geography. Congress may need to assess past legislation's impact on U.N. reform measures. The Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment in 1986 aimed to increase U.S. influence over the U.N. budget by reducing the U.S. assessed contribution unless major financial contributors had a greater say. This led to a new budget process incorporating consensus-based decision-making. In 1993, the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services was established to enhance oversight and accountability. In 1993, the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services was established to enhance oversight and accountability within the U.N. system. Congress directed that 10% of U.S. assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget be withheld until certain conditions were met. In the 1990s, the Helms-Biden bill authorized payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations based on specific reform benchmarks. The U.S. agreed to pay $819 million in arrears and forgive $107 million in peacekeeping costs if the UN applied it to U.S. arrears. Congress required reductions in U.S. contributions to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping. The UN General Assembly reduced the regular budget assessment from 25% to 22% and peacekeeping share from 30.4% to 28%. U.S. peacekeeping assessment has since decreased to around 26.5%."
