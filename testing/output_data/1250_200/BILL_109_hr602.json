    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress found that prior to December 7, 1956, retired members of the uniformed services were led to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit urged Congress to fulfill these promises made in good faith to military members from 1941 to 1956. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit urged Congress to fulfill promises made in good faith to military members from 1941 to 1956 regarding fully paid lifetime health care. Congress has never ratified or acquiesced to this promise, leading to a judgment against retired officers' breach-of-contract claim. Only Congress has the legal power to address the moral claims raised by the retirees. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit urged Congress to fulfill promises made in good faith to military members from 1941 to 1956 regarding fully paid lifetime health care. Congress has never ratified or acquiesced to this promise, leading to a judgment against retired officers' breach-of-contract claim. Only Congress can address the moral claims raised by retirees and others affected. Congress is the only entity that can fulfill the promises made by recruiters to retirees of the World War II and Korean War era. Despite efforts to define and limit medical care for retired members of the uniformed services, access to healthcare in military treatment facilities has become difficult for many military retirees. The lack of adequate healthcare upon retirement is hindering the ability of retired service members to recommend a military career. While coverage under the TRICARE program has been extended to medicare-eligible retirees over 65, the needs of younger military retirees remain unaddressed. The United States should fulfill promises made to military retirees from World War II and Korean War era by providing high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members, regardless of age. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM. The Secretary of Defense will provide health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program to eligible beneficiaries, including members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, and dependents of deceased members. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members of the uniformed services, can enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan for self-only or self and family coverage. They are not required to meet eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5, except as provided in specific cases. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members of the uniformed services, can enroll in Federal Employees Health Benefits plans without meeting specific eligibility criteria. Members or former members described in certain sections are considered employees for enrollment purposes. Enrolled beneficiaries cannot receive health care under other sections but can continue to receive care in military facilities, reimbursed by the program. The eligible beneficiaries enrolled in Federal Employees Health Benefits plans can change plans, with government contributions limited to employee levels. Separate risk pools are maintained for premium rate establishment. Reimbursement for TRICARE Standard services is provided. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries who enroll in a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5 for health care costs not covered by the plan but would have been paid by the Department of Defense under TRICARE Standard. SEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS AT TRICARE NETWORK PHARMACY LEVELS TO CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES AND DEPENDENTS IN HARDSHIP CASES. Effective Date: October 1, 2005. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits obtained from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if they have a certification from their physician stating they lack access to a TRICARE network pharmacy due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals are those described in section 1108(b) of title 10, United States Code, who have primary coverage from another health benefits plan. SEC. 5. WAIVER OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM FOR CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act waives the monthly premium for eligible individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B, including retired military personnel, their spouses, and widows/widowers. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act exempts certain individuals from paying monthly premiums for Medicare Part B starting in January 2005. Rebates will be provided to eligible individuals using a specified methodology. The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173, 117 Stat. 2318) provides rebates to eligible individuals for premium or premium penalty paid under Section 1839 of the Social Security Act starting from January 1, 2005."
