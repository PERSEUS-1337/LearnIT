The Republic of Georgia is important for US interests due to its democratic stability, role in Black Sea security, and contributions to global peace. The US-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership highlights the intent to expand democracy, enhance defense cooperation, and promote cultural exchanges. Georgia's democratic nature is a core strength that fosters a deep friendship with the United States. Georgia's democratic nature is crucial for the strong relationship between the United States and Georgia. However, democracy in Georgia is facing challenges such as political freedom being under assault, limitations on press freedom, and violent suppression of opposition groups. Rights Report on Georgia highlighted significant problems during President Saakashvili's re-election in 2008, including allegations of intimidation, flawed vote-counting processes, and shortcomings in complaints and appeals. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association noted a widespread climate of fear, intimidation, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms in Georgia during his visit in 2012. The government in Georgia has been accused of undermining political parties and NGOs by prosecuting and detaining activists without sufficient evidence. Concerns have been raised about the blurred line between the ruling party and the state, especially with upcoming elections. President Saakashvili enacted constitutional changes to reduce his power and increase the prime minister's power ahead of the 2012 parliamentary elections. There are reports that Saakashvili plans to become Prime Minister if his party wins the majority of seats. Georgian businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili is also a key figure in the political landscape. United National Movement (UNM) wins majority of Parliament seats. Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Georgian businessman, launched Georgian Dream to challenge Saakashvili's control. Saakashvili stripped Ivanishvili of citizenship in response. Saakashvili regime aggressively undermines Georgian Dream's ability to compete in elections. The Georgian Government has increased harassment and detention of supporters of Ivanishvili and other opposition parties, often through violent means, without due process. Hundreds of opposition supporters have been detained in March 2012 to intimidate voters and opposition campaigners. Solomon Kimeridze, an Ivanishvili supporter, died under suspicious circumstances while in police custody. Georgian security officials killed two protesters using violent means to break up a peaceful protest on May 26, 2011. An investigation into this incident has been requested by various international bodies. The Georgian Parliament passed new election laws criticized by international bodies for limiting opposition parties' access to funds and being enacted in an abnormal way. The state audit agency controlled by Saakashvili created a division to investigate Georgian Dream and block financial support for opposition candidates. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association raised concerns about the impact of these changes on rights to association and peaceful assembly. The Saakashvili regime has distorted the Georgian banking sector to target Bank Cartu, owned by Bidzina Ivanishvili, violating international human rights law. The government seized millions of dollars in bank assets using a new law criticized by the American Chamber of Commerce for undermining the banking system. This law allows the government to seize loan collateral before the banks that issued the loan, specifically targeting Bank Cartu. The Saakashvili regime is targeting Bank Cartu, owned by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by seizing assets to force the bank out of business. The United States emphasizes the importance of a democratic Georgia to prevent instability and violent conflict in the region, warning that political support and financial assistance will be at risk if free and fair elections are not allowed. No funds for fiscal year 2013 can be used to assist Georgia until the Secretary of State certifies that the 2012 parliamentary elections were free, fair, and competitive. The report must include details on election observers, opposition parties' campaigning ability, and whether Bidzina Ivanishvili and the Georgian Dream Party participated."
