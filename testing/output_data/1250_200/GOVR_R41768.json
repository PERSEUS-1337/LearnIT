    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law of 2010 did not change these parity requirements. The federal parity law ensures that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are on par with medical and surgical services. It applies to certain plan types, including Medicaid managed care plans and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands the law's applicability to Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA also establishes Exchanges where health insurance can be purchased. The ACA requires all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to comply with federal parity law in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. QHPs will be available through both the small group and individual markets, and may also be offered outside of an Exchange. Medicaid may be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, with Medicaid benchmark plans partially complying with federal parity law. Medicaid plans are only required to ensure treatment limitations and financial requirements are on par for mental health and substance use disorder services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law. The law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Small employer group health plans are also exempt. The ACA did not change the small employer exemption, which remains in effect. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. While federal law requires copayments for Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services to be 20% by 2014, federal parity law aims to reduce coverage disparities between mental health services and medical/surgical services. However, it does not mandate coverage for mental health services. The ACA did not change the small employer exemption, and federal parity law does not require coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA created requirements for coverage of these services through Exchanges, where plans must offer Essential Health Benefits Package. The ACA requires plans offered through Exchanges to include the Essential Health Benefits Package, which consists of Essential Health Benefits, cost-sharing arrangements, and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of HHS defines the items and services included in the EHB, which must cover 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The benefits in the EHB must be comparable to those offered in a typical employer plan, as determined by a survey conducted by the Department of Labor. The ACA requires health plans to include Essential Health Benefits (EHB), which cover 10 categories of services including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The specific services in the EHB will be determined through the rulemaking process, with flexibility for additional benefits. States can define their EHB using benchmark health insurance plans. The HHS proposes allowing states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options for benchmark plans, with benefits comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to provide recommendations on determining and updating the EHB. The IOM released a report on this topic. The IOM released a report on essential health benefits, recommending coverage mandates for mental health and substance use disorder services under the ACA. Plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans are required to offer either the EHBP or EHB. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark equivalent plans to cover Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014, excluding certain cost-sharing arrangements. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of Exchanges are not mandated to offer EHB. Health reform changes will likely improve access to mental health and substance use disorder services, with more plans required to cover these services on par with medical and surgical services. Some plans may voluntarily offer these services to stay competitive in the market."
