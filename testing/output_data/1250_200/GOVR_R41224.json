The dairy industry faces issues of consolidation and industry concentration. Public workshops were announced by the Administration in 2009 to address competition problems in agriculture. A workshop specifically focusing on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry, including financial stress for dairy farmers, historical development, price movements, and industry structure in terms of consolidation and concentration at different market levels. The financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 led to over $1 billion in federal support, with an additional $350 million granted by Congress. Despite this assistance, the number of U.S. dairy farms and cows declined, resulting in a decrease in milk production. The financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 led to a decline in dairy farms and cows, resulting in decreased milk production. Average farm milk prices increased due to a rebound in foreign demand for dairy products. Financial concerns persist for dairy farmers due to lost farm equity and high feed prices. The industry and Congress are exploring options to manage fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The Obama Administration and Congress are also examining consolidation and concentration issues in the dairy industry. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years due to advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. Producers formed cooperatives to bargain with milk handlers, leading to the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 providing limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 granted antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives, leading to the use of classified pricing for milk. Federal milk marketing orders were established during the Great Depression to stabilize the market and ensure adequate milk supplies at reasonable prices. Import quotas were also enacted to protect producers from foreign competition, and government support for milk prices began in the late 1940s. Advancements in milk marketing have significantly changed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the late 1940s, the government started supporting milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Additional programs like the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were introduced in later years. Milk was primarily delivered to homes in the early 20th century, with only small amounts sold in stores. In the mid-20th century, advancements in transportation and packaging led to the transition of milk marketing from home delivery to retail stores. This shift facilitated the development of a national milk and dairy product market, with bulk milk now being transported long distances by tanker trucks. The relationship between farm and retail prices has been a longstanding issue in the dairy industry. The farm share of the retail food dollar has been declining in the agricultural sector due to various factors such as increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had decreased to 18.5%. This trend has raised concerns among some in Congress about the economic stress on farmers caused by processors and retailers. In 2006, USDA estimated that the average farm-value share of U.S. farm-origin food consumed was 18.5%, with the remaining 81.5% accounted for by various marketing factors. The farm share for milk and dairy products is about one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing. The trend for milk and dairy products remained generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. From July to December 2008, the farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, while the retail price only dropped by $0.28, widening the marketing margin. In December 2008, the farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, while the retail price only dropped by $0.28, widening the marketing margin to $2.35 per gallon. By January 2009, the difference between retail and farm prices reached a record-high of $2.43 per gallon. Throughout 2009, the price difference decreased to $1.69 per gallon in December, below the recent five-year average margin. Retail prices adjust slower to farm price changes, with adjustments to higher farm prices happening faster than decreases. Retail prices for milk adjust faster to increases in farm prices than decreases, a phenomenon known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can limit retail price adjustments to downward farm price movements. Competition effects of supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to higher prices for milk in stores offering additional services. Consolidation in the dairy sector has led to fewer and larger operations, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This trend has also led to fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Despite a decline in the number of operations, consolidation at the cooperative and processor level has followed a similar path to offset market power of large retailers and meet their demands. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to fewer and larger operations, reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. Concentration has increased as a small number of firms control most sales. The number of dairy farms has decreased due to higher output and technological advances. Despite this, total milk production has steadily increased. Domestic demand for milk products has grown slowly, with rising consumption of cheese offsetting declines in other products. Demand for milk and milk products has grown slowly at 0.4% per year since 1990. Consumption of dairy products like cheese has increased, offsetting a decline in fluid milk products. Exports of dairy products have reached record levels in 2008. The trend in farm numbers shows a decline in smaller farms, while farms with 1,000 or more cows have increased by 20% due to lower production costs. Large farms with 1,000 cows or more account for 47% of U.S. milk output. Large dairy farms with 1,000 cows or more account for 47% of U.S. milk output. These farms benefit from scale economies, modern facilities, and automated systems, leading to more efficient production. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms and higher operating costs due to purchasing feed. Wisconsin, on the other hand, has many small farms with an average size of 88 cows. Operating costs for dairy farms have been impacted by high feed costs, especially for farms that purchase feed. However, farms in regions like Wisconsin, where feed is produced on-site, tend to have lower operating costs. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution and product manufacturing, with the number of cooperatives declining since the 1940s due to mergers for economic benefits. The number of dairy cooperatives in the United States has been declining since the 1940s, with consolidations and strategic alliances leading to increased operational efficiencies. By 2007, only 155 cooperatives remained, but they accounted for 83% of farm milk marketings. The top four cooperatives, including Dairy Farmers of America and Land O'Lakes, controlled 40% of U.S. milk production in 2008. Cooperatives like Dairy Farmers of America, California Dairies, Land O'Lakes, and Northwest Dairy Association account for 40% of U.S. milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation supports the Capper-Volstead Act for allowing farmers to cooperate. Cooperatives help farmers negotiate with milk handlers and participate in federal milk marketing order changes. Some producers believe cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry faces challenges like declining demand for fluid milk and increasing demand for dairy products. In recent decades, changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector have impacted dairy processors and manufacturers. The number of dairy firms has decreased, with larger plant sizes to meet the needs of high-volume retailers and large customers. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the US has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry are similar to other food processing sectors, with the top four firms holding a significant market share in cheese and fluid milk processing. The four-firm concentration ratio for cheese processing was 35% and for fluid milk processing was 43%. Dairy processing concentration is not unusually high nationally, but local markets can be more concentrated. Industry concentration in the fluid milk sector has increased recently due to a merger in 2001. Cheese manufacturing concentration has ranged between 34% and 52% with no clear trend. The retail sector for food products has seen significant changes in recent years. The retail sector for food products has changed substantially in recent years, with price competition from nontraditional food retailers causing traditional supermarket chains to review pricing and product strategies. The top four firms in the U.S. grocery retailing industry accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 36% by 2005. National-level concentration ratios are relevant for food product suppliers, while local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher. The retail food sector has high local-level concentration, with four-firm shares ranging from 63% to 85% in specific market areas. Retail consolidation has led to dairy processors and manufacturers increasing in size and market share to meet demands for lower costs. Concerns about concentration include reduced competition and market power. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors may not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. While efficiency gains from concentration can benefit consumers through lower prices, experts warn that increasing concentration could lead to market power issues in the future. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and retail milk markets, finding that concentration may not impact commodity or food prices significantly. Efficiency gains from concentration were noted, with experts cautioning about potential market power issues in the future. Dairy processors' market power could be balanced by dairy cooperatives, while evidence of noncompetitive behavior was found in some regional retail milk markets. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and retail milk markets, noting efficiency gains from concentration but cautioning about potential market power issues. Experts highlighted concerns about concentration leading to fewer retail outlets and pressure on food processors to consolidate. Some policymakers and industry participants believe concentration weakens price transparency in dairy markets. The move towards a more integrated dairy market with custom contracts and pre-arranged transactions has reduced trades on the spot market, particularly at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Prices set at the CME influence wholesale contracts nationwide, which in turn determine monthly minimum prices for farm milk. Some dairy producer groups criticize the CME for being thinly traded and lacking transparency. Some dairy producer groups criticize the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, and creating a volatile market that adversely affects producers. The GAO found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants claim that any manipulation would be short-lived as large players in the industry monitor the market and would counteract any price manipulation. Despite this, some industry participants want to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce the possibility of manipulation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the CME monitor spot market activities. The CME and CFTC monitor spot market activities for signs of price manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid penalties for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. The CME introduced new futures contracts for skimmed milk powder to manage international dairy risks. Producers and policymakers aim to enhance dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's price reporting system. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition, not individual protection. U.S. antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. Violations can result in fines and penalties. The laws are enforced by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, and individuals can also allege economic injury from violations. The Sherman Act prohibits activities that restrain trade, including agreements among firms not to compete, while the Clayton Act addresses monopolization. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition and allows for premerger notification to examine potential transactions. Violations of antitrust laws can result in fines of up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, or imprisonment of up to 10 years. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect current practices. The premerger remedies DOJ/FTC might seek for a proposed merger include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning federal approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for farmer cooperatives from antitrust liability for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. In April 2009, Dean Foods purchased two plants from Foremost Farms, leading to a civil antitrust suit filed by the DOJ and several states. The suit alleged that the acquisition violated the Clayton Act by lessening competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The DOJ claimed that the elimination of competition between Dean and Foremost would harm school milk and fluid milk purchases. Prior to the acquisition, Foremost Farms had been losing customers to other processors due to their ability to deliver milk to more distant locations. The lawsuit against Dean Foods, following their acquisition of plants from Foremost Farms, aims to force the sale of the dairy processing plants. Dean Foods now holds a significant market share in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and upper Michigan. Despite claims of compliance with antitrust laws and benefits to dairy farmers, the case highlights the impact of consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges conspiracy to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for farmers. The lawsuit alleges that dairy producers in the Northeast must affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood, leading to lower prices for independent producers and cooperatives. DFA claims to increase returns for farmers through efficiencies, but observers predict a lengthy legal process. Another ongoing case from 2008 involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA. Determining the net effect of concentration in the dairy industry is complex due to various factors influencing market power and efficiency gains. These factors include product differentiation, market entry ease, contract structures, technology changes, and government policies, making it challenging to assess the impact of concentration on commodity prices."
