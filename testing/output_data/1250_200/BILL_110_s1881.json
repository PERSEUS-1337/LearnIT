    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, provide broad coverage, and effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the Act's protection, excluding individuals Congress aimed to protect. Congress recognized that physical and mental impairments should not hinder participation in society, but prejudice often prevents talented individuals from doing so. Congress modeled the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 definition of disability on that of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which had a broad conception encompassing actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. The Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline emphasized that society's myths and fears about disability are as handicapping as physical limitations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was based on the broad definition of disability from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Supreme Court's strict interpretation of the term \"disability\" in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams has narrowed its application, contrary to congressional intent. The committee reports that the Supreme Court has limited the coverage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The purpose of this Act is to restore the broad protection available under the original Act and address Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of people protected. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aims to broaden protection for individuals facing discrimination based on actual or perceived impairments, prejudices, or societal barriers. This is in response to Supreme Court decisions that have limited the Act's coverage by excluding those who have mitigated their impairments. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 addresses institutional barriers such as communication, transportation, and architectural obstacles, as well as the need for reasonable modifications and accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 addresses institutional barriers such as communication, transportation, and architectural obstacles, as well as the need for reasonable modifications and accommodations. SEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. It also highlights the discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities and the history of unequal treatment they have endured. Individuals with disabilities face restrictions and limitations in society, leading to political powerlessness. Classifications excluding them should be strongly discouraged and only allowed for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes about disability. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define 'disability' as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The determination of impairment should not consider mitigating measures or their impact. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to treatments, medications, devices, or other measures used to alleviate the effects of an impairment, including accommodations and aids. The term 'mental impairment' refers to any mental or psychological disorder, while 'physical impairment' refers to physiological disorders or conditions affecting various body systems. The term 'mitigating measure' includes treatments, medications, devices, or accommodations used to alleviate impairments. The term 'record of a physical or mental impairment' refers to a history or misclassification as having an impairment, while 'regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' means perceived or treated as having an impairment, regardless of actual presence. SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include discrimination against individuals using mitigating measures as an adverse action.\n\nSEC. 6. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY.\n\nAmends Section 102 to prohibit discrimination based on disability rather than against qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nSEC. 7. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL. SEC. 7. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL. Section 103(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to clarify that discrimination can occur if the individual alleging discrimination is not a qualified individual with a disability. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act for comprehensive prohibition of discrimination. Regulations must be issued within 180 days to implement the provisions of the Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007 requires the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board to issue supplementary guidelines for accessible design. Federal regulations and guidance for the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are entitled to deference by administrative agencies, officers, and courts. The Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007 requires deference to federal regulations and guidance for interpreting the definition of disability in actions brought under the Act."
