The Congress finds that the United States is facing a crisis in writing skills in schools and the workplace, with nearly 1/3 of high school graduates not prepared for college-level English composition. Deficiencies in writing skills result in high private-sector costs for training. Writing is crucial for employment and promotion, and the National Writing Project has shown significant improvements in student writing performance. The National Writing Project is a model for improving teaching in various subjects. Over 135,000 teachers benefit from its programs annually in multiple locations across the United States and its territories. The National Writing Project is reauthorized to expand its network of sites, ensure high quality, disseminate effective practices, and coordinate activities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary is authorized to award a grant to the National Writing Project to improve the teaching of writing in classrooms through teacher training programs. The grant requires the grantee to work with educational providers to establish effective writing teaching approaches and processes. The grantee will use funds to establish and operate teacher training programs, meeting conditions set by the Secretary. The teacher training programs will be conducted year-round, train teachers from kindergarten to college, create a National Writing Project teacher network, and encourage teachers from all disciplines to participate. The Federal share of costs for teacher training programs authorized by the National Writing Project is 50%, with a maximum limit of $150,000 for one contractor or $300,000 for a statewide program. The Secretary can waive this requirement based on financial need as determined by the National Advisory Board. The National Writing Project will establish and operate a National Advisory Board. The National Writing Project will establish a National Advisory Board composed of national educational and writing leaders to advise on student writing issues, review programs, and support development. The Secretary will conduct independent evaluations of teacher training programs. The National Writing Project will establish a National Review Board consisting of leaders in writing research to review programs. The Secretary will conduct independent evaluations of teacher training programs, with funding limitations set aside for this purpose. The National Writing Project will establish a National Review Board to review and recommend applications for funding. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008 with additional funding for the following years."
