    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To improve the generalization and robustness of compact models, introducing noise at input or supervision levels can be beneficial. Variability through noise can enhance model performance, as seen in experiments like \"Fickle Teacher\" using dropout for response variation and \"Soft Randomization\" matching output distribution. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. This study emphasizes the advantages of incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. The design of Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment must consider factors like memory, computation, performance, reliability, and security. Compact models that generalize well are essential for resource-constrained devices and applications with strict latency requirements, such as self-driving cars. It is crucial to evaluate model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to ensure reliability under distribution shift. Additionally, models need to be resilient to malicious attacks by adversaries. In the study, the focus is on knowledge distillation as a method for training a smaller network under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. The goal is to transfer knowledge from the teacher model to the student model to improve performance. Despite promising results, there is still a gap in performance between the two models, and capturing knowledge effectively remains a challenge. The study emphasizes the importance of reducing the generalization gap and making models suitable for real-world deployment. The study focuses on transferring knowledge from a larger network to a smaller model through knowledge distillation. To improve real-world deployment, methods enhancing the student model's robustness to perturbations are crucial. Inspiration is drawn from neuroscience, highlighting the importance of collaboration and cognitive bias in learning. Human decision-making involves simplifications ('heuristics') that may lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Introducing constructive noise in the student-teacher collaborative learning framework can act as a deterrent to cognitive bias, improving learning outcomes by preventing memorization and over-generalization in neural networks. This noise mimics trial-to-trial response variation in humans and enhances model generalization and robustness in knowledge distillation. The study explores the effects of introducing noise in knowledge distillation to improve model generalization and robustness. It includes analyzing various noise types in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework, introducing a method called \"Fickle Teacher\" using Dropout for uncertainty transfer, implementing \"Soft Randomization\" with Gaussian noise for adversarial robustness, and showcasing the benefits of random label corruption in reducing cognitive bias while enhancing robustness. The presence of noise in the nervous system affects its function and has been used as a regularization technique to improve generalization in deep neural networks. Various noise techniques like Dropout and injecting noise to the gradient have shown to be crucial for optimization. Randomization techniques that inject noise during training and inference have been effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smoother ones, improving adversarial robustness. Label smoothing, noise addition, and randomized smoothing have been effective in improving the robustness of classifiers against adversarial attacks. However, label smoothing may impair knowledge distillation. Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework could lead to lightweight models with improved robustness. CIFAR-10 dataset was used for empirical analysis, and the Hinton method was employed to train the student model. Effect of noise addition in knowledge distillation framework using Hinton method to train student model on Wide Residual Networks. Experiments conducted with \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4, normalized images between 0 and 1. Evaluation done on ImageNet images from CINIC dataset, adversarial robustness tested with PGD attack, and robustness to corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C. Different types of noise injection proposed. In the knowledge distillation framework, noise is added to the output logits of the teacher model to improve generalization and robustness. The study shows that signal-dependent noise enhances generalization on CIFAR-10 but slightly reduces out-of-distribution generalization. Additionally, there is a slight increase in adversarial and natural robustness of the models. Our method introduces dropout in the teacher model to add variability in the supervision signal during knowledge distillation to the student model. This approach differs from previous methods that use noise in the teacher model's output logits. Our method introduces dropout in the teacher model to add variability in the supervision signal during knowledge distillation to the student model. This approach differs from previous methods that use noise in the teacher model's output logits. The proposed method uses dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for distilling knowledge to a compact student model, capturing the uncertainty of the teacher directly. Training the student model with dropout significantly improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization over the Hinton method. Adding dropout in the teacher model during knowledge distillation improves generalization for the student model. The method introduces trial-to-trial variability, enhancing both PGD Robustness and natural robustness. By incorporating Gaussian noise in the input image, knowledge is distilled to the student model while maintaining adversarial robustness. This approach combines multiple sources of information, utilizing the teacher model trained on clean images to train the student model with random Gaussian noise. Our method involves training the student model with random Gaussian noise using the teacher model trained on clean images to retain adversarial robustness and mitigate generalization loss. By minimizing a specific loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, we observed a significant increase in adversarial robustness and a decrease in generalization. Our method outperforms compact models trained with Gaussian noise alone, achieving higher adversarial robustness even at lower noise intensity levels. Additionally, it improves robustness to common corruptions. Our method achieves 33.85% compared to 3.53% for the student model trained alone at \u03c3 = 0.05, improving robustness to common corruptions. The robustness to noise and blurring corruptions increases significantly with Gaussian noise intensity. Weather corruptions show improved robustness except for fog and frost, while digital corruption except for contrast and saturation also improves. Changes in effect at different intensities are observed, with lower noise levels increasing robustness for frost. Our regularization technique based on label noise introduces randomness in target labels to enhance adversarial robustness while minimizing generalization loss. By randomly relabeling a fraction of samples in each epoch, the model is encouraged to avoid overconfidence and memorization. This method introduces random label noise to improve generalization, a novel approach not explored before. Studies have focused on improving DNN tolerance to noisy labels, but using random label noise as constructive noise is a new concept. The effect of random label corruption on generalization and adversarial robustness is extensively studied. When corruption is used during knowledge distillation to the student model, generalization improves. However, when corruption is used to train both teacher and student models, generalization drops. Interestingly, random label corruption significantly increases adversarial robustness, with even a small percentage of random labels leading to a notable increase in robustness. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on adversarial robustness and generalization. The teacher model's robustness increases with 5% random labels, reaching 10.89%. Adversarial robustness increases up to 40% corruption and slightly decreases at 50%. Introducing variability in knowledge distillation through noise enhances generalization and robustness. Fickle teacher and soft randomization techniques improve generalization and adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption alone boosts adversarial robustness and generalization. The study suggests injecting noise to increase variability in knowledge distillation for training compact models with good generalization and robustness. Hinton et al. proposed using a final softmax function with raised temperature and smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model. The method involves minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. In real-world scenarios, models often face domain shift, impacting their generalization performance. Test set performance alone is not sufficient for evaluating model generalization. To measure out-of-distribution performance, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset are used. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their deployment. Adversarial attacks on neural networks pose a real threat to their deployment in the real world. Research has focused on evaluating and improving models' robustness against these attacks using methods like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. This attack initializes an adversarial image by adding random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image, adjusting the image in the direction of loss with a step size, and clipping it within the epsilon bound and valid image range. The projection operator clips elements of A within the range [X i,j \u2212 , X i,j + ] and valid data range. Robustness to naturally occurring perturbations is crucial for model performance. Recent studies have shown vulnerabilities of Deep Neural Networks to real-world perturbations. Hendrycks et al. (2019) curated a set of naturally occurring examples that degrade classifier accuracy. Gu et al. (2019) measured model's robustness to minute transformations in video frames, finding state-of-the-art classifiers to be brittle. Synthetic color distortions can serve as a proxy for natural robustness. In their study, researchers found robustness to synthetic color distortions as a proxy for natural robustness. They also emphasized the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness, cautioning against overemphasizing robustness to norm-bounded perturbations. Adversarially trained models may improve robustness to certain perturbations but can degrade performance on naturally occurring perturbations. In the adversarial literature, studies have shown a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. To exploit uncertainty in the teacher model, random swapping noise methods are proposed to improve in-distribution generalization. Two variants are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All, which enhance model performance but may negatively impact out-of-distribution generalization. Training scheme for distillation with dropout involves training the student model for more epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions. Adversarial robustness techniques like noise on supervision from the teacher can improve student accuracy on unseen data but may not enhance generalization to out-of-distribution data. The student model's accuracy on unseen data can be improved with adversarial robustness techniques like noise on supervision from the teacher, but it may not enhance generalization to out-of-distribution data. Various types of noise such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and blur can affect the model's performance."
