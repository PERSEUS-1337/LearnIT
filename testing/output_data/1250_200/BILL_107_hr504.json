This includes coordinating services, building infrastructure for collaboration among providers, and providing new federal resources without replacing existing funding for low-income populations. The \"Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001\" establishes a Community Access Program to provide grants for strengthening services for the uninsured and underinsured. The Secretary may grant funds to develop integrated health care delivery systems serving uninsured and underinsured communities, expanding services, and enhancing efficiency among providers. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit entities like Federally qualified health centers or hospitals meeting specific criteria. The curr_chunk describes eligible entities for grants to develop integrated health care delivery systems serving uninsured and underinsured communities. These entities include public health departments and consortia of providers offering coordinated health care services for specific populations. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an entity must define a community of uninsured and underinsured individuals, identify participating providers, and specify their contributions to care. Preference is given to health care providers identified in paragraph (1). The curr_chunk describes the activities and requirements for a consortium seeking a grant to provide care for uninsured and underinsured individuals in the community. It emphasizes the need for coordinated systems of care, involvement of providers serving the community, and evidence of community involvement. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for a consortium seeking a grant to provide mental health services, including community involvement, enrollment in public insurance programs, revenue leveraging, evaluation plans, fiscal responsibility, and additional information as prescribed by the Secretary. The curr_chunk details the requirements for grant applicants, including the need to demonstrate a commitment to serving the community regardless of ability to pay, priorities for consortiums with public hospitals and providers serving uninsured individuals, and other health care providers with a tradition of serving the uninsured. Grant applicants must demonstrate a commitment to serving uninsured and underinsured individuals, expand preventive and primary care services, improve coordination with social service providers, collaborate with government entities, utilize non-Federal contributions, and show sustainability beyond the grant period. Grantees can use funds for expenses related to integrating a healthcare delivery system, providing a range of services, including substance abuse and mental health services, and expanding patient care within the system. The grantee may use grant funds for various purposes such as increasing outreach activities, improving case management, coordinating transportation to health care facilities, developing provider networks, recruiting and training personnel, acquiring technology, closing service gaps, enhancing provider communication, and other activities to increase access to the uninsured. The grant funds can be used for various activities to increase access to the uninsured, with a limit of 15% for direct patient care. The Secretary can use up to 3% of funds for technical assistance and program extension. Recipients must agree to maintain non-Federal fund expenditures for authorized activities. Participating providers must maintain their non-Federal fund expenditures for authorized activities at or above the previous year's level when applying for grants. Recipients of grants must report annually to the Secretary on progress and provide additional information as requested. Grants may not be renewed without demonstrated progress. Recipients must undergo an independent annual financial audit. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to funded entities. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to funded entities through grants or contracts. $250,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for fiscal years 2003 through 2006."
