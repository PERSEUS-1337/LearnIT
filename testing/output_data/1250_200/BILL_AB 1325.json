    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Delta smelt, a vulnerable species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, has been protected under state law since 1993. Threats to the smelt include habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants. The Delta smelt, a vulnerable species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, faces threats such as habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants. To address the critical condition of the Delta smelt population, a Delta smelt hatchery is proposed as part of a comprehensive strategy for their preservation and restoration. This includes investments to improve habitat conditions and species recovery, ensuring the survival of this key Delta species. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 aims to provide a long-term solution for ecosystem health and species recovery. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 establishes the Delta Smelt Hatchery Program to increase the population of Delta smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta through the use of mitigation banks. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program, developed by the department, aims to preserve and restore the Delta smelt population. It includes establishing a genetic refugia population, developing broodstock for scientific and educational purposes, and providing fish for supplementation of wild populations by identifying suitable sites for a Delta smelt hatchery. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program aims to preserve the Delta smelt population by identifying suitable sites for a hatchery, developing a management plan, establishing a mitigation bank, and adopting guidelines for participation. The department will enter into mitigation banking agreements with partners to provide take authorization for Delta smelt. Agreements must require partners to participate in the mitigation bank proportionally to their impact on Delta smelt and contribute financially to ensure funding for the annual operations of the Delta smelt hatchery. If all requirements are met, the department will issue permits for incidental take to participating banking partners. Delta smelt reared for refugia populations, scientific research, and population augmentation shall count towards mitigation credits. Excess hatchery production creates credits for future activities. Funding for long-term operation and maintenance of the program and a Delta smelt hatchery will come from revenues received from banking partners. Costs for planning, design, and construction of the hatchery will be covered by allocated funds. An audit of all program funds will be conducted every three years. The department is appropriated funds for implementing the Delta smelt hatchery program. They may contract with public agencies for the hatcheries and partner with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Cooperation on long-term Delta ecosystem solutions is required, ensuring compliance with state law for Delta smelt protection."
