    "content": "The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" improves veterans' benefits for former prisoners of war. The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" enhances benefits for former prisoners of war by repealing the minimum period of internment for presumption of service connection for certain diseases and adding additional diseases presumed to be service connected. Paragraph (2) of section 1112(b) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to include new subparagraphs for heart disease, stroke, diabetes (type 2), and osteoporosis. The Secretary can determine additional diseases for presumption of service connection for former prisoners of war based on medical and scientific evidence. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for a presumption of service connection for diseases related to being a prisoner of war based on medical and scientific evidence. Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War and other relevant information will be considered in making determinations. The association between a disease and being a prisoner of war is considered positive if credible evidence supports it. The Secretary will determine if a presumption of service connection is warranted for a disease based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. If warranted, proposed regulations will be issued within 60 days. If not warranted, a notice will be published in the Federal Register with an explanation. The Secretary will issue proposed regulations removing the presumption for a disease not later than 60 days after a determination that the presumption is not warranted. Final regulations must be issued within 90 days of the proposed regulations. Veterans and survivors will continue to receive compensation or benefits if a disease is removed from the regulations. The Secretary will consult with the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War when making decisions regarding entitlement to compensation for veterans with specified diseases. Amendments to section 1112(b) will include prescribed diseases under subsection (d)."
