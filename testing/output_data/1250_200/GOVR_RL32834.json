    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for five years. The program has received multiple short-term extensions since its original funding authority expired in 2002. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend basic TANF funding at current levels through FY2010 and include President Bush's proposal for marriage promotion grants. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend TANF funding through FY2010 and include marriage promotion grants. S. 667 proposes $6 billion for child care, while H.R. 240 proposes $1 billion. The major difference is in the revamping of TANF contingency funds. S. 667 and H.R. 240 would maintain current TANF funding levels without adjustments for inflation or caseload changes through FY2010. The main difference is that S. 667 would overhaul the TANF contingency funds, while H.R. 240 would make minor revisions. Supplemental grants were provided to 17 states to address funding disparities based on population growth and historic grant levels. These grants total $319 million per year and are set to continue through FY2009. Additionally, TANF includes a contingency fund to provide extra matching grants during economic downturns. The TANF program includes a contingency fund to provide extra matching grants to states during economic downturns. Two bills propose revisions to the fund, with H.R. 240 making minor modifications and S. 667 revamping it entirely. S. 667 would base contingency grants on increased cash assistance caseloads and revise the criteria for economic need in a state. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose changes to the use of TANF grants and MOE funds, allowing transfers to other block grant programs. H.R. 240 would raise the overall transfer limit to 50%, while S. 667 would retain the current 30% limit and set the SSBG transfer limit permanently at 10%. Both bills include provisions to ease rules regarding the use of TANF funds. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose changes to TANF funds, allowing states to use carryover funds for any benefit or service. They narrow the definition of \"assistance\" to exclude child care and transportation aid, freeing nonworking families from certain program requirements. Both bills also incorporate the \"universal engagement\" proposal to monitor TANF adult recipients' progress towards self-sufficiency plans. H.R. 240 additionally requires states to end benefits for noncompliance. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose revisions to TANF work participation standards, increasing the required percentage from 50% to 70% and adjusting the hours of work needed for full credit. H.R. 240 also mandates the termination of benefits for families that do not comply with work rules. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to raise the work participation standard for all families to 70% by FY2010 and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. They also propose changes to the credits that reduce these standards, with H.R. 240 revising the caseload reduction credit and S. 667 retaining it. The House bill includes a provision to give additional credit to states with a 60% or more caseload reduction from FY1995 to FY2001. S. 667 retains the current caseload reduction credit for FY2006 and FY2007, but starting in FY2008, it would replace it with a credit for employed welfare leavers. Both bills raise the hours standards, with H.R. 240 setting a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit and providing partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation. H.R.240 and S. 667 both raise the hours standard for TANF work participation. H.R.240 sets a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, while S. 667 provides full credit for single parents with a preschool child at 24 hours per week. Single-parent families would receive full credit at 34 hours per week, with partial credit at 20 hours per week. Two-parent families have higher hours requirements. Core activities such as work, job search, vocational training, and community service count towards meeting the 30-hour-per-week standard. H.R. 240 and S. 667 differ significantly on the types of activities countable as core activities toward the TANF work participation standards. H.R. 240 narrows the list of core activities by eliminating job search and vocational education, giving states almost total discretion to define countable activities. Once the initial months are exhausted, only work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience would count towards the standards. Job search and vocational education would only count during the initial discretionary period. The proposed changes in H.R. 240 and S. 667 regarding TANF work participation standards include giving states discretion in defining countable activities. Both bills allow for additional activities to be counted after meeting core work requirements, with S. 667 offering more options for single-parent families. Job search and vocational education are limited to an initial discretionary period. S. 667 proposes expanded activities for single-parent families on TANF, including education and rehabilitative options. It allows for up to 10% enrollment in undergraduate or vocational programs, participation in rehabilitative activities, and caring for a disabled family member to count as work activities under certain conditions. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, with $100 million allocated for activities such as public advertising campaigns and education on the value of marriage. Additional funds are provided for research and demonstrations, with H.R. 240 emphasizing the use of funds primarily for marriage promotion. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, with $100 million allocated for activities such as public advertising campaigns, education on the value of marriage, and marriage skills programs for various groups. S. 667 includes additional provisions for consulting organizations familiar with domestic violence issues and ensuring that marriage promotion activities are voluntary. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose amendments to TANF provisions, including marriage promotion activities and drug testing for applicants. Positive drug tests could lead to benefit sanctions for up to three years. S. 667 also includes authorizations for additional special-purpose grants beyond marriage promotion. S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose amendments to TANF provisions, including grants for employment programs, domestic violence grants, and tribal welfare programs. S. 667 allows assistance for teen parents not living with an adult for up to 60 days. H.R. 240 funds tribal TANF programs through FY2010 and makes tribal organizations eligible for TANF bonuses.
