The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community,\" \"at-risk forest,\" and \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" as measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and species habitat on Federal lands. This includes activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest for these purposes. Federal lands refer to National Forest System or public lands. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal land is defined as areas where natural fire regimes are crucial for endangered or threatened species, or where wildfire poses a threat to their habitat. Wildfire is considered a threat to endangered or threatened species and their habitats as identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects focus on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels in at-risk forests and endangered species habitats. Projects must enhance protection from wildfires for endangered species and comply with species recovery plan guidelines. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, activities such as timber harvesting, thinning, and grazing are used to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires. These projects aim to move Federal land towards condition class I and do not require revisions to land management plans. The Secretary must review and make a determination on public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened species habitat within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. Public Notice and Comment:\nThe Secretary concerned must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register. The public can submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the initial notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit comments on the final designated project within 30 days. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply if projects involve timber harvesting or grazing, requiring an environmental assessment within 30 days of project notice. Under subsection (a)(1), the proposed agency action must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Failure to meet the deadline specified will result in compliance. For livestock grazing projects, the environmental assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. The Secretary is not required to consider alternatives in the environmental assessment. Compliance with this section fulfills the National Environmental Policy Act requirements. Compliance with this section satisfies requirements of various environmental acts. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows a special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. Judicial review is conducted according to the Act as well. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Before listing species under the Endangered Species Act, research on the impact of listing on forest fuel loads is required. Endangered species recovery plans must include wildfire risk assessments."
