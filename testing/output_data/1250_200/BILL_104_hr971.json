    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\". The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US to preserve and enhance their property value. The value of a home is closely tied to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including water, air, risk of flooding, scenic beauty, noise levels, wildlife, and other factors. The value of homes in the United States can be reduced by certain types of land development and industrial activity. Protecting homeowners from irresponsible actions that harm property values is important for individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Current public information and participation procedures may not adequately inform homeowners about activities that could impact their home values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that could decrease the value of their homes. Within 90 days of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies. These procedures require any person seeking approval for property impacting activities to provide notice. The term \"application to conduct property impacting activity\" refers to requests for permits, licenses, or other approvals that allow activities generating pollutants or adverse impacts affecting the value of private homes. The notice required for property impacting activities must be delivered to homeowners within 1/4 mile of the site. It should also be published in local newspapers and mailed to homeowners likely to suffer a reduction in property value. The notice must describe the proposed activity's impacts on private homes and the public. The agency must provide a toll-free number for homeowners to express concerns about potential property value impacts and request more information on proposed activities. If requested, the agency will thoroughly investigate any potential property value reductions due to the authorized activity. When authorized activities may reduce property values, the agency will investigate and seek alternatives to minimize adverse effects on private homes. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. (a) Right of Action.--Any person conducting an activity authorized by a permit, license, or other approval that generates pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of private homes can be sued by affected homeowners. \n(b) Notice of Intent to Sue and Voluntary Claim Resolution Procedures.--Homeowners must provide a 30-day notice before filing a lawsuit, giving the defendant and relevant agency a chance to resolve the issue voluntarily. In any action under this section, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. Homeowners can file class action suits under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The remedy allows homeowners to recover the amount equal to the reduction in their home's value. The homeowner can recover compensation for the reduction in their home's value caused by certain activities, with a limit based on the median value of nearby homes. They are entitled to attorney's fees and the court may issue an injunction for violations of federal laws. The US district court has jurisdiction over such cases, and frivolous lawsuits may result in dismissal. No action may be brought under this section with respect to any private home or homes after 5 years from the date the total reduction in value reaches $10,000. This Act does not limit anyone's rights to pursue claims under the Constitution or any other law. The Act allows individuals to pursue claims under the Constitution or other laws without the need to start a suit or receive compensation under the Act first. The Act applies to permits, licenses, approvals, contracts, leases, and arrangements issued or entered into by an agency 180 days after the enactment. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"potential to reduce the value,\" \"private home,\" \"reduction in value,\" and \"person.\" The term \"person\" is defined as any individual, corporation, partnership, or other organization excluding government agencies."
