    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funding must be made available for agencies to use. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects, leading to the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 being proposed to Congress. This act required at least one house to vote on presidential rescission proposals. \"Expedited rescission\" was introduced in 2006 to require at least one house of Congress to vote on presidential rescission proposals. In contrast, \"enhanced rescission\" under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 favored the President, making spending reductions permanent unless Congress enacted a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure prompt approval of the President's rescission request. The expedited rescission approach, introduced in 1992, allows the President to propose rescissions from an appropriations act within three days of signing it. The House passed bills in 1992, 1993, and 1994 to expedite the process, with limits on reducing program budgets and expedited procedures for a prompt floor vote. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 1578 allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding with expedited judicial review. H.R. 4600 in 1994 strengthened expedited rescission by allowing submission of a special rescission message at any time. H.R. 4600 in 1994 proposed expedited procedures for rescissions and repeals of targeted tax benefits, with authorization for special messages from the President. Additionally, a draft bill in 2006, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, aimed to amend the Impoundment Control Act to allow the President to propose rescissions of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and repeal of targeted tax benefits through special messages to Congress. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act (LLIVA) allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority, direct spending items, and repeal targeted tax benefits through special messages to Congress. The LLIVA grants the President flexibility in submission and packaging of messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in one message. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction, and adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps must be made within five days of enactment. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures. The President's proposed bill under the LLIVA would be fast-tracked for consideration by Congress. The bill could be introduced within two days, with a vote required by the 10th day of session. Debate would be limited, no amendments allowed, and additional expedited procedural rules detailed for consideration. The President could withhold budget authority for up to 180 days following transmittal of the special message. The President could withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for 180 days, a provision not seen in expedited rescission bills before. Supporters argue it allows temporary withholding until Congress can act on the President's request, while others see it as potentially unnecessary and subject to abuse. They suggest a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to consider a special message. Supporters of the 180-day withholding provision argue that it allows temporary withholding of funds until Congress can act on the President's request. Critics view the mechanism as potentially unnecessary and subject to abuse, suggesting a shorter period for Congress to consider a special message. The bill does not prohibit the President from initiating multiple 180-day withholding periods. Language in the bill allows for early release of funds if the President determines that continuation of the deferral would not further the purposes of the Act. The LLIVA allows for expedited rescission of spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with similar provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including H.R. 2290 which authorizes the President to propose rescissions of \"wasteful\" budget authority. The SLICE Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Mark Udall in the 109th Congress, aims to enable the President to propose spending cuts that Congress must debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for budget authority in appropriations acts. The SLICE Act of 2006 allows the President to propose spending cuts that Congress must debate and vote on. Senator John Kerry introduced a similar bill, S. 2372, which would allow the President to propose cancellations of discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The SLICE Act of 2006 allows the President to propose spending cuts through a legislative line item veto. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667, which includes provisions for identifying limited tax benefits and expedited procedures for congressional consideration. The bill would allow the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions, with one special message allowed per bill. H.R.5667 allows the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions. It includes expedited procedures for congressional consideration and allows for one special message per bill. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee approved the bill, which was later passed by the House. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act with budget process reforms, including a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Stop Over Spending Act, introduced by Senator Judd Gregg, includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act and other budget process reforms. The bill, S. 3521, was marked up by the Senate Budget Committee and some features were modified to limit the President's flexibility. Noteworthy differences exist among various versions of expedited rescission bills, including H.R. 4890 and S. 2381. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 and S. 3521 differ in the deadline for submission of special rescission messages and the number allowed. The House version requires submission within 45 days and allows for more special messages, while the Senate version allows submission up to one year and limits the number of messages. The House version also allows for withholding of funds for up to 180 days, while the Senate version limits it to 45 days. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 differ in the deadline for submission of special rescission messages and the number allowed. The House version requires submission within 45 days and allows for more special messages, while the Senate version allows submission up to one year and limits the number of messages. The House version also allows for withholding of funds for up to 180 days, while the Senate version limits it to 45 days. The House-passed version provides a 45-day extension for a total withholding period of up to 90 days, with a sunset termination date after six years. The Senate version stipulates termination after four years and narrows the range of possible targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 differ in defining targeted tax benefits and the process for identifying them. The House version requires the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to identify such provisions, while the Senate version requires the Joint Committee on Taxation to do so. Additionally, the House version proposes repealing most of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for specific sections, while the Senate version would amend Title X of the Act. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 differ in defining targeted tax benefits and the process for identifying them. H.R. 4890 and S. 2381 would amend Title X of the Impoundment Control Act by replacing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The bills aim to clarify the framework for expedited rescissions and the President's authority to propose rescissions. A manager's amendment added clarifying language regarding cancelled funds from trust or special funds. All changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 differ in defining targeted tax benefits and the process for identifying them. Changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, while a manager's amendment to S. 3521 made changes to the legislative line item veto. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected items, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. Features in S. 3521 remained unchanged, with provisions for expedited consideration of rescission proposals from the President staying similar over the years. Expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days. Earlier bills allowed for consideration of substitute packages or motions to strike specific rescissions. The scope of coverage has expanded to include discretionary budget authority, direct spending, and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 would add transportation projects to possible cancellations available to the President. The Line Item Veto Act in the 109th Congress, H.R. 4699, grants the President broad authority for expedited rescission, including discretionary budget authority and direct spending. The bill includes provisions for expedited judicial review and a severability clause to protect against constitutional challenges. If one provision is found unconstitutional, the rest of the act remains unaffected. The Line Item Veto Act in the 109th Congress grants the President authority for expedited rescission, including discretionary budget authority and direct spending. The President seeks enactment of the LLIVA to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
