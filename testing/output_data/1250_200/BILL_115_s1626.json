    "content": "The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" defines a \"commercial air carrier\" as an air carrier operating under specific regulations. The Act also requires training for responding to smoke or fume incidents on aircraft. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must prescribe regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment for training flight attendants, pilots, maintenance technicians, and airport responders on responding to aircraft incidents involving smoke or fumes. Training includes identifying sources of fumes, recognizing potential hazards, and responding to smoke and fumes on board aircraft. The regulations require training for flight attendants, pilots, maintenance technicians, and airport responders on recognizing and responding to smoke and fumes on board aircraft. Reporting incidents of smoke or fumes to the Federal Aviation Administration is also outlined. The regulations require training for recognizing and responding to smoke and fumes on board aircraft, including reporting incidents to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must develop a standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft operated by commercial air carriers within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. They must also establish a reporting system that allows pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance technicians to submit reports and access a database for reviewing and monitoring incidents. The standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft includes sections for details such as flight identification, type of aircraft, smoke or fire description, fumes details, location, engine information, flight phase, and other observations. The standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft includes details about the flight phase, observations, symptoms reported, oxygen use, effects on flight operation, and post-incident maintenance work. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is required to compile and make these reports available to the public on a quarterly basis after redacting any personally identifiable information. The Administrator must redact personally identifiable information before making forms available to the public. A publicly searchable database on incidents of smoke or fumes on commercial aircraft will be developed, including required materials, crew training materials, and statistics disaggregated by various criteria. SEC. 5. INVESTIGATIONS. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must prescribe regulations for conducting investigations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. Investigations must gather information from various personnel involved in incidents, collect reports, examine technical findings, and identify the cause of the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration conducts investigations to identify the cause of incidents involving missing, failed, or improperly serviced components. They consult with the commercial air carrier, work with technical representatives, and invite collective bargaining representatives to participate. SEC. 6. BLEED AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT. The Federal Aviation Administration will require commercial air carriers to install carbon monoxide detectors on bleed air streams in aircraft within one year. The detectors will monitor carbon monoxide levels during flights and alert the pilot and flight attendants if limits are exceeded. Pilots will be required to report any alarms. The regulations require pilots to report alarms from carbon monoxide detectors activating during flight. Aircraft manuals must include procedures for responding to these alarms. The FAA will continue researching technologies for monitoring bleed air quality. The FAA will continue researching technologies for monitoring bleed air quality, including specific sensors and operational techniques to prevent fume events. This section clarifies that an investigation is still necessary even if a carbon monoxide detector alarm is not activated on an aircraft. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Aviation Administration to carry out the Act, while helicopters are excluded from the provisions of the Act."
