    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001\". It includes findings and purpose. The Congress finds that the Holocaust was one of the most tragic crimes in history, with 6 million European Jews murdered and families destroyed. Holocaust survivors faced challenges in claiming insurance due to lack of documents, leading to the establishment of the ICHEIC in 1998 to address unpaid insurance claims. The ICHEIC was established in 1998 to address unpaid insurance claims issued to Holocaust victims. The United States and Germany signed an Executive Agreement in 2000 to support the ICHEIC in resolving these claims. The deadline for claims applications is January 31, 2002, but companies continue to withhold thousands of names on dormant accounts. As of June 15, 2001, over 84 percent of the 72,675 claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle. Insurance companies in the United States have a responsibility to disclose insurance policies of Holocaust victims to facilitate resolution of claims. State legislatures have faced challenges in implementing laws to compel insurers to publish names of Holocaust-era policyholders. The purpose of this Act is to provide information about Holocaust-era insurance policies to victims and their families. The Act aims to provide information on Holocaust-era insurance policies to victims and their heirs for prompt claims filing. SEC. 3. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY. The Archivist will establish and maintain a Holocaust Insurance Registry containing information provided under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001, accessible to the public. SEC. 4. FULL DISCLOSURE OF HOLOCAUST-ERA POLICIES BY INSURERS. SEC. 4. Insurers must file information with the Secretary of Commerce regarding Holocaust-era policies, including policyholder details and issuing entities. Filing must be done electronically within 90 days of enactment or by January 31, 2002. The Secretary of Commerce will impose a civil penalty of at least $5,000 per day for insurer non-compliance with section 4. Amounts received as penalties may be used by the Archivist of the United States to maintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry. SEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce will notify each State's insurance commissioner of insurers failing to comply with section 4 or pay civil penalties. Upon request, the Secretary will inform state commissioners about non-compliant insurers.\n\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES. SEC. 9. State Holocaust Claims Reporting Statutes. This section addresses the preemption of State laws requiring insurers to disclose information on insurance policies related to victims of Nazi persecution. It also states that if litigation is dismissed due to reliance on this Act, each party should bear its own legal fees. In this Act, the terms \"commissioner of insurance,\" \"covered policy,\" \"insurer,\" and \"related company\" are defined in relation to insurance policies issued to individuals in areas occupied by Nazi Germany or its allies between 1933 and 1945. The term \"related company\" is defined as an affiliate under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."
