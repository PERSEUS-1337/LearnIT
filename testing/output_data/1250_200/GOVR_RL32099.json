Evaluating the effects of permanent tax changes on capital allocation involves measuring the effective tax rate on returns to different assets. This report focuses on estimating the effects of these proposals on the effective tax rate on earnings and comparing tax rates across asset types, organizational forms, and sources of finance. The report focuses on estimating effective tax rates on income from prospective investments, taking into account timing of deductions and the time value of money. Effective tax rates can differ significantly from average tax rates, impacting the allocation and size of the capital stock. The main factor affecting tax burden on new investment is how quickly the cost of the asset is recovered through depreciation deductions. The tax burden on new investment is influenced by how quickly the asset cost is recovered through depreciation deductions. Depreciation matching economic decline can result in taxing investment income at the statutory rate. Inflation can increase effective tax rates, especially for shorter-lived investments, but equipment depreciation tends to lower effective tax rates. The tax burden on new investment is influenced by depreciation rules, particularly for equipment assets, which are deducted over a shorter period than their actual lifespan. Different tax rates can be measured at the corporate level, reflecting the effects of depreciation rules on various asset types. Effective corporate tax rates also consider deductions for interest and individual income taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. Comparing tax rates on corporate and noncorporate investment can show the differential in total tax burden. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize tax rates on different types of capital investment. Before the act, effective tax rates on earnings varied significantly, with equipment assets taxed at less than 10% and buildings at 35-40%. After the act, the statutory rate was reduced to 34%, but depreciation rules changed and the investment tax credit was repealed. After the 1986 Tax Reform Act, equipment tax rates were slightly below the statutory rate at about 32%, while buildings were slightly above it at 35-40%. The rationale for equal taxation is to ensure private markets allocate investment to produce the highest after-tax returns. Tax legislation and economic effects have reintroduced a significant difference between tax burdens on earnings from investments in equipment and buildings. In the 17 years since the 1986 Tax Reform Act, tax legislation and economic effects have increased the difference in tax burdens on earnings from investments in equipment and structures. Bonus depreciation further favors capital allocation to equipment. Legislative changes raised effective tax rates, especially for buildings. In 1993, the top corporate tax rate was raised by one percentage point, affecting most tax rates. The useful life for non-residential buildings was also increased, slightly raising tax rates for affected assets. Overall, tax rates on earnings for all assets decreased due to inflation decline. The 1986 Tax Reform Act led to changes in tax burdens on investments in equipment and structures. Bonus depreciation favored equipment, while legislative changes raised effective tax rates, especially for buildings. The decline in inflation reduced tax rates on earnings for all assets. Effective tax rates for equipment are lower than the statutory rate, while buildings are taxed above it. Mining, farm, and public utility structures receive favorable treatment. Treatment for mining, farm, and public utility structures is generally favorable. Bonus depreciation reduces effective tax rates for equipment, with the 30% bonus depreciation lowering rates from 26% to 20% on average. Debt is favored at the corporate level due to interest deductions, while equity is favored at the individual level with lower capital gains tax rates. Individual taxes on capital returns are reduced as they are imposed after corporate taxes. Individual taxes on the return to capital are reduced as they are imposed after corporate taxes. Recent temporary revisions have lowered tax rates on capital gains and extended them to dividends, favoring equity investment. The effective tax rate on debt vs. equity is complex due to tax-favored individual investments like pensions and IRAs with zero tax rates. Incorporating these effects shows that current tax rates are lower and changes in individual tax rates are less significant. Pension funds and IRA account managers can choose between debt and equity, further complicating the situation. Table 3 presents estimated effective tax rates on debt and equity under various scenarios, including the effects of bonus depreciation. The reduction in the debt-equity distortion is small due to lower individual tax rates and bonus depreciation benefits for both debt and equity. A more meaningful comparison is the tax wedge, where a debt financed return must exceed the after tax return by 19% under current law. The current tax rates create a gap between debt and equity financing, with debt needing to exceed after-tax return by 19% and equity by 82%. The new rates reduce this gap to 52%, a change of 11%. Bonus depreciation has a 7% effect, with a combined change of 15%. When considering pensions and IRAs, the gap narrows further, with a 2% change closing about one thirtieth of the gap. The corporate tax also discourages investment in the corporate sector. The analysis examines the tax differential between corporate and non-corporate investments, considering the impact of debt vs. equity financing and individual tax rates for pensions and IRAs. The reduction in the tax gap is relatively small, regardless of bonus depreciation rules. The analysis suggests a reduction in the tax differential between corporate and non-corporate investments, with bonus depreciation benefiting all forms of business investment. The dividend relief provisions lower the tax rate on dividends to that of capital gains, reducing the favorable treatment of retained earnings. The effective tax rate on gains is lowered due to tax deferral until the stock is sold, estimated at an average of five years. The effective tax rate on gains is reduced by deferring tax until stock is sold, leading to a rate of 18% on average. Approximately half of gains are held until death and not taxed, resulting in a 9% rate. Dividend relief provisions lower both rates to 15%, with capital gains taxed at about 7%. Including assets in non-taxable accounts would reduce distortions. Effective tax rates for new investments need to consider various assets like corporate and non-corporate investments, owner-occupied housing, and business inventories. Business inventories are taxed at higher rates, while owner-occupied housing is not taxed. The effective tax rates depend on individual tax rates and investments in pensions and IRAs. Tax rates are lower with IRAs and pensions, reducing overall effective tax rates on capital by 10% to 15%. Bonus depreciation also plays a role in reducing tax rates. The reduction in individual tax rates by two percentage points to 20% decreases effective tax rates on capital by 10% to 15%. Bonus depreciation further reduces tax rates by 7% to 9% for 30% bonus depreciation and 13% to 19% for 50% bonus depreciation. When combined with rate reductions and 50% bonus depreciation, overall effective tax rates are reduced by a quarter to a third. Bills introduced to repeal the illegal export subsidy provision also impact corporate tax rates. Chairman Thomas's 2003 bill, H.R. 2896, included provisions for shorter recovery periods for manufacturing equipment and extending bonus depreciation. The effects of shorter depreciation lives reduce effective tax rates by about 3-5 percentage points for different bonus depreciation levels. These provisions would have favored manufacturing but had small overall effects on tax burdens due to only covering a portion of equipment assets. The 2003 bill, H.R. 2896, proposed provisions for shorter recovery periods for manufacturing equipment and extending bonus depreciation. Equipment represents about a third of reproducible capital in manufacturing, leading to a 1.5 percentage point reduction in industry tax rates. The overall corporate tax rate would decrease by less than half a percentage point without bonus depreciation. Other provisions in the bill aimed at multinational corporations would lower effective tax rates, with a potential offset due to the repeal of the ETI. Senator Hatch's bill, S. 1495, suggested 100% expensing to reduce equipment investment tax rates to zero, but it would be a temporary extension. The provision in H.R. 2896 for a temporary extension would provide a deduction of up to 10% of income from domestic production, multiplied by the share of total business that is domestic. This would result in an effective tax rate of 32.5% for manufacturing. Additionally, S. 1637 proposed a general rate cut lowering the tax rate on manufacturing by 9%. The proposed rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing to approximately 32%, reducing effective tax rates on manufacturing structures and equipment. This reduction would narrow the difference between equipment and structures, favoring investment in domestic manufacturing. The overall effect on manufacturing plant and equipment investment would be similar to the depreciation provisions in the 2003 Thomas bill at the firm level. The proposed rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing to approximately 32%, benefiting inventories and debt-financed investments. Manufacturing investment would see a reduction in effective tax rate of about 1.5 percentage points. Qualified production activities income allows a deduction of 9% from taxable income, limited to 50% of wages. Production property includes domestic film, energy, construction, and engineering services. The law excludes certain activities like food sales and electricity distribution. The proposed rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing to approximately 32%, benefiting inventories and debt-financed investments. The 50% wage limit excludes sole proprietorships where no wages are paid. The Joint Tax Committee indicated that three quarters of the benefit would have gone to corporations, 12% to Subchapter S firms, 9% to partnerships, and 4% to sole proprietorships. The overall effect on the economy is somewhat larger, perhaps closer to \u00bd of one percent. The proposed rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing to approximately 32%, benefiting inventories and debt-financed investments. The effects of faster depreciation of equipment and a rate cut are similar in size, both reducing taxes in the manufacturing sector. The approaches differ in favoritism for equipment and debt-equity distortion. The Crane-Rangel bill would encourage more investment in the United States. The accelerated depreciation provision would be easier to administer and have more impact on decreasing tax burdens. The 2003 House bill included provisions such as repeal of ETI, extension of bonus depreciation, and reduction of depreciation period for leasehold improvements and restaurants. It also aimed at small businesses with a lower inframarginal corporate tax rate and temporary increase in equipment investment deduction. These provisions would have varying effects on investment. The final legislation included provisions for equipment investment deduction, rate reduction for small corporations, extension of expensing for certain small businesses, and tax reductions on income from overseas investments. Other provisions addressed tax shelter issues, carryovers of losses, alternative minimum tax, and R&D tax credit extension. Overall, the legislation resulted in a $128 billion loss over 10 years. The final bill, S. 1637, focused on foreign tax revisions and was roughly revenue neutral. The 2001-2003 temporary tax cuts had mixed effects on existing distortions. Capital income tax cuts reduce distortions favoring consumption over investment, but their impact on saving is unclear. Dividend relief provision in business capital allocation is seen as most efficient. The temporary tax provisions, such as bonus depreciation, were originally aimed at stimulating the economy in the short run. However, making these provisions permanent may not be efficient in reducing financial or sectoral distortions. The revisions in the bills favor manufacturing and other eligible activities, but the overall effects outside of that sector are minimal. Bonus depreciation, if made permanent, may expand favorable treatment of equipment investments, but it may not be the most effective stimulus in the long term. The effectiveness of temporary investment stimulus like bonus depreciation depends on investors believing it to be temporary. Making it permanent could undermine government credibility and hamper fiscal policy management in the future. Tax revisions can impact revenue base and tax burdens, with some adding to administrative costs. Tax rate cuts focused on manufacturing create classification issues and increase opportunities for tax sheltering. The tax rate cuts within manufacturing may lead to increased administrative costs and tax sheltering opportunities. Calculating tax rates involves determining the required after-tax return and expected asset depreciation rate to break even. Discounting future flows uses a continuous compounding method for analysis. The formula for calculating tax rates involves factors such as pre-tax return, after-tax discount rate, economic depreciation rate, statutory tax rate, and present value of depreciation deductions. It also considers individual level taxes, debt finance, nominal interest rate, dividend rate, growth rate, effective individual tax rate, and effective capital gains tax rate. The total tax rate is determined by the difference between the pre-tax return and after-tax return. The total tax rate is calculated as ( r \u2013 R ) / r, with assumptions including an interest rate of 7.5%, inflation at 2%, and a real return to equity of 7%. The corporate tax rate is 35%, individual marginal tax rate on investment income is 26%, and tax rates on dividends and capital gains have decreased. Data is used to calculate domestic shares of income. The holding period for financial assets is five years, with half held in tax-exempt forms like pensions and IRAs. Data for analyzing the Crane-Rangel bill and controlled foreign corporations were sourced from specific publications."
