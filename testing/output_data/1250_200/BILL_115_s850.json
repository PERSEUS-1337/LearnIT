The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for foreign medical schools to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit Caribbean medical schools receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other foreign medical schools. The attrition rate at Caribbean medical schools is significantly higher than at US medical schools, and residency match rates for foreign trained graduates are lower. In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates were 54 percent, compared to 94 percent for US medical school graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduated students in a foreign medical school are not U.S. residents, and at least 75 percent of students or graduates are not from the U.S. or Canada. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to set criteria for foreign medical schools to qualify for loan programs under part D of title IV, including passing scores for students and expiration of eligibility after a certain date. The Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017 sets an expiration date for eligibility criteria for loan programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The bill states that if a medical school loses eligibility for loan programs, enrolled students can still receive loans until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
