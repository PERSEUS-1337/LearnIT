    "content": "The TEACH Grant program provides grants to students pursuing teaching careers. Recipients must teach in high-need fields for at least four years within eight years of completing their program. Failure to fulfill this obligation results in the conversion of grants to loans. Challenges in administering the program include issues with loan conversions for recipients who fail to submit required paperwork on time. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with loan conversions due to recipients not submitting required paperwork on time. The high expected failure rate raises questions about program efficacy, including issues with program design and implementation. The TEACH Grant program, authorized in 2007, faces challenges with loan conversions and program implementation. Lawmakers may need to address issues like certification challenges and the absence of an appeals process. Proposed changes and legislative history are also discussed. The TEACH Grant program was created in response to a shortage of qualified teachers in public schools, with a need for 2 million new teachers over the next decade. It aimed to address concerns about teacher quality in low-income schools, driven by retirements and new standards. The program aimed to attract high-achieving individuals to meet the demand in these schools. The TEACH Grant program, established under H.R. 2669, aimed to attract high-achieving individuals to the teaching profession in low-income schools by providing financial incentives to offset the lower salaries compared to other entry-level jobs. It focused on providing grants at the beginning of undergraduate or graduate studies to influence career paths and incentivize individuals to pursue teaching. Additionally, the program targeted attracting high-quality individuals to teach in schools and subjects that typically struggle to retain staff. The TEACH Grant program aimed to attract high-quality individuals to teach in low-income schools and hard-to-fill subject areas. Critics argued that the program was poorly targeted, unproven, and financially burdensome. Changes were made under the Higher Education Opportunity Act to improve transparency and accountability. The TEACH Grant program, established under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, aimed to attract high-quality individuals to teach in low-income schools and hard-to-fill subject areas. The program included service-related requirements, allowed recipients to fulfill their service requirement in designated high-need fields, and required the Department of Education to establish regulations for waiving the service requirement under extenuating circumstances. Additionally, the program mandated the submission of a biennial report to Congress on TEACH Grant recipients and the schools and students served by them. Prior to TEACH Grants, the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program was in place to subsidize education costs in exchange for service. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program, authorized in 1986, provided financial assistance to college students preparing to be teachers. Eligible students could receive $5,000 per year for up to $20,000 in exchange for teaching one to two years for every year of scholarship receipt. The program was repealed in 1998 due to being duplicative of other teacher training programs. The TEACH Grant program, eliminated in FY1996 appropriations, was deemed duplicative and costly to administer. Another program, the NSF's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, offers $10,000 scholarships to STEM majors in exchange for teaching in high-need areas for at least two years per year of scholarship. Recipients who do not fulfill their service must repay the scholarship. Service payback programs, such as scholarships at U.S. Service Academies and ROTC Scholarships, require recipients to fulfill military service in exchange for tuition assistance. Boren Scholarships and Fellowships offer financial aid for studying less commonly taught languages in exchange for working in the federal government. NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Awards provide support for biomedical research training in exchange for engaging in health-related research or teaching. The TEACH Grant program provides funding for students pursuing education degrees in exchange for service in education. Eligibility criteria include enrollment in an eligible program, citizenship requirements, and maintaining satisfactory academic progress. To maintain eligibility for the TEACH Grant program, students must meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, including a minimum GPA and passing a minimum percentage of credits. They must not be in default on a Title IV student loan or have any fraudulent Title IV funds. Disqualification may occur for unusual enrollment history or drug convictions while receiving aid. Specific eligibility requirements include enrollment in a TEACH Grant-eligible program at a participating institution. A post-baccalaureate or graduate student at an IHE participating in the TEACH Grant program must be in a TEACH Grant-eligible program of study. Academic achievement requirements include scoring above the 75th percentile on admissions tests or having a GPA of at least 3.25. The TEACH Grant program is the only HEA Title IV program with an academic merit requirement. If a student is a current or prospective teacher applying for the TEACH Grant program to obtain a graduate degree, they must have expertise in a field with a teacher shortage. A student enrolled in a qualifying program may receive up to $16,000 for a bachelor's degree and post-baccalaureate program combined, and up to $8,000 for a graduate degree. Awards are prorated based on attendance intensity. A TEACH Grant provides financial assistance for students enrolled in a Master's degree program on a half-time basis, with an annual award of up to $2,000. Recipients must participate in TEACH Grant counseling, sign an Agreement to Serve, and commit to teaching as a full-time teacher for at least four academic years within an eight-year period at a qualifying school. A \"highly qualified teacher\" (HQT) under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) must teach at a public or nonprofit private school serving low-income students. This includes schools in Title I-A eligible districts with over 30% of children in poverty, as well as educational service agencies (ESAs) meeting the poverty criteria. Schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) or on Indian reservations also qualify. The annual Teacher Cancellation Low-Income Directory (TCLD) lists qualifying schools. Once a recipient finds a vacancy in a high-need field at a qualifying school, they must apply for and accept a qualifying position. To fulfill the TEACH Grant service obligation, recipients must teach in a qualifying position at a school serving low-income students in high-need fields such as bilingual education, mathematics, science, and special education. The fields must be designated as high-need at the time of receiving the grant or when starting to teach. Recipients may need to declare a major depending on their program of study. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach in a high-need field at a school serving low-income students to fulfill their service obligation. They need to provide certification of employment or intention to work in a qualifying position within 120 days of completing their program. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must certify their employment or intention to work in a qualifying position annually to fulfill their service obligation. The annual certification date is standardized as October 31 for all recipients. On November 1, 2018, ED standardized the annual certification date for TEACH Grant recipients to October 31. Grant recipients may have their grants converted to a loan if they do not meet certain conditions, such as not teaching in a qualifying school or field, failing to submit documentation, or not completing the required four years of service within eight years. If recipients cease enrollment in their program, their grant will convert to a loan within one year unless they meet specific criteria. The eight-year period for completing a four-year teaching service obligation begins after enrollment in an eligible program ends. Recipients can request a suspension of this period for various reasons, such as enrolling in another TEACH Grant-eligible program or military service. Service obligations can be canceled in case of death or total disability. TEACH Grant service obligations can be canceled in case of death or total disability. Recipients may also be discharged for military duty exceeding three years. Grants can be received for multiple programs, with four years of teaching service required for each. Institutions must meet general and program-specific eligibility requirements to disburse TEACH Grants. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires institutions to provide high-quality teacher preparation programs with clinical experience, financial responsibility, pedagogical coursework, and supervision services to be eligible for TEACH Grants. Institutions must meet accreditation standards, offer pre-service clinical experience, and provide support services to teachers. The TEACH Grant-eligible programs must offer pedagogical coursework, supervision, and support services to teachers. They should provide a two-year program of study for teacher preparation or a post-baccalaureate program in a high-need field. Additionally, they must have agreements with other institutions offering teacher preparation programs. A post-baccalaureate program in a high-need field must offer pedagogical coursework and support services. It should lead to a bachelor's or Master's degree and be eligible for TEACH Grants. Program administration responsibilities are divided among IHEs, the loan servicer, and ED. The TEACH Grant program involves the ED-contracted loan servicer managing day-to-day tasks, while the IHE determines program eligibility and oversees grant administration. Financial aid offices evaluate student eligibility and provide counseling. The financial aid office evaluates student eligibility for TEACH Grants, provides counseling, disseminates information, and disburses grants. Teacher preparation program staff support in creating awareness about TEACH Grants and help students secure qualifying job placements. IHEs have flexibility in administering TEACH Grants, such as targeting upperclassmen or students in teacher preparation programs. ED contracts with a private entity for federal TEACH Grant administration. The TEACH Grant program is unique in its administration, with many aspects being handled by the ED-contracted loan servicer post-disbursement. The servicer tracks recipients' service obligations, processes annual certification paperwork, reminds recipients of deadlines, and sends notices about potential loan conversion. If grants convert to loans, the servicer also handles loan repayment tracking. The ED-contracted loan servicer manages the day-to-day administration of TEACH Grants, while ED sets program policy, provides guidance, oversight, and monitors compliance. This includes ensuring the servicer communicates with recipients, tracks progress, and converts grants to loans if requirements are not met. Compliance is monitored through monthly reports and program reviews of participating IHEs. The Department of Education (ED) oversees the administration of TEACH Grants, including monitoring compliance through monthly reports and program reviews of participating institutions. Recipient complaints and disputes, such as incorrect grant-to-loan conversions, are addressed by ED. The TEACH Grant program is treated as a federal credit program, with subsidies estimated annually in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The loan subsidy cost of TEACH Grants is calculated based on the estimated long-term cost to the government on a present-value basis. It considers factors like grant-to-direct loan conversion, loan repayment, interest rates, and excludes administrative costs. The subsidy cost reflects the present value of cash flows from the government minus the present value of cash flows to the government, accounting for loan terms and conditions. A positive cost indicates a collective cost to the government, while a negative cost implies budgetary savings through loan repayment. The TEACH Grant program incurs subsidy costs funded through permanent budget authority and administrative costs funded through annual appropriations. Since FY2013, the program has been subject to sequestration, resulting in annual reductions in grant awards. Since FY2013, the TEACH Grant program has experienced sequestration, leading to reduced annual award amounts. Over 300,000 grants totaling nearly $938 million have been disbursed since the program's inception. Recent analyses have highlighted low benefit take-up rates and a high rate of grants being converted to loans. For example, in the 2013-2014 academic year, only 19% of eligible individuals received TEACH Grants, and 63% of recipients had their grants converted to loans by July 2016. The TEACH Grant program has faced challenges such as reduced award amounts due to sequestration. A study found that 63% of recipients had their grants converted to loans by July 2016. Issues related to program design and implementation have led to legislative proposals to address them. These issues include identifying committed teachers, benefit size, finding qualifying teaching positions, and program quality at eligible institutions. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with reduced award amounts, converting grants to loans, identifying committed teachers, benefit size, finding qualifying teaching positions, and program quality at eligible institutions. Concerns exist about the program's effectiveness in identifying individuals committed to teaching, as some recipients have voluntarily converted grants to loans due to no longer intending to teach. Early availability of grants may attract individuals not strongly committed to teaching or teaching in high-need schools. Some individuals who receive TEACH Grants may lack a strong commitment to teaching, especially if they accepted the grant early in their academic career. Restricting TEACH Grants to upperclassmen and graduate students, who may be more committed to teaching, could potentially reduce the conversion of grants to loans. The AIR study suggests that underclassmen tend to change majors frequently and struggle to maintain the 3.25 GPA required for TEACH Grant eligibility. There is no difference in grant-to-loan conversion rates by undergraduate class or graduate school year, except for juniors and first-year graduate students. Data from the Noyce Scholarship study indicates that the scholarship attracts candidates already committed to teaching, but is less effective as a recruitment tool. The Noyce Scholarship is more likely to influence individuals to teach in high-need schools rather than enter the teaching profession in general. A legislative proposal suggests limiting TEACH Grants eligibility to upperclassmen and graduate students to ensure recipients are committed to teaching. Limiting TEACH Grants eligibility to upperclassmen and graduate students may ensure recipients are committed to teaching. However, this restriction could limit the program's ability to recruit individuals who may not have considered teaching as a career. Anecdotal evidence suggests some students accept TEACH Grants for additional education funding without intending to fulfill the teaching service obligation. Additionally, data shows that a significant portion of grant recipients would have exceeded their federal loan limit if their grants were considered loans from the outset. The TEACH Grant program provides up to $4,000 per year for eligible students to cover education costs. The low take-up rate of TEACH Grants may indicate that some students are unable to meet academic requirements or are hesitant about the program's obligations. The financial benefit may not be sufficient to attract students to teaching. The low take-up rate of TEACH Grants may suggest that the financial benefit is not large enough to incentivize students to accept the grant. Research shows that teacher scholarship programs can effectively recruit and retain teachers in high-need schools when the financial incentive offsets the cost of professional preparation. The Noyce Scholarship, for example, provides $10,000 per year and has shown success in placing recipients in high-need school districts. A legislative proposal aims to triple the annual TEACH Grant award to $12,000 but would also increase the service requirement. The legislative proposal aims to triple the annual TEACH Grant award to $12,000, but would also double the service requirement to eight years. This may attract more participants, but failure to complete the service obligation could result in larger loan repayments. The impact on government costs is uncertain, as more participants may increase costs, but if grant conversions to loans remain the same, many individuals may end up repaying larger amounts. Recipients must teach in schools serving low-income students and in high-need fields to fulfill their service obligation. The TEACH Grant program aims to focus federal dollars on producing teachers in schools and fields facing shortages. Despite many schools meeting the criteria, recipients may struggle to find qualifying employment due to lack of vacancies in high-need fields. A study found that 39% of recipients whose grants were converted to loans did not fulfill their service requirement because they were not teaching in qualifying positions. Many TEACH Grant recipients did not fulfill their service requirement due to various reasons such as not finding a job in a high-need field, deciding not to teach in a high-need school, or finding a higher-paying position at a non-qualifying school. The GAO study highlighted challenges in finding and keeping eligible teaching positions, including limited hiring by school districts and the time it takes to secure a qualifying position. Promotions to non-teaching administrative roles in eligible schools do not count towards fulfilling grant requirements. Some legislative proposals aim to expand high-need fields for TEACH Grant service requirements, potentially including early childhood education, technology, engineering, career and technical education, and writing specialist. This could attract more individuals to teach in priority areas, but some fields may not have true shortages in low-income schools. Identifying qualifying early childhood programs could also be challenging for states. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by recipients of TEACH Grants in finding qualifying teaching placements. While some institutions provide support in identifying these positions, there is no central job search tool available. Expanding the types of schools that qualify as eligible teaching placements could potentially address this issue. Expanding the types of schools eligible for TEACH Grants could improve retention rates in the classroom and grant-to-loan conversion rates. Previous programs like the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships did not require high-need schools, but recipients could reduce teaching service length in teacher shortage areas. A study on the North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program, similar to TEACH Grants, found success in requiring fellows to teach only in public schools in North Carolina. The Teaching Fellows Program, similar to TEACH Grants, requires fellows to teach only in North Carolina public schools. A study showed that fellows are more likely to stay in public classrooms for five years or more, but they tend to teach more advantaged students. Expanding the types of schools for service could go against the program's original goal of supporting low-income schools with high-quality teachers. To disburse TEACH Grants, an IHE must offer a high-quality teacher preparation program accredited by an ED-recognized agency or approved by a state, with specific requirements for clinical experience and pedagogical coursework. The program must also provide supervision and support services to teachers. The HEA and regulations do not define \"high-quality\" teacher preparation programs. States must publish report cards on program quality and report to ED. States must develop criteria to assess program quality, identify low-performing programs, and report to ED. In 2014, 12 states identified 45 low-performing programs, with 28 based in IHEs offering TEACH Grants. 22 states have never identified low-performing programs. In 2016, regulations linking program quality to ratings were proposed but not implemented. The regulations under the HEA Title II state reporting requirements required states to assess teacher preparation program performance, including student learning outcomes. Programs identified as low-performing for two out of three years risked losing eligibility for the TEACH Grant program. Arguments were made for and against limiting TEACH Grant eligibility based on program effectiveness. One legislative proposal suggests that teacher preparation programs must not be identified as low-performing to qualify for TEACH Grants, aiming to set a minimum standard without affecting many programs. However, this change could still limit the number of eligible institutions and impact low-income students entering the teaching profession. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) repealed the definition of Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) under the ESEA, impacting the TEACH Grant program. TEACH Grant recipients may now need to meet both state and federal requirements for teacher quality. TEACH Grant recipients must meet state and federal requirements for teacher quality, including a new definition of Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) that includes passing competency tests. Implementation issues include challenges with certification and lack of an appeals process. Recipients must provide certification of employment within 120 days of completing their program. TEACH Grant recipients must provide initial and annual certification of qualifying teaching service, including teaching in a low-income school and meeting HQT requirements. Issues with annual certification have led to problems for recipients, with 64% citing difficulties in submitting paperwork and 41% not fulfilling service requirements leading to grant conversion to loans. The GAO study found that 41% of TEACH Grant recipients whose grants were converted to loans did not fulfill their service requirements due to challenges with annual certification. Anecdotal evidence suggests that students may not fully comprehend the paperwork requirements despite receiving counseling. Additionally, the ED-contracted loan servicer mistakenly converted 2,252 grants to loans due to recipients' lack of understanding or misleading information about certification requirements. The lack of understanding and information about certification requirements for TEACH Grant recipients can lead to their grants being converted to loans. This may happen if recipients fail to certify on time, which results in all their grants being converted into Unsubsidized Direct Loans. Certification documentation must be submitted through mail or fax, making it difficult to verify if the paperwork was received on time, especially during the summer when recipients or school personnel may be on vacation. Recently, the Education Department (ED) established a standardized annual certification date of October 31 for TEACH Grant recipients to certify their qualified teaching service. Additionally, there are proposals to simplify the certification process by requiring recipients to certify their teaching experience within specific timeframes after completing their program of study. Some bills propose simplifying the certification process for TEACH Grant recipients by setting specific timeframes for certification after completing their program of study. Recipients risk grant-to-loan conversion if not compliant, leading to unexpected debt and potential job changes. From August 2013 to September 2014, 2,252 recipients had their grants mistakenly converted to loans due to administrative errors. Changes have been made to prevent these errors, including system checks and manual reviews by the loan servicer. Recipients who fail to submit certification for qualified teaching may also have their grants converted to loans. Starting in January 2019, the Department of Education (ED) established a reconsideration process for TEACH Grant recipients whose grants were converted to loans due to certification paperwork issues. Recipients could request a reconsideration by contacting the ED-contracted loan servicer. As of May 2019, about 38% of the nearly 6,000 applicants had been approved for a reconversion, with less than 0.3% being denied. It is unclear if any additional actions are taken to address credit damage from the conversion. The Department of Education established a reconsideration process for TEACH Grant recipients in January 2019. As of May 2019, about 38% of applicants were approved for reconversion, with less than 0.3% denied. Proposed changes include crediting teaching service during the grant-to-loan conversion, suspending service obligations, and providing credit repair support. Bills are being considered to formalize an appeals process for wrongful conversions and extend service obligations for recipients. Several legislative proposals have been made regarding the TEACH Grant program. Some bills suggest extending the service obligation period for recipients whose grants were wrongly converted into loans. Other proposals aim to amend the program by allowing partial payback based on completed service, similar to the Noyce Scholarship and Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship programs. This change could reduce the financial burden on recipients and encourage more students to participate in the program. One concern with the TEACH Grant program is that concessions like allowing teachers to fulfill their service in new roles may detract from the goal of retaining teachers in low-income classrooms. However, research suggests that allowing opportunities for advancement could increase retention rates beyond the required four years. Opportunities for advancement may increase retention rates among TEACH Grant recipients, potentially extending beyond the required four years. There are proposals to replace TEACH Grants with a new program offering larger loan repayment amounts for teachers in qualifying positions, incentivizing high-quality candidates to stay in the teaching profession. One consideration is that a new program to replace TEACH Grants may increase costs for the federal government. Some bills have proposed eliminating the TEACH Grant program due to concerns that recipients may not fulfill service requirements, leading to a risky financial situation for students."
