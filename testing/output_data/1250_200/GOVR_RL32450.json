    "content": "The maritime industry, including commercial vessels like tankers, bulk carriers, and passenger ships, is regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. There are gaps in regulations, enforcement concerns, and a focus on the environmental impact of the cruise industry. Passenger ships make up 13% of the world shipping fleet, with the cruise industry being a significant contributor to the U.S. economy. The cruise industry, with ships making up 13% of the world shipping fleet, is a major contributor to the U.S. economy. In 2009, it provided $40 billion in benefits and over 357,000 U.S. jobs. However, the environmental impacts of its activities are a concern. The industry has seen a 7.4% annual growth rate in the number of passengers since 1990, with 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The fleet consists of over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. New ships are added each year, larger and more luxurious, with an average size increase of 90 feet every five years. The cruise ship industry faces challenges in managing large volumes of waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are crucial to prevent risks to human health and the environment. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for waste management and enforcement. The 2000 General Accounting Office (GAO) report highlighted issues with cruise ship compliance with environmental regulations, revealing 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. Most cases involved oil or oil-based product discharges, with some intentional and accidental. These cruise ship cases accounted for 4% of the total illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships during the six-year period studied by GAO. In response to environmental concerns, a coalition of advocacy groups petitioned the EPA in 2000 to address pollution by cruise ships. The EPA agreed to study cruise ship discharges and released a report in 2008 summarizing waste streams and findings from data collection activities, especially in Alaskan waters. Options to address ship pollution were identified in the report. The report provides information on cruise ship waste streams and recent data collection activities, focusing on ships operating in Alaskan waters. It discusses the types of waste generated, international and domestic laws addressing pollution, legislative activities in federal and state levels, and efforts by cruise ship companies to prevent illegal waste discharges. Environmental groups have endorsed legislation to strengthen regulation of cruise ship wastes. Environmental groups have endorsed legislation to strengthen regulation of cruise ship wastes, including stricter standards for controlling wastewater and other discharges. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment, such as sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, and air pollutants. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are crucial to prevent threats to human health and aquatic life. Despite their visibility, cruise ships represent a small portion of the international shipping industry, and the waste streams they produce are not unique to them. Cruise ships, although a small part of the international shipping industry, produce various waste streams including sewage, graywater, and solid waste. The concentration of activities in specific coastal areas can have a significant impact on the environment. Blackwater, which is sewage from toilets and medical facilities, can contain harmful bacteria and nutrients that can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are essential to prevent environmental threats. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater, containing pollutants like fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, and oil. This waste can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are crucial to prevent environmental threats. Cruise ships generate large amounts of graywater and solid waste, with graywater being a major source of liquid waste. Solid waste includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can become marine debris and harm marine life. Waste management on cruise ships involves source reduction, waste minimization, recycling, and incineration, with some ash discharged at sea. This waste poses a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries utilizing marine waters. Cruise ships generate large amounts of solid waste, including plastics, glass, aluminum, and paper. This waste is typically treated on board through incineration or pulping, with some ash discharged at sea. The disposal of waste from cruise ships can harm marine life, with each passenger generating around two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day. The amount of waste generated during a one-week cruise on a large ship can reach up to 8 tons. Additionally, cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various onboard activities, putting a strain on port reception facilities. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from activities like photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and chemicals that can harm marine organisms if not managed properly. Oil leaks from engine spaces can also pose threats to marine life and human health. The bilge, located at the lowest part of a ship, can contain harmful substances like oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown. These substances can harm marine life and pose risks to human health. Bilge water may also contain solid wastes, pollutants, and chemicals from cleaning products used in the engine room. Large vessels can generate significant amounts of oily bilge water, which needs to be extracted before discharge to prevent environmental damage. The bilge water on ships needs to be extracted of oil before discharge to prevent environmental damage. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water can harm marine life. Cruise ships and other vessels use ballast water for stability, taken on in one region and discharged in another to compensate for weight changes. This process is crucial for proper ship functioning. Ballast water discharge from ships, including cruise ships, contains biological materials that can introduce invasive species to marine ecosystems, leading to ecological, economic, and public health risks. The economic cost of pest mollusk introduction alone is estimated at $2.2 billion per year in the U.S. Further research is needed to understand the specific impact of cruise ships on this issue. Air pollution from cruise ships is a significant issue, with diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel and emitting harmful pollutants. EPA estimates that ocean-going vessels contribute to nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the U.S. Ships also emit greenhouse gases, making them a major source of air pollution. Further research is needed to determine the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species to marine ecosystems. Ships, including cruise ships, are significant sources of air pollution, emitting greenhouse gases, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides. Environmental pressures on maritime vessels are increasing as states and localities assess their contribution to regional air quality problems. Cruise ship emissions can have a significant impact on local coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn large volumes of waste, producing ash that must be disposed of. Cruise ships, including those that visit coastal areas repeatedly, generate various waste streams that are governed by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets standards for maritime vessel safety and pollution prevention, such as the MARPOL 73/78 protocol. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with its requirements, regardless of where they sail. Ships flagged under MARPOL must adhere to its regulations, regardless of their location. The Convention consists of six Annexes covering various sources of pollution, including oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage, and emissions control. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities, and ratification and implementation by sovereign states are crucial for protecting the marine environment. Annex VI of MARPOL sets limits on emissions from marine vessels and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary and requires ratification by member countries. The United States has ratified most Annexes, with the flag state responsible for certifying compliance. IMO has established other conventions for issues like ballast water management and passenger safety. The United States implements MARPOL through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and regulations. In 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI on air pollution, followed by legislation in 2008 to implement the standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. Amendments to Annex VI were made in October 2008 after international negotiations. The United States implements MARPOL through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), which applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations to implement APPS, separate from other environmental laws. International maritime shipping poses challenges in enforcing MARPOL, allowing countries to verify compliance and detain non-compliant ships. The U.S. can enforce laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. The United States can enforce laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination between multiple agencies is required for enforcement, with the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states involved. The Coast Guard and EPA have regulatory responsibilities, while the Department of Justice prosecutes violations. Other agencies, such as NOAA, have limited roles in enforcing regulations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act (CWA), is the principal U.S. law concerned with limiting polluting activity in the nation's water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls pollutant discharges, including from vessels, requiring permits for discharge. The Clean Water Act prohibits pollutant discharges from vessels without a permit. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt but Section 312 prohibits untreated sewage dumping within 3 miles of shore. EPA and Coast Guard enforce this, requiring marine sanitation devices on vessels to prevent untreated sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs while Coast Guard regulates design and operation. MSDs either hold sewage for disposal or treat it before discharge. MSDs are designed to hold or treat sewage before discharge. Coast Guard regulations cover three types of MSDs for large vessels, including cruise ships. Type II MSDs treat waste chemically or biologically and must meet specific limits. Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment onshore or outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage with chemicals and have specific performance standards. Regulations do not require monitoring or reporting of effluent discharges, with critics pointing out deficiencies in the current regulatory system. The regulations for Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) have not been updated since 1976, lacking requirements for sampling, monitoring, and reporting effluent discharges. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulatory structure for cruise ships and large vessels, as MSD rules only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while NPDES permits for other sources regulate a wider range of pollutants. NPDES permit holders must comply with sampling, monitoring, and reporting requirements, unlike those under MSD rules. The Coast Guard, responsible for enforcing MSD regulations, has been criticized for inadequate inspections and enforcement of sewage treatment equipment on ships. The Coast Guard faces limitations in detecting violations of environmental laws due to factors like focus on safety, limited resources, and lack of surprise in inspections. Since 9/11, more resources have been allocated to homeland security, reducing time for vessel inspections for environmental compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants or comminuting systems. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks. The requirements are minimal and not mandatory in U.S. waters due to non-ratification. Discharges within three miles of shore must be treated, while discharges beyond 12 miles are unrestricted. Vessels can follow less stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with Clean Water Act regulations. Some ships in Alaskan waters use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage. These systems are effective in removing pathogens and pollutants but less so for dissolved metals and nutrients. No-discharge zones can be established to prohibit sewage discharge from vessels within state jurisdiction. To create a no-discharge zone for sewage from cruise ships and vessels, states must apply to the EPA under three categories based on environmental protection needs. Pumpout facilities must be available for safe sewage removal. Designations include protection for environmentally sensitive areas and drinking water intake zones. The EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge, requiring testing of treatment equipment, and imposing uniform requirements. Graywater is not considered a pollutant under federal law, with no separate standards for its discharge. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in the definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. The EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges from commercial vessels, including establishing limits for bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska and EPA have regulations requiring treatment of graywater before discharge into state waters. NOAA can designate Marine Sanctuaries where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA's 2008 general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, contains restrictions on graywater discharges similar to those in Alaskan waters. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA outlined options for addressing graywater discharges from commercial vessels, including setting standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, requiring permits for dumping garbage into ocean waters. EPA issues permits for waste disposal at sea, excluding dredged material. Cruise ships do not need an MPRSA permit for solid waste discharge beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for regulating cruise ship solid waste discharges under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). No MPRSA permit is needed for solid waste discharge beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic anywhere. The EPA and IMO are evaluating options to address solid waste and plastic discharges from cruise ships. The EPA and IMO are evaluating options to address solid waste from cruise ships, including increasing on-board garbage handling technologies, stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and monitoring for no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment/disposal facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management for generators, transporters, and treatment/disposal facilities. Hazardous waste on cruise ships must be identified, stored onboard, and offloaded for recycling or disposal in compliance with RCRA regulations. The cruise ship industry faces challenges in properly identifying waste generators, storers, treaters, or disposers, and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA regulations for generating hazardous wastes from operations like maintenance and passenger services. Uncertainty exists regarding whether cruise ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. Cruise ships, classified as \"conditionally exempt small-quantity generators,\" have less rigorous requirements for hazardous waste management. Releases of hazardous substances from vessels could potentially trigger CERCLA, but it has not been used for cruise ship incidents. CERCLA mandates immediate notification of hazardous substance releases above regulatory thresholds into U.S. waters. EPA has identified 500 hazardous substances with reportable quantities as low as 1 pound. The Clean Water Act prohibits hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships into U.S. waters. The EPA has proposed various options to address hazardous waste on cruise ships, including establishing standards to decrease contaminants and increasing inspections. The Clean Water Act and Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil or hazardous substances from cruise ships into U.S. navigable waters. Vessels must comply with regulations on oil discharge, maintain an Oil Record Book, and adhere to MARPOL Annex I requirements. Ships must comply with MARPOL Annex I regulations, including the Annex I of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), which prohibits oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land. Cruise lines, mostly foreign registered, have limited applicability to APPS regulations due to operating outside U.S. navigable waters. EPA suggested options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The Clean Water Act regulations exempted ballast water and other discharges from NPDES permit requirements, but concerns over invasive species led to a petition to regulate ballast water discharge. EPA rejected the petition in 2003, citing long-standing policy and congressional acquiescence. The EPA rejected a petition in 2003 to regulate ballast water discharge, citing long-standing policy and congressional acquiescence. Despite environmental groups filing a lawsuit, a federal court ruled in 2005 to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting, upheld on appeal in July 2008. The environmental groups challenged EPA's permitting exemption for ballast water discharges, leading to a court ruling that applies to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. In response, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in 2008, applicable to large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, and cruise ships. The permit covers pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. It applies to waters of the United States in all states and territories. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) covers various waste streams from vessel operations, including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) are used to control most waste streams, with specific requirements for ballast water and bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting are also included in the permit. The VGP includes BMPs and numeric effluent limits for certain discharges from cruise ships, such as graywater and pool water. Additional monitoring and reporting requirements are also imposed, with operational limits in nutrient-impaired waters. The permit does not cover sewage discharges or toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships. The 110th Congress considered legislation on ballast water discharge issues in Puget Sound and the Clean Air Act addresses air quality concerns, setting health-based standards and national emission standards. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until February 2003. The EPA set national emission standards for large sources of air pollution, including cruise ships, in 2003. This rule was a result of litigation by the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards for marine diesel engines on large vessels are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards. This regulation is part of several EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act. In 2003, EPA established emissions standards for nonroad engines and vehicles, including smaller marine diesel engines. The agency planned to review technology for large marine vessel engines to set more stringent standards in the future. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in 2004. EPA considered including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for stricter standards. In 2003, EPA set emissions standards for marine engines. The agency planned to consider stricter standards for large vessels in the future. The 110th Congress implemented MARPOL Annex VI for air pollution control from vessels. In October 2008, IMO adopted amendments for global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. EPA updated CAA rules in December 2009 to align with IMO requirements for Category 3 marine engines. The new standards apply to newly built U.S. vessels only. EPA can enforce nitrogen oxide limits on foreign vessels through the APPS. In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA. A treaty amendment to Annex VI will be circulated among IMO members for approval by July 2011, with more stringent emission limitations for ships operating in the area starting in 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, such as the Clean Water Act treating navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as distinct entities. President Reagan signed a proclamation in 1988. President Reagan signed a proclamation in 1988 extending the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. President Clinton later doubled the width of the contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles in 1999. These proclamations did not change statutory definitions. The 1988 presidential proclamation extended the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles, while President Clinton doubled the width of the contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles in 1999. These proclamations did not change statutory definitions. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial sea as 3 miles wide, with the contiguous zone extending from 3 to 12 miles. Limits of jurisdiction are crucial as they determine where specific laws apply, such as the Clean Water Act's regulations on sewage discharges into navigable waters. The Clean Water Act and other regulations govern sewage discharges into navigable waters, oil spills, and ocean dumping within specific jurisdictional limits. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also addresses discharges of oil and noxious substances in navigable waters. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to the significant increase in cruise ship visits during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska waters. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties of $6.5 million for violations in Alaska, including knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances. The company admitted to a fleet-wide practice of discharging oil-contaminated bilge water as part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement involving environmental violations in multiple locations. Public concern about the violations led to the initiation of a program in December 1999 to identify cruise ship waste streams, revealing that waste treatment systems on most ships did not function well. Fecal coliform levels in blackwater and graywater greatly exceeded applicable U.S. Coast Guard standards. This attention to the Alaska issues led to the passage of federal legislation in December 2000. The federal legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in navigable waters. EPA was authorized to set regulations for sewage and graywater discharges. Cruise ships can only discharge treated sewage wastes in Alaska waters while traveling at least 6 knots and 1 nautical mile from shore, with specific limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. Discharges are also allowed within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots. The legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in navigable waters. Vessels with systems that can treat sewage and graywater to a stricter standard are allowed to discharge within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots. The Coast Guard issued regulations in 2001 for oversight and enforcement, including sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems for potential revised standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. EPA conducted sampling of wastewater from cruise ships in Alaska to assess treatment systems and determine the need for revised standards. The data collected showed that advanced treatment systems are effective in treating various contaminants. EPA collaborated with Alaska on plume tracking surveys and studies to estimate dilution of discharges from docked cruise ships. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate the discharge of blackwater and graywater from ships, setting standards and sampling requirements. Effluent standards for large cruise ships were implemented in 2001 for blackwater and 2003 for graywater, with small ships given three years to comply. A scientific advisory panel was also established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. The state of Alaska enacted a law in 2001 to regulate ship discharge, setting standards for large cruise ships in 2001 and 2003. A scientific panel evaluates the law's effectiveness. Large ships have improved wastewater quality with advanced treatment systems, while small ships still exceed pollution standards. Test results showed that concentrations of free chlorine, fecal coliform, copper, and zinc from smaller vessels pose risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay taxes for environmental regulations. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative. In response to a citizen initiative, Alaska enacted legislation in 2009 to give more time for implementing wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships. Other states have also taken action to regulate cruise ship discharges, such as Maine enacting legislation in 2004 for graywater and blackwater discharges. Compliance with discharge requirements and obtaining permits are necessary for cruise ships to operate in state waters. In 2006, California enacted several bills to regulate cruise ship discharges, including prohibiting treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes from being discharged into state waters. California has enacted measures to regulate cruise ship discharges, including prohibiting hazardous waste discharges into state waters. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the industry to adhere to waste minimization practices. For example, cruise lines in Florida must eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste off-loaded in the US annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the US Coast Guard. Washington also has agreements in place with cruise ship associations and ports for waste management practices. In April 2004, Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) allowing cruise ships to discharge treated wastewater into state waters, with no discharge of untreated wastewater or sludge. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue that federal law permits such agreements with stricter requirements. Department of Ecology reported in June 2009 that cruise ships mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater during the 2008 sailing season. The cruise ship industry has adopted waste management practices to protect water quality, including guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater only while underway and at least 4 miles from shore. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association have implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight. The cruise industry has implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight, certified in accordance with the IMO's International Safety Management Code. They are also working on developing technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones, despite industry efforts. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. In collaboration with local governments, cruise industry works to protect natural and cultural assets of destinations, raise awareness on conservation issues, and educate vendors on reducing environmental impacts. CLIA and CI joint initiative in 2006 aimed to integrate sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts for ecosystem protection. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, following environmental violations in the 1990s. The cruise industry has made efforts to improve environmental practices after facing federal enforcement actions in the 1990s. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient, and whether legislative changes are necessary to address gaps in managing cruise ship pollution. EPA has noted that certain waste streams from cruise ships are regulated, but others like graywater may not be adequately addressed. Graywater contamination from cruise ships, including fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics, has raised concerns. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, advocating for new statutory regulations to include uniform discharge standards, waste management procedures, and thorough recordkeeping. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed uniform discharge standards and waste management procedures for cruise vessels, with required sampling, testing, and monitoring. It aimed to prohibit sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges into U.S. waters without compliance with effluent limits. The legislation would also mandate wastewater treatment on cruise ships and enhance federal enforcement. The proposed legislation aims to enforce wastewater treatment on cruise ships, authorize federal enforcement authority, and impose passenger fees for implementation. Industry groups argue that current environmental standards meet or exceed regulations, while states have passed legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges. Congress may need to develop federal legislation to harmonize state approaches, and EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes are also a concern. In 2000, Congress authorized EPA to set standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in 2008, examining various waste streams from cruise ships. The report discusses management of waste streams and potential options to address cruise ship discharges, but EPA has not determined the necessity or feasibility of these options. Harmonizing U.S. laws for jurisdictional terms related to cruise ships is also a key issue. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the need for research to understand waste generation by cruise ships, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies. Research can help prioritize resources to address significant threats posed by vessel pollution. The Commission identified directions for research by Coast Guard, EPA, NOAA, and other entities on the fates and impacts of vessel pollution. Research directions for the Coast Guard, EPA, NOAA, and other entities on vessel pollution include transport processes, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for sludge, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, vessel air emissions, and possible research options identified in the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for monitoring cruise ship discharges to assess current standards and management effectiveness. It also emphasized the necessity for increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard to ensure compliance with pollution prevention measures and proper off-loading of waste. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcing cruise ship pollution regulations are a key concern. The adequacy of the Coast Guard's resources for enforcing cruise ship pollution regulations is a key concern, highlighted by the GAO in their 2000 report. Possible options for enforcement and compliance include improving monitoring and inspections, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, and charging a passenger fee for onboard marine engineers to observe ship waste treatment practices. The process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries is also a challenge, with recommendations for the Coast Guard to work with the IMO to encourage member countries to respond to pollution cases. The GAO recommended that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to encourage member countries to respond to pollution cases and to follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
