    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a preparation made from living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, cells, or tissues. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Unlike chemical drugs, biologics are more complex in structure. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) within FDA regulates traditional biologics, gene therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER include vaccines, blood products, and allergenic extracts. In 2003, responsibility for regulating therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. CDER regulates monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab are used to treat various conditions. Cytokines control the immune system, growth factors regulate cell division, enzymes speed up chemical reactions, and immunomodulators stimulate or suppress the immune system. Biologics, including enzyme inhibitors and immunomodulators, are specialty drugs that require special handling and may be administered via injection or infusion. These drugs, such as Soliris and Vimizim, can be very expensive, with some costing over $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase over 2015. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on \"original\" biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011. Biologics have driven spending in the Medicare Part B program, with a 13.3% annual growth between 2006 and 2014. Biologic drugs are more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada, where the introduction of biosimilars has reduced prices by up to 33%. In Europe, biosimilars have reduced biologics prices by up to 33%, with one drug in Portugal seeing a 61% price reduction. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs by 60% to 90% for consumers. The Act has also helped the U.S. generic drug industry expand by avoiding clinical trial expenses and initial research costs. The Hatch-Waxman Act reduced drug costs by allowing FDA approval of generic drugs, avoiding clinical trial expenses and initial research costs. Generic drugs must demonstrate sameness to the original product to be approved. The biotechnology industry developed biologics like human insulin and growth hormone in the 1980s. Biological products like human growth hormone, alpha interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application under the Public Health Service Act. Chemical prescription drugs are regulated by the FDA through a new drug application or abbreviated new drug application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics or biosimilars. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. In the past, certain biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA instead of as biologics under the PHSA. Insulin, glucagon, human growth hormone, and other natural source biological products were among those regulated as drugs. Despite similarities with biologics, these products were not classified as such by the FDA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars, leading to market competition issues for specialty biologic drug products. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the marketing of biosimilar products starting in 2006. In the United States, FDA approved Omnitrope in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used for approval, but it did not establish a pathway for other biologic drugs. Congress needed to change the law for approval of other biotech products. In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009. This authority allows FDA to collect user fees from industry for these products. The FDA established a new regulatory authority in March 2010 to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009. In order to meet the higher standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. FDA released draft guidance documents in February 2012 based on public input from meetings held in 2010 and 2012. The FDA released draft guidance documents in February 2012 based on public input from meetings held in 2010 and 2012. Final guidance on biosimilars was released in April 2015, with additional guidance available on the FDA's website. Companies seeking to market biosimilar products in the US must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. FDA may require certain studies in the application, and any changes to the manufacturing process must be demonstrated for comparability. Changes to the approved manufacturing process for biologics require a demonstration of comparability to ensure product quality and safety. FDA has approved seven biosimilars in the US, but sales of five have been delayed due to actions by brand-name manufacturers. Patent infringement lawsuits have delayed the marketing launch of three biosimilars. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for anticompetitive tactics to prevent insurers from covering Inflectra. Such practices could impact the sales of another biosimilar, Renflexis. The high costs of biologics have raised interest in the government's role in new therapeutics development. Six of the seven biosimilars were discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is similar to Neupogen by Amgen. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, originally discovered at New York University. In 1998, FDA licensed infliximab to Centocor Inc., later Janssen Biotech Inc. Pfizer's biosimilar Inflectra, made by Celltrion, is sold in the US at a 15% lower price than Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. Another infliximab biosimilar, Renflexis, was approved by FDA in April 2017. The rebate trap is a financial incentive for insurers to prefer higher-priced brand-name biologics over biosimilars. If a biosimilar manufacturer offers a price discount to insurers, the brand-name manufacturer can withdraw rebates, leading to increased costs for patients on the brand-name biologic. This can result in higher total costs for payers even if the biosimilar is 60% cheaper. Strategies are needed to avoid falling into the rebate trap. The rebate trap increases payer costs when switching from branded biologics to biosimilars. Pfizer's lawsuit highlights low adoption of Inflectra, with providers and insurers hesitant to switch from infliximab. Inflectra has only secured 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US since FDA approval in April 2016. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices in the biologics market. J&J raised the price of Remicade and increased government reimbursements, hindering biosimilar competition. J&J denies the allegations, stating they compete on value and price. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, in August 2016. In August 2016, FDA approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, manufactured by Sandoz. Enbrel was originally discovered by scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital and later marketed by Immunex before being acquired by Amgen. Erelzi is approved for all indications of Enbrel, based on clinical data confirming its similarity to the reference product. The Sandoz biosimilar etanercept, Erelzi, has not yet been released for marketing due to a lawsuit by Amgen. FDA approved Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, in September 2016. Amjevita is approved for 7 indications compared to Humira's 10 indications. Amjevita may not be available until 2018 due to patent litigation. FDA also approved Renflexis in April 2017. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, may not be available until at least 2018 due to patent litigation. Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2017 and is being sold at a 35% lower price than Remicade. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the United States. Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira is a top-selling drug in the US and globally. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying the launch of Cyltezo. Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, was approved by the FDA in September 2017. Avastin is also a top-selling drug in the US. The proprietary name, or brand name, is used by companies to market their drug products and is usually capitalized with a superscript R in a circle (\u00ae). The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by the FDA under the PHS Act, including biosimilar and interchangeable products, along with the licensing date. The nonproprietary name, also known as the generic name, is used in drug labeling and scientific literature to identify the active pharmaceutical ingredient. FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2015, finalized in 2017, providing rationale for its naming convention for biosimilars. The FDA guidance on naming conventions for biosimilars in 2017 uses the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" for originator biological products, related biological products, and biosimilar products. The proper name consists of a core name and a distinguishing suffix of four lowercase letters. The core name is chosen by the USAN Council, ensuring safety and consistency. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the same International Nonproprietary Name (INN) designated by the World Health Organization (WHO). FDA is still considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. The World Health Organization (WHO) selects International Nonproprietary Names (INNs) for drugs based on expert advice. The WHO released a Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in 2016 for biosimilar naming, which includes a code to uniquely identify biological substances. Industry groups generally support the shared use of nonproprietary names for biosimilars, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between reference biologic products and biosimilars. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns to the FDA in 2015 about potential confusion with biosimilars' drug substances. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern to the FDA that their naming proposal for biosimilars could lead physicians to believe there are clinically meaningful differences between biosimilars and reference biologics, potentially deterring physicians from prescribing biosimilars and impeding market competition. The addition of unique suffixes to biosimilar names may create a misconception of significant differences between products, despite historical practice of using the same nonproprietary name for biologics with similar identification tests. The addition of unique suffixes to biosimilar names may lead physicians to mistakenly believe in clinically meaningful differences. The term \"identical\" is misused to instill fear and misunderstanding about biosimilars. FDA labeling conveys safety and effectiveness information for prescription drug products. FDA approved labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products, contains essential information for safe and effective use. It is written for healthcare practitioners and includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, adverse reactions, and other necessary details required by the FDA. The FDA released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The labeling may differ from the reference product, and comparative data is not included to avoid confusion. There are differing views on the amount of information in biosimilar labeling, with the generic industry wanting less and the brand-name industry wanting more. The brand-name industry wants more information in biosimilar labeling, while the Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes it is unnecessary and confusing. BIO advocates for transparency in labeling to provide all relevant information to prescribing physicians. The BPCIA will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020, affecting specific biological products. The FDA released draft guidance on the BPCIA provision in March 2016, stating that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with exceptions until March 23, 2020. An application can be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if a biological product in the same class was approved under section 505 by March 23, 2010, but not if there is a reference product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after March 23, 2020, and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. Any pending applications under the FD&C Act for biological products subject to the transition provisions should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. Industry representatives have expressed concerns about delays in the review and approval of competing biological products. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision affects the review and approval of biological products competing with brand name biologics. Any unexpired exclusivity period for approved NDAs would cease to have effect, except for orphan drug exclusivity. Industry groups have raised legal and trade concerns about the FDA's exclusivity policy. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision impacts the approval of biological products competing with brand name biologics. Interchangeable products can be substituted without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with their reference drug. The Hatch-Waxman Act led to cost savings in the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision impacts the approval of biological products competing with brand name biologics. Interchangeable products can be substituted without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. Biosimilars are not structurally identical to their brand-name biologics, making interchangeability assessment a separate process. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. Europe's EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not determine interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability of biosimilar products. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. At least 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA, industry, and Congress agreed on performance goals and the use of fees for prescription drug user fees. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget and were used to increase staff for application reviews. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program under BsUFA I includes fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and assist industry sponsors in developing biosimilar products. Companies can choose to discontinue participation but may have to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for the first application from a small business. The FDA provides information on the amount of fees collected each fiscal year and how they are spent in an annual financial report. The FDA collects BsUFA fees annually and reports on their usage. The program was reauthorized as BsUFA II in 2017 after negotiation sessions with industry and public meetings. Challenges were faced in meeting BsUFA I goals due to staff limitations. The FDA faces challenges in achieving BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to staff limitations. The new hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act aim to strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring practices. Under BsUFA II, supplement and establishment fees have been dropped, while BsUFA Program fees are capped at five per application per fiscal year. The FDA and industry estimate that approximately $45 million will be needed in FY2018 to cover the BsUFA program costs, with a cap of $9 million for adjustments. The federal government focuses more on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more funding towards clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging, with concerns over high pharmaceutical costs leading to scrutiny of the federal role in costly developments. Concern over high pharmaceutical costs has led to scrutiny of the federal role in costly developments. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of new drugs, particularly innovative ones, originate from publicly funded research. For example, a study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities and biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded work. The 2011 Stevens study found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the 348 applications granted priority review, 19% were from publicly funded research. Priority review is for drugs that would be significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The 2011 Stevens study found that PSRIs tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that contributed to new drug classes, such as recombinant DNA technology and gene silencing methods. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies like gene silencing with small interfering RNAs, which enabled the development of FDA-approved products. Without these technologies, many new drugs may not have been developed, impacting the pharmaceutical industry economically. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by the FDA. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes. It was passed in response to deaths from contaminated vaccines. This act predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which did not include biologics regulation. The Biologics Control Act predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required premarket approval for new drugs. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised and recodified the Biologics Control Act, specifying regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for licensed biological products. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) regulates biological products for the prevention, treatment, or cure of diseases in humans. It aligns with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) which defines drugs as articles intended for disease treatment or prevention. The PHSA was amended in 1997 to require a single Biological License Application (BLA) for biological products, replacing the previous two licenses. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) was amended in 1997 to require a single Biological License Application (BLA) for biological products, replacing the two licenses previously needed. The PHSA allows for immediate license suspension in cases of public health danger. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, part of the Affordable Care Act, established a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and authorized the FDA to collect fees. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was transferred to the FDA in 1972 from the NIH Division of Biological Standards. In 1972, regulatory authority for biologics was transferred from the NIH to the FDA. The FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center was split into CDER and CBER. CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging. FDA published an Intercenter Agreement in 1991 between CBER and CDER. Traditional biologics and most biotechnology products are regulated by CBER. In 2002, the FDA announced a reorganization of review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates licensed biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER focuses on traditional biologics like vaccines and blood products. Blood products, including recombinant versions of plasma derivatives, are discussed in relation to biologic drug prices and top-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. The Purple Book is also mentioned."
