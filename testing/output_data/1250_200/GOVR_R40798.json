    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force. It can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, while it may increase if more people start actively seeking employment. During a recession, the unemployment rate can rise even when the economy shows signs of improvement. Employers are cautious about hiring new workers until they are confident in sustained economic growth. Job growth may be delayed as companies first increase production through existing employees and overtime. During a recession, employers may rely on overtime rather than hiring new workers. Job growth may be delayed even when the economy shows signs of improvement. The Current Employment Statistics program is a key source of job data, providing information from nonfarm employers. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses changes in GDP and employment trends to determine recession periods. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with the unemployment rate increasing during and after each recession. The unemployment rate increased during and after each of the 10 recessions experienced by the U.S. economy since World War II. The severity and duration of the recessions varied, with the unemployment rate peaking at the bottom of the business cycle in some instances, while in others it continued to rise even after the recession had ended. After the 10 recessions since World War II, job growth did not immediately follow, with a sustained period of growth only starting after the end of each recession. In most cases, job levels fluctuated for months before steady growth began, taking three to five months in seven recoveries. However, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, job growth was significantly delayed, leading to what was termed as jobless recoveries. Many observers believe the nation is experiencing another jobless recovery, with employment at public and private sector employers failing to show consistent improvement for well over a year since the recession's end. While private sector job growth started in January 2010, fiscal problems in local governments have slowed overall job growth."
