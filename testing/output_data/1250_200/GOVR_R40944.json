    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office offers advantages, such as the ability to file infringement suits and potentially receive statutory damages and attorney's fees. In the case of New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their work to electronic databases without permission. The Supreme Court ruled in New York Times Co. v. Tasini that publishers cannot reproduce freelance works electronically without specific authorization from the authors. This led to many freelance works being removed from electronic databases. Multiple class action infringement suits were activated and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York following the Tasini decision. The Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick case, like the Tasini case, is a class action lawsuit involving individual authors and trade groups suing publishers for reproducing their freelance works in electronic databases without compensation. Litigation requires court certification of the class, and settlement proposals must be approved by the court with the option for class members to object. The plaintiffs, freelance authors, sued publishers for reproducing their works in electronic databases without consent. After the Tasini decision, parties reached a settlement in 2005, categorizing claims for compensation based on copyright eligibility. Category A claims were eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Damages were assigned based on claim type, with Category A claimants receiving a flat fee. The settlement in the lawsuit between freelance authors and publishers categorized claims into three types: Category A for statutory damages, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Each category had a specific damages formula, with Category C claimants potentially receiving reduced compensation if total claims exceeded $18 million. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against defendants in exchange for financial compensation. Objectors raised concerns about the fairness of the settlement, particularly for Category C claimants. The settlement in the lawsuit between freelance authors and publishers categorized claims into three types: Category A for statutory damages, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Objectors opposed the settlement, arguing that Category C claimants were treated unfairly and inadequately represented. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005, but objectors appealed, challenging the fairness of the settlement and the adequacy of representation. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns before oral argument. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns regarding claims of unregistered copyrights in a settlement between freelance authors and publishers. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional, but the court disagreed, stating that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright actions. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright actions, specifically regarding claims of unregistered copyrights in a settlement between freelance authors and publishers. The court held that the requirement of copyright registration prior to an infringement suit is jurisdictional, and because many of the plaintiffs' copyrights were unregistered, the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify the class and approve the settlement. The Second Circuit ruled that due to many plaintiffs' copyrights being unregistered, the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify the class and approve the settlement. Judge Walker dissented, arguing that the copyright registration requirement should be re-evaluated. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case on whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case on whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts the federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The petitioners argued that the copyright registration requirement should be re-evaluated. The petitioners argued that the \u00a7411(a) registration requirement is not a jurisdictional issue, but a mandatory prerequisite to copyright infringement suits. They contended that if the Second Circuit's jurisdictional characterization of \u00a7411(a) stands, it would hinder parties from reaching negotiated settlements involving unregistered works. Respondents argued that \u00a7411(a) is not a jurisdictional issue but a claim-processing rule, citing cases where the requirement was waived. They also claimed that even without original jurisdiction, the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the case. The United States supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, stating that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite, not a limit on subject-matter jurisdiction. The U.S. argued that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite, not a limit on subject-matter jurisdiction, and should be strictly enforced. They believed that non-compliance with the registration requirement did not warrant vacating the district court's judgment. The Court appointed Professor Deborah Jones Merritt as amicus curiae to support the Second Circuit's ruling, stating that the plain language of \u00a7411(a) clearly restricts subject-matter jurisdiction. Professor Merritt argues that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction and serves important public purposes. She believes parties cannot waive this requirement, as it is crucial for fairness in settlements. Additionally, she contends that neither a special rule for settlements nor the supplemental jurisdiction act can cure this jurisdictional defect in class actions involving multiple authors and databases. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that the registration requirement is necessary to protect Internet service providers from copyright infringement claims. They stated that the petitioners' writ of certiorari should be dismissed because there was no case or controversy before the court and no circuit split on the issue of \u00a7411(a) limiting federal court jurisdiction. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Second Circuit's judgment in Reed Elsevier, ruling that \u00a7411(a) does not limit federal court jurisdiction for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. The Court held that the district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement. The opinion clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's power to adjudicate the case. The Supreme Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's power to adjudicate the case, distinguishing between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules or elements of a claim. If Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. The Arbaugh Court clarified that the employee numerosity requirement in Title VII claims is not a jurisdictional limit but a substantive element of the claim for relief. This interpretation was later applied in the Reed Elsevier case regarding the registration requirement in the Copyright Act. The Court rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement is jurisdictional, emphasizing that it grants federal courts adjudicatory authority over registrability issues. The location of \u00a7411(a) in the Copyright Act, separate from provisions granting subject-matter jurisdiction, further supports this interpretation. Additionally, there are congressionally authorized exceptions to the registration requirement for filing infringement suits. The Court clarified that \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement is not jurisdictional and highlighted exceptions to this rule for filing infringement suits. It distinguished its decision in Bowles v. Russell and emphasized that statutory prerequisites like registration are not always jurisdictional. The Bowles case examined a statutory provision requiring parties to file a notice of appeal within 30 days. The Court noted that the limitation for taking an appeal is jurisdictional. The Reed Elsevier Court explained that context is relevant to determining if a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional. The Court found that \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement is not jurisdictional and rejected arguments to the contrary. The Supreme Court declined to affirm the appellate court's judgment on estoppel grounds in the copyright registration case. The Court noted that the parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending the settlement agreement did not create inconsistent court determinations. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioners' arguments on estoppel grounds, stating that it would not create inconsistent court determinations in their favor. The Court did not express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement, and the merits of the settlement will now be considered by the court of appeals. The Court also declined to decide if \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works, leaving this question open for lower courts to consider. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the Court's judgment on \u00a7411(a) as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim. Justice Ginsburg discussed the tension between the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents regarding jurisdictional issues. She suggested that Bowles relied on longstanding Supreme Court decisions, while Arbaugh's bright line rule supports the conclusion that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional. Despite over 200 opinions characterizing \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional, Justice Ginsburg noted that it does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer to the jurisdiction of district courts. Justice Ginsburg argued that Bowles does not apply to the Copyright Act's registration requirement, despite over 200 opinions characterizing it as jurisdictional. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the settlement's merits and objections. If upheld, freelance authors will receive compensation and databases can restore publications. The appellate court may focus on objections to the damages formula, as highlighted by Judge Walker's dissent. The Supreme Court's opinion in Reed Elsevier has implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases, suggesting that even unregistered works may participate in settlements and lawsuits. The decision also addresses the issue of favoritism towards A- and B-class claim holders over C-class claim holders in class action settlements. Reed Elsevier decision impacts copyright infringement cases involving unregistered works and clarifies federal courts' jurisdiction on class action settlements. The case reaffirms the clear statement rule for statutory limitations and limits Bowles to historically jurisdictional situations."
