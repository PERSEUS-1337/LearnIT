    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act\" and includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, purpose, definitions, general rule, applicability, preemption, jurisdiction of Federal courts, and effective date. The Congress finds that multiple punitive damages for harms arising from a single act may deprive defendants of assets, impact settlements, and result in unfair punishment for the same conduct. The concern over multiple imposition of punitive damages is raised by federal and state judges, commentators, and legislators due to its potential violation of constitutional rights and hindrance to global settlement negotiations in repetitive litigation. Limiting multiple punitive damages awards could aid in resolving mass tort claims involving numerous injured claimants, as trial courts lack the authority to prevent subsequent awards in other jurisdictions. State legislatures can only offer a partial solution as they cannot control punitive damages in other states. The purpose of this Act is to address the issue of multiple punitive damages in interstate commerce. Punitive damages are defined as awards meant to punish or deter certain behavior. Specific findings of fact focus on a defendant's conscious indifference to safety. The term \"claimant\" includes individuals bringing civil actions, their decedents, and parents or guardians in cases involving minors or incompetents. SEC. 6. GENERAL RULE. Punitive damages are generally prohibited in civil actions if they have already been awarded against the defendant for the same act. However, punitive damages may be awarded if substantial new evidence of additional wrongful behavior is presented or if the previous award was deemed insufficient to punish or deter similar behavior in the future. The court may impose limitations on the award of punitive damages in such cases. Punitive damages awarded in civil actions must adhere to limitations set by the court, including making specific findings to support the award, reducing the amount based on previous awards for the same conduct, and prohibiting disclosure of the court's actions. SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY; PREEMPTION; JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL COURTS. This Act applies to civil actions seeking punitive damages for the same conduct, except for damages awarded under specific statutes. It supersedes any Federal or State laws on punitive damages recovery. Federal courts do not have jurisdiction over civil actions under this Act. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to pending and future civil actions, including those where harm occurred before the enactment date."
