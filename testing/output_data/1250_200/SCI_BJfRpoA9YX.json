    "content": "The proposed generative model architecture aims to learn representations for images that separate object identity from attributes. This allows for manipulation of image attributes without changing the object's identity. The model successfully synthesizes images with and without specific attributes and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. The model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks using latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs. The latent space learned by these models is organized linearly, allowing for semantic changes in images by manipulating the latent space. This can be useful for image synthesis, editing existing images, and synthesizing avatars. Class conditional image synthesis is also an avenue of research for latent space generative models. The text discusses the use of latent space generative models for image attribute manipulation, aiming to synthesize images with only one element or attribute changed. This differs from fine-grained synthesis as it focuses on editing specific attributes, like changing a person's expression in a face synthesis task. In this paper, a new model is proposed for image attribute manipulation using latent space representation to separate attribute information from facial representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset, achieving competitive classification scores. Key contributions include a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder and an extensive quantitative analysis of loss components. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow for synthesis of new data samples. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound on data generation. The model presented in this paper demonstrates successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. The distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing is discussed. Code to reproduce experiments is provided. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) consist of neural networks with learnable parameters trained to maximize the evidence lower bound on data generation. The encoder predicts \u00b5\u03c6(x) and \u03c3\u03c6(x) for a given input x, and new data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from a prior distribution and passing them through the decoder. VAEs offer both a generative model and an encoding model, useful for image editing in the latent space. Samples from VAEs are often blurred, but an alternative generative model can produce sharper images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a sharper image synthesis alternative to VAEs. GANs consist of a generator and discriminator trained using convolutional neural networks in a mini-max game. The generator aims to confuse the discriminator by synthesizing samples that are indistinguishable from real data samples. The vanilla GAN model lacks a straightforward method to map data samples to latent space, but there are GAN variants that involve learning an encoder model. The vanilla GAN model lacks a simple way to map data samples to latent space. While some GAN variants involve learning an encoder model, only one approach allows for faithful reconstruction of data samples. This approach requires adversarial training on high dimensional distributions, which remains challenging despite proposed improvements. Instead of adding a decoder to a GAN, an alternative latent generative model combining a VAE with a GAN is considered. This setup allows the VAE to learn an encoding and decoding process, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality output. Various suggestions exist on combining VAEs and GANs, each with different structures and loss functions, but none are specifically designed for attribute editing. Image samples from a vanilla VAE or GAN depend on the latent variable z drawn from a specified random distribution. Conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples, allowing for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to inputs. A more advanced approach involves conditional autoencoders that output both a latent vector and an attribute vector for attribute editing. Conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples by appending a one-hot label vector to inputs. A more advanced approach involves conditional autoencoders that output both a latent vector and an attribute vector for attribute editing. However, incorporating attribute information in this way can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. The proposed 'Adversarial Information Factorization' process aims to separate information about attributes from a latent vector using a mini-max optimization involving an encoder, auxiliary network, and input data. This process is designed to accurately predict attributes from the latent vector and ensure that the latent vector contains no attribute information. The proposed method aims to train an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately from a latent vector, ensuring that the latent vector does not contain attribute information. This involves factorizing label information out of the latent encoding using an adversarial approach within a VAE-GAN architecture. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for predicting attributes from a latent vector. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute and latent vectors. Parameters are updated using a loss function involving binary cross-entropy. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder for attribute manipulation. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for attribute manipulation. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder. The model incorporates a VAE with information factorization and a GAN architecture for classification. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for attribute manipulation. Training involves promoting the auxiliary network to make incorrect classifications, resulting in attribute manipulation through a 'switch flipping' operation in the representation space. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model simplifies attribute manipulation by using a 'switch flipping' operation in the representation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted, including an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture. The model is further enhanced with residual layers for competitive classification results. Qualitative results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in image attribute editing. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model improves visual quality using residual networks. It quantifies reconstruction quality and attribute manipulation effectiveness through classification scores on edited images. Smaller reconstruction error and larger classification scores indicate better control over attribute changes. The IFcVAE-GAN model quantifies reconstruction quality and attribute manipulation effectiveness through classification scores on edited images. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. Removing the Information Factorization term in the encoder loss function results in the model failing to perform attribute editing. Including a classification loss on reconstructed samples has not been used in the VAE literature before. The curr_chunk discusses the IcGAN approach in conditional image synthesis and its comparison to the model proposed in the study. The model aims to factorize identity and facial attributes in images by minimizing mutual information between them. The model shows potential for facial attribute classification. The model presented in the curr_chunk focuses on separating facial attributes from identity representation for facial attribute classification. It outperforms a state-of-the-art classifier in some categories and remains competitive in others, demonstrating effective factorization of attribute information. Additionally, attribute manipulation involves reconstructing input images for different attribute values. The curr_chunk discusses attribute manipulation using a cVAE-GAN model, highlighting its limitations in editing desired attributes. The need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality is emphasized. The model's performance is compared to a state-of-the-art classifier in facial attribute classification. The model, IFcVAE-GAN, outperforms the naive cVAE-GAN BID3 in attribute manipulation, achieving a 98% success rate in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute. The model maintains good reconstruction quality while changing desired attributes, as shown in Figure 3. The IFcVAE-GAN model outperforms the naive cVAE-GAN in attribute manipulation, achieving a 98% success rate in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute. The model can change desired attributes while maintaining good reconstruction quality. The IFcVAE-GAN model successfully factors attributes from identity, demonstrated through an ablation study and competitive scores on a facial attribute classification task. Adversarial training is used to factor attribute label information out of the encoded latent representation. The IFcVAE-GAN model incorporates factorization of attribute label information into the encoder of a generative model. Unlike other models, it predicts attribute information and can be used as a classifier. This approach minimizes mutual information via adversarial information factorization, similar to cVAE-GAN architecture. The objective is to manipulate single attributes of an image, such as making \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\", which requires a different type of factorization in the latent representation. The model focuses on attribute editing in images, highlighting the difference between category conditional image synthesis and attribute editing. It emphasizes the need for specific changes to attributes with minimal impact on the rest of the image, unlike changing categories which may result in more noticeable changes. The model also learns a classifier for input images and aims to preserve identity in the latent space. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images, emphasizing the need for specific changes to attributes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. The approach involves factorizing label information out of the latent encoding to successfully edit attributes. The model utilizes latent space generative models for semantically meaningful changes in image space, differentiating from image-to-image models. By performing factorization in the latent space, a single generative model can edit attributes by changing a single unit. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images using factorization in the latent space to edit attributes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. The approach involves a single generative model that can edit attributes by changing a single unit of the encoding. The model aims to learn disentangled representations and allows for modifications of elements in images, demonstrated on human faces but applicable to other objects. The paper focuses on attribute editing in images by using factorization in the latent space to change attributes without affecting the object's identity. They propose a model called Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, which separates the object's identity from its attributes for accurate editing. The model outperforms existing models for image synthesis and is effective as a classifier. The study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method for facial attribute classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the residual network architecture and the need for L aux loss for good reconstruction quality. Small amounts of KL regularization are necessary for good reconstruction. Results show that small amounts of KL regularization are needed for good reconstruction, with models without L gan having slightly lower error but blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can accurately edit attributes but with poor visual quality, showcasing the main contribution of factored attribute information. Various models can learn factored representations from unlabelled data, with evaluation done through a linear classifier on latent encodings for facial attribute classification. Our classifier, E y,\u03c6, is compared to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE model, known for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
