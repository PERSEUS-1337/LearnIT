    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration made multiple requests throughout 2007, with Congress expected to consider the remaining requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In October 2007, Congress approved emergency defense and international affairs funding. The Army and Marine Corps faced financial strain due to high operations in Iraq, draining their base budget quickly. Without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. The Defense Department considered options to extend operations, including transferring funds from other accounts or slowing peacetime activities. The Defense Department considered various options to extend military operations, including invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act\" or using other measures. A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the funding issue, providing most of the requested amount for Army and Marine Corps operations. Funding from the FY2008 appropriations act is estimated to last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operations. Operations could be extended further by slowing obligations or transferring funds from other accounts. The Defense Department considered options to extend military operations, including invoking the Feed and Forage Act or transferring funds. The Administration requested $141.7 billion for Defense, $3.3 billion for State Department, and $325 million for other agencies in FY2008 emergency supplemental funding. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act. The White House requested additional funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including $5.3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and $45.9 billion for various activities related to ongoing conflicts. The total request was $195.6 billion, with $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs. The Administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008, with $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense for military operations and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs. Congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, leading to the approval of a compromise bill providing $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.1 billion for international affairs, and $14.5 billion for domestic programs. The FY2008 emergency supplemental funding included $14.5 billion for domestic programs, in addition to defense funding and a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" from the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Congress quickly provided funds for MRAP vehicles and debated measures for partial year funding for overseas operations. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill was approved in November 2007, providing $460 billion. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, was signed into law, providing $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. A separate bill, H.R. 4156, allocated $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with provisions for troop withdrawal from Iraq within 30 days of enactment. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of legislation that required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces to force protection, training, and pursuit of international terrorists. The Senate also rejected a substitute bill that provided $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. In November 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that without additional funding, the Army would have to cease operations at all bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to the Army and Joint IED Defeat Organization to extend operations until February 23. Senior defense officials continued to urge Congress for additional funding to avoid halting essential operations. On December 17, 2007, the House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for various programs. A second amendment allocated $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mainly for Operation Enduring Freedom. The Senate later approved the House-passed bill on December 18, 2007. On December 18, 2007, the Senate approved $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the funds could be used. The House then approved the Senate amendment, clearing the bill for the President to sign into law on December 26, 2007. This resolved a funding dispute that had threatened Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The Defense Department planned to shut down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008 due to a lack of funding. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of furloughs for civilian and contractor personnel. However, emergency supplemental appropriations of $70 billion averted the shutdown until at least June 2008, providing enough funds to sustain operations until the end of June for the Army and the end of August for the Marine Corps. The Army and Marine Corps operations were projected to last until the end of June 2008 and end of August, respectively. The Army will deplete its military personnel funds by mid-June, potentially extending operations by transferring funds from other accounts. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to sustain operations. The Defense Department has the authority to transfer funds from various accounts to extend Army operations for up to another month without slowing down operations. This could reduce financial flexibility for other needs. Congress provided a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund, but the underlying controversy remains. The Defense Department may rely on regular defense appropriations to finance day-to-day activities and war-related operations in the absence of supplemental appropriations. The Defense Department may extend Army operations for up to another month by transferring funds without slowing down operations, reducing financial flexibility. Congress provided a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund, but controversy remains. Regular defense appropriations finance day-to-day activities and war-related operations without supplemental appropriations. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, provides regular and emergency funds for international affairs, including $6.9 billion requested by the Administration. The bill allocates $1,473.8 million for programs, with $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for other purposes. Concerns arise over potential disruptions from using the Feed and Forage Act to finance military operations and Navy/Air Force funds supporting Army operations, impacting congressional controls on fund usage. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, with $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for other purposes. Supplemental funds include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, $12.0 million for International Broadcasting, and funds for various international programs such as Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, and Migration. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, with $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for other purposes. Supplemental funds include $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. The House bill compared funding to the request in a summary table in the Appendix. The original House-passed bridge fund, H.R. 4156, required a plan to withdraw most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. The final $70 billion emergency funding legislation includes reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. The $50 billion bridge fund approved by the House on November 14, 2007, required the President to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within 30 days of enactment, with a target date of December 15, 2008, for completion. It allowed a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups, along with readiness requirements and extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies. The House-passed bridge fund, H.R. 4156, required the withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. It extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies and set conditions for deploying units abroad. The bill aimed to bring troops home quickly and safely, with a goal of transitioning to a limited presence by December 15, 2008. The transition in Iraq involved protecting U.S. facilities, armed forces, and civilians, providing training to Iraqi security forces, and conducting counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports were required on the transition, with a comprehensive regional stability plan due by February 15, 2008. Additional quarterly reports were mandated to establish performance measures for stability in Iraq. Senators proposed shifting the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi forces by the end of 2008. The Senate failed to approve a bridge fund amendment expressing the sense of Congress to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The vote was 50-45, with 60 votes required, reflecting no change in Senate support for the war in Iraq. Earlier, Senators proposed a similar amendment. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. Instead, a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" was approved for FY2008, requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide regular reports on progress in Iraq, including criteria for safe troop withdrawal. The Administration requested a total of $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008. This included funds for military operations abroad, emergency funds for international affairs programs, and additional funding for various agencies. Additionally, budget amendments were sent to Congress for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle procurement and deployment, as well as for military operations abroad and international affairs programs, totaling $189.3 billion. The Administration requested $45.9 billion in FY2008 for military operations abroad and international affairs programs, totaling $189.3 billion. The funds were designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps in the congressional budget resolution. The Senate may exceed spending limits by designating funds for ongoing war-related expenses as \"emergency\" appropriations. S.Con.Res. 21 allows for up to $124.2 billion in adjustments for overseas deployments. Supplemental appropriations bills often provide more funding than requested by the White House and can include significant legislative initiatives. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, and the SCHIP children's health insurance program, as well as a measure to increase the minimum wage. The FY2008 continuing resolution, attached to the defense appropriations bill, provided additional funding for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, and other non-defense programs. The FY2008 continuing resolution included $2.9 billion for veterans health programs, $3 billion for community development in Louisiana, $2.9 billion for FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and $500 million for wildfire management. Congress provided $16.8 billion for MRAPs in previous resolutions and defense appropriations bills. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill allocated $11.6 billion for MRAPs as emergency appropriations. The omnibus appropriations bill included a $70 billion bridge fund with $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill includes $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, $11 billion for Navy, Air Force, and other components, $1.35 billion for Afghan security forces, $1.5 billion for Iraqi forces, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, $4.3 billion for joint IED defense, and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. Up to $4 billion can be transferred between accounts in the bridge fund for future operations financing. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 continues a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for the Defense Department. The funding for war-related expenses has significantly increased since FY2003, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007. These increases are mainly for repairing or replacing equipment lost in military operations and upgrading ground forces. The largest funding increases have been for weapons procurement, reaching $64 billion in the amended FY2008 request. Operation and maintenance funding has also grown to repair equipment, along with funding for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi military forces. The Defense Department has seen increases in funding for repairing equipment, training Afghan and Iraqi military forces, and reorganizing the Army. Congress insisted on adding funds for new equipment and reconstitution of the force. The term \"reconstitution\" refers to repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat to restore the force to its pre-war condition. The term \"reconstitution\" refers to repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat to restore the force to its pre-war condition. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" to describe returning the force to a condition it would have been in without conflict, potentially reducing funding requirements. The Defense Department now uses \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades and substantial improvements to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps. The upgrades for Army and Marine Corps equipment include fixing shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping deploying units with newer weapons and support systems. Congress generally supports upgrading ground forces, with some questions raised about specific equipment requests. The Administration withdrew requests for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a V-22 tilt rotor aircraft to realign funding for the troop surge. The budget amendment included $6.3 billion for maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq and $1 billion for Iraqi security forces. The October 22 budget amendment allocated additional funds for Iraqi security forces, reopening factories in Iraq, and constructing facilities and roads in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also included $8.8 billion for repairing and replenishing equipment, $1 billion for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment, and $5.4 billion to restock equipment inventories of combat support units. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives such as fuel price increases, construction of facilities, improving Army medical facilities, and soldier and family support programs. Additionally, the Administration sent a regular FY2008 budget of $35.1 billion for international affairs and an emergency supplemental request of $3.301 billion. This was later amended with an additional $3.596 billion in spending. The Administration requested a total of $6.897 billion for international affairs in FY2008, with the largest portion allocated for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs for various programs in countries such as Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Two-thirds of the State Department request was for Diplomatic and Consular Program funding for Iraq Operations. Foreign Operations comprised $3.678 billion, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Step 1 - The Bush Administration requested $350 million for P.L. 480 food, with a significant portion allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Critics argue that the Administration relies too heavily on supplementals, while the Administration defends the necessity of emergency requests for unforeseen expenses. In February 2007, the original FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq, and $53 million for Contributions to International Organizations. \nStep 2 - The Administration requested $6.897 billion for international affairs in FY2008, with a focus on State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nStep 4 - The Bush Administration requested $350 million for P.L. 480 food, with a significant portion allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Critics argue that the Administration relies too heavily on supplementals, while the Administration defends the necessity of emergency requests for unforeseen expenses. In February 2007, the original FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq, and $53 million for Contributions to International Organizations. The supplemental request for FY2008 for the State Department's Administration of Foreign Affairs totaled $3.220 billion, including funds for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The Mission in Iraq involves 1,000 direct-hire Americans from 12 U.S. government agencies. The Department requested $2.283 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, with $2.120.6 billion designated for emergency needs in Iraq. Security needs in Iraq accounted for $978.7 million, covering various aspects such as local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, and physical and technical security measures. The Administration requested $907.1 million for Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq, covering salaries, operations, living accommodations, security, and other support. Additionally, $162.4 million was sought for worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan, including securing facilities, high threat protection teams, and fully armored vehicles for the embassy and PRTs. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State included funding for various expenses such as security costs, armored vehicles, staff housing in Afghanistan, U.N. activities related to combat terrorism, and international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State, with $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA), which was less than the Administration's request. The $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs includes $575.0 million for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. $162.4 million is still pending for security protection in Afghanistan. $550.4 million is allocated for a new peacekeeping mission in Darfur. $390 million is for Darfur and $78 million for U.N. Peacekeeping funds. $333.6 million is still pending for Darfur. $12.0 million is allocated for international broadcasting. The emergency supplemental request for Foreign Operations totaled $3.678 billion, with specific allocations for Economic Support Funds in Iraq, Afghanistan, West Bank, Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Anti-narcotics funding for Mexico and Central America was $734 million, while Migration and Refugee Assistance totaled $230 million mainly for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. International Disaster and Famine Assistance included $80 million for programs in Iraq to assist internally displaced persons. The request for International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) is $80 million to aid internally displaced persons in Iraq. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service. A $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid will support programs in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, Sudan, and a $30 million contingency fund for future needs. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, with some amounts less than requested. For example, $115 million was approved for Global Health & Child Survival. The Administration received supplemental funds approved by Congress for various purposes including Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. No funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America, and the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly $42 billion had been appropriated for Iraq reconstruction until the passage of the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill. In FY2008, $4.9 billion was requested for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for training and equipping Iraqi troops under the Department of Defense. Funding for Iraq reconstruction mainly came from emergency supplemental measures, as Congress rejected the Administration's request for security assistance in the regular Defense budget proposal. The request for DOD reconstruction appropriations totaled about $3.7 billion, primarily for training and equipping Iraqi troops. This funding includes reconstruction grants provided under the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP), which allows military commanders to support various economic activities at the local level. The CERP also funds infrastructure efforts such as electric generators and sewer systems. Additionally, the budget revision added $100 million for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq, funded at $50 million, aims to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. However, the program faces challenges such as lack of electricity and investment from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request includes $1.2 billion for Iraq, with funding allocated to various assistance programs. The ESF is the main source of funding for assistance provided by Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq, including newly established ePRTs embedded with U.S. combat battalions. These teams support local economic projects, job training, and capacity building for local government officials. ESF also supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts in Iraq. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request, with proposed authorization for a new Iraq enterprise fund. The Administration is looking to establish a new Iraq enterprise fund based on successful models from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, supporting private sector growth. While some funds have been successful, others have struggled due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Critics question the funds' effectiveness, as their development goals may conflict with profit motives. The INCLE account would focus on rule of law and corrections programs, including funding for prison construction. The Administration's request for Iraq reconstruction includes funding for prison construction, judicial reform, and anticorruption efforts in the provinces. Additionally, funds are requested for addressing the refugee crisis in the region. Congress has provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction out of the $3.7 billion Defense appropriations supplemental request. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid out of the Administration's $3.7 billion Defense appropriations supplemental request for Iraq. However, Congress rejected most economic assistance to Iraq, only approving funds for humanitarian programs such as demining, refugee assistance, disaster relief, and war victims fund. In total, Congress appropriated 24% of the total International Affairs budget supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction. Congress appropriated 24% of the total International Affairs budget supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction, bringing funding since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The Administration is seeking additional emergency aid for Iraq and Afghanistan's political transition faced challenges in 2006. In Afghanistan, political stability has been achieved through the adoption of a new constitution and successful elections. Personal freedoms have increased, especially for women in the northern and western regions. Despite progress, the insurgency led by the Taliban remains a significant threat to peace and security. Reconstruction efforts have been slow, and government authority struggles to reach rural areas and provinces, particularly in the south. The Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan poses a threat to peace and security, with slow reconstruction efforts, corruption, and challenges in extending government authority into rural areas. Concerns have been raised about the distribution of reconstruction funding, while narcotics trafficking and independent militias continue to resist counter-measures. Some Taliban commanders operate from across the border in Pakistan, beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. Efforts such as the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions, while stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government and combating the insurgent challenge. The international community has been running PRTs to secure reconstruction in Afghanistan, but weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance in FY2008. The total request for reconstruction was later amended to $839 million, including provisions to stabilize Afghanistan and continue economic reconstruction efforts. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded most government operations, including emergency funds for military operations in Afghanistan. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with allocations for democratic governance, reconstruction efforts, and investment in basic social services and economic growth in Afghanistan. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure in Afghanistan, including power sector and road projects. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in economically isolated areas. $5 million in Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) was also requested to support Afghan leadership. The Government of Pakistan has a FATA Sustainable Development Plan with a five-year $750 million development proposal. The State Department and USAID have proposed a $750 million development assistance strategy for the FATA region over five years. The plan aims to improve economic and social conditions to combat terrorism. Programs include governance, health, education, and economic development. After President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in 2007, the US announced a review of assistance but took no action. In 2008, Pakistan held credible elections, leading to the removal of coup-related sanctions by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lifted coup-related sanctions on Pakistan after a democratically elected government took office. The US requested $60 million in emergency supplemental funding for Pakistan to fulfill a $150 million pledge, focusing on governance, health, education, and economic development. Additionally, the US sought $868.6 million in emergency supplemental funding for Sudan, mainly for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. In 2007, the Administration requested $868.6 million in emergency supplemental funding for Sudan, with most allocated for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. This included $70 million for upcoming national elections as part of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimated the election costs to be nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. Additionally, $723.6 million was allocated for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). In the Consolidated Appropriations, $468 million was appropriated; $333.6 million remains in the pending FY2008 emergency supplemental. The emergency supplemental request included $550 million for the Mexico and Central America Security Initiative to address criminal gang and drug trafficking activities. Mexico would receive $500 million for border security technology and transport for law enforcement. Central America would get $50 million to improve border security and deter smuggling. Regular funding for Mexico was $65.4 million in FY2007 and a requested $45.1 million in FY2008. In FY2008, regular funding for Mexico totaled $65.4 million, while Central America received $134.8 million. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million for the Palestinian Authority government, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. This request was in addition to $77 million from the regular FY2008 budget. The funds would address governance, health care, job creation, infrastructure, trade, investment, agriculture programs, and provide budget support. Additionally, $25 million in INCLE funds would be used for training and equipping the Presidential Guards and National Security Force, and $35 million in MRA funds for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank. In FY2008, regular funding for Mexico totaled $65.4 million, while Central America received $134.8 million. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million for the Palestinian Authority government, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. Congress allocated $542.6 million in emergency ESF funds, with $155 million for the West Bank and Gaza. The Administration proposed $106 million in ESF funds for North Korea as part of the Six Party Talks agreement. North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for assistance from the U.S. and other members. The U.S. committed to providing $106 million in assistance to North Korea, with $25 million authorized in FY2007 and the remaining $81 million to be provided in FY2008. The aid package also includes $350 million for emergency food needs in Darfur, Chad, and other regions, as well as $230 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million designated for Iraqi refugees. In FY2008, $195 million was requested for humanitarian assistance to Iraqi refugees, an increase of $160 million. Additionally, $35 million was requested for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon. $200 million was appropriated for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million allocated for Iraqi refugees. $30 million remains pending for Iraqi refugee assistance in the FY2008 supplemental request."
