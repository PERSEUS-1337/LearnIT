    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Carbon Conservation Act\" and includes a Carbon Sequestration Program. The International Carbon Conservation Act establishes a Carbon Sequestration Program through an implementing panel within the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Project sponsors can submit carbon sequestration proposals to the panel, which includes representatives from various government agencies and NGOs with expertise in carbon sequestration practices. The program focuses on projects located outside the United States. The Carbon Sequestration Program, established by the International Carbon Conservation Act, defines a carbon sequestration project as one located outside the US, lasting at least 30 years, designed to increase carbon sequestration, and accepted by the implementing panel. Project proposals must include a needs assessment and identify benefits under specified criteria. The Carbon Sequestration Program, established by the International Carbon Conservation Act, defines a carbon sequestration project as one located outside the US, lasting at least 30 years, designed to increase carbon sequestration, and accepted by the implementing panel. Project proposals must include a needs assessment and identify benefits under specified criteria, including compliance verification and sponsor agreements for project implementation. The assessment for a carbon sequestration project is developed by the project sponsor in collaboration with various organizations and third-party verifiers. The project sponsor must agree to carry out carbon sequestration practices that provide additional carbon sequestration and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases over a 30-year period. The carbon sequestration project sponsor must verify compliance with the approved project proposal by providing third-party verification, including annual audits, site inspections every 5 years, and random inspections. Criteria for evaluating the benefits of carbon sequestration practices will be developed by the Chief of the Forest Service in consultation with the implementing panel. The implementing panel will develop criteria for prioritizing and evaluating carbon sequestration practices in projects to determine their acceptability. The criteria will ensure that carbon sequestration investment credits are not allocated to projects focused on commercial timber growth or replacing native ecological systems. Projects will be prioritized based on native forest preservation, reforestation of former forest land, biodiversity enhancement, and greenhouse gas emissions prevention. Under the carbon sequestration program, guidelines will be established for quantifying the amount of carbon sequestered by projects, including methods for measuring carbon sequestration and ensuring project duration. Guidelines will be established for measuring carbon sequestered, ensuring project duration, verifying additional sequestration, evaluating displacement of deforestation, and promoting sustainable development. The Chief of the Forest Service will consult with experts and use reported information to develop these guidelines. Under the carbon sequestration program, entities specializing in carbon storage verification and measurement will use information reported to the Secretary of Energy from projects under the voluntary reporting program. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish verification standards, and the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration will develop forms to monitor and report on carbon sequestration improvements. The implementing panel will report on carbon sequestration improvements, project sponsors' practices, and compliance with project approvals. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. The Export-Import Bank of the United States can provide financing for carbon sequestration projects outside the US, covering up to 75% of the project costs. Additionally, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation can offer investment insurance for such projects if deemed consistent with relevant regulations."
