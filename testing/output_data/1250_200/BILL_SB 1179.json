    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include definitions related to public cemetery districts, active militia, armed services, domestic partners, and board of trustees. The curr_chunk defines terms related to family members, firefighters, interment rights, and nonresidents within cemetery districts. The curr_chunk introduces definitions related to nonresidents, peace officers, principal county, and voters. It also outlines regulations regarding interment rights, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and specific family members in order of priority. Additionally, it clarifies that the chapter does not restrict the movement of remains within the same cemetery or removal by a cemetery district with proper authorization. The cemetery district must maintain records of removal of remains, including details like date, name, age, cemetery, and reinterment information. The person removing remains must provide a complete record to the cemetery district. An interment right allows transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records, with the ability to designate who can be interred in the plot. The owner must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase, and compliance with state and local laws is required for use of the interment right. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. A surviving spouse, child, or heir can waive their interment right for another relative. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership based on an affidavit, they are not liable unless they had actual knowledge of false information. When a person claims to be the successor owner of an interment right, they must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. Upon purchasing a plot in a cemetery, the district must inform the buyer about interment rights, succession rules, and district policies. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
