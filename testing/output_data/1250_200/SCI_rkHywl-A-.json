    "content": "Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for decision making, but often requires extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning eliminates the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still relies on a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning aims to automatically acquire rewards but struggles with large, high-dimensional problems. The proposed AIRL algorithm offers a practical and scalable solution based on adversarial reward learning, capable of recovering robust reward functions for learning policies in varying environments. Deep reinforcement learning has reduced the need for feature engineering but still requires manual reward function specification, which can be challenging. Inverse reinforcement learning offers a potential solution by inferring expert reward functions from demonstrations. However, deep RL algorithms are sensitive to factors like reward sparsity and magnitude, making well-performing reward functions difficult to engineer. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) BID19 BID14 involves inferring an expert's reward function from demonstrations, offering a potential solution to the challenge of reward engineering. While IRL methods may be less efficient than direct imitation learning BID10, they can be preferred in scenarios like re-optimizing rewards in new environments BID7. Adversarial IRL methods BID6 show promise in tackling complex tasks by adapting training samples for improved efficiency. However, IRL remains a challenging and ill-defined problem due to the multitude of optimal policies and rewards that can explain a set of demonstrations BID15. The maximum entropy IRL framework handles ambiguity in optimal policies, but distinguishing true rewards from shaped ones is challenging. To address this, adversarial IRL proposes learning disentangled rewards that are invariant to changing dynamics. This algorithm enables simultaneous learning of reward and value functions for generalizable and portable rewards. Our method, Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL), aims to recover a generalizable reward function efficiently. Experimental results show AIRL outperforms previous IRL methods on complex tasks with unknown dynamics. Compared to GAIL, our approach excels in environments with variability, effectively disentangling expert goals from environment dynamics. Imitation learning methods aim to learn policies from expert demonstrations, with Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) inferring the expert's reward function. The maximum causal IRL framework removes ambiguity between demonstrations and expert policy, casting the reward learning problem as a maximum likelihood problem. Our proposed method is similar to algorithms by BID21; BID10 BID5, but differs from Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) as it focuses on recovering reward functions. GAIL aims to recover the expert's policy only, which is less transferable. Our IRL algorithm builds on the adversarial IRL framework proposed by BID5, focusing on learning cost functions with neural networks. Previous methods have used boosting and Gaussian processes but still face the feature engineering problem. The proposed algorithm is ineffective due to high variance when operating over entire trajectories, but can be extended to single state-action pairs. The proposed algorithm, based on maximum causal entropy IRL framework, struggles with high variance when operating over entire trajectories. Extending it to single state-action pairs is possible, but a simple unrestricted form of the discriminator faces reward ambiguity issues. This limits the generalization capability of the method, making it difficult to infer agents' intentions and adapt to environment changes. Overcoming these challenges is discussed in Section 5. The standard reinforcement learning setup involves the Markov Decision Process (MDP) with state and action spaces (S, A), a discount factor \u03b3, unknown dynamics T, initial state distribution \u03c10, and reward function r. The goal is to find the optimal policy \u03c0* that maximizes the expected entropy-regularized discounted reward. Inverse reinforcement learning aims to infer the reward function given demonstrations from an optimal policy. The IRL problem involves finding the optimal policy \u03c0* by solving a maximum likelihood problem. BID5 propose optimizing this as a GAN problem, with a trajectory-centric formulation. The discriminator updates the reward function, while the policy updates the sampling distribution. An optimal reward function can be extracted from the optimal discriminator, leading to the recovery of the optimal policy. This approach is known as generative adversarial network guided cost learning (GAN-GCL). In GAN-GCL, the formulation involves optimizing the IRL problem by finding the optimal policy through a trajectory-centric approach. The algorithm efficiently solves imitation learning but is less effective for reward learning due to high variance estimates. The advantage function supervises each action based on the action taken. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of using a heavily entangled reward for reward learning, which may not be robust to changes in environment dynamics. It also explains why IRL methods can fail to learn robust reward functions, highlighting the concept of reward shaping and the class of reward transformations that preserve the optimal policy. The curr_chunk explores policy invariance in IRL methods and the impact of shaped reward functions on dynamics. It demonstrates how changes in environment dynamics can break policy invariance, emphasizing the importance of robust reward functions. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of \"disentangled\" rewards in reinforcement learning, where a reward function is defined to be disentangled with respect to a ground-truth reward and dynamics. It also touches on the importance of removing unwanted reward shaping and the training process involving expert data in reinforcement learning. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions for isolating reward functions in reinforcement learning and the implications of learning state-only rewards. It also highlights the importance of disentangling rewards from dynamics and the limitations of traditional reward learning methods. In reinforcement learning, isolating reward functions is crucial for learning state-only rewards. The method proposed involves modifying the discriminator to include a shaping term, allowing for disentangled rewards from environment dynamics. This approach alternates between training the discriminator and updating the policy to confuse it, resulting in rewards solely based on the state. In reinforcement learning, the method involves modifying the discriminator to extract rewards disentangled from environment dynamics. The approach aims to learn state-only rewards by incorporating a shaping term in the discriminator. The algorithm is evaluated in transfer learning scenarios to test robustness to changes in environment dynamics and scalability to high-dimensional tasks. The algorithm presented focuses on learning state-only rewards by modifying the discriminator in reinforcement learning. It shows that rewards learned under specific constraints produce optimal behavior, outperforming na\u00efve methods. Additionally, it compares favorably to other imitation learning algorithms in both traditional and transfer learning setups. The algorithm GAIL BID10 does not recover disentangled reward functions, hindering re-optimization under environmental changes. Trust region policy optimization BID20 is used for continuous control tasks, while soft value iteration is used for tabular MDP tasks. Expert demonstrations are obtained without revealing the ground truth reward to simulate RL without manual reward engineering. MaxEnt IRL is first considered in a toy task with randomly generated MDPs. In a toy task with randomly generated MDPs, MaxEnt IRL is used to compare learned rewards with ground truth rewards. Results show that AIRL with a state-only reward function recovers the ground truth reward, while AIRL with a state-action reward recovers a shaped advantage function. Transfer learning experiments demonstrate that the state-only reward achieves optimal performance under a new transition matrix, while the state-action reward only marginally improves over a random policy. Learning curves for these experiments are also shown. In transfer learning experiments on continuous control tasks, rewards are learned via IRL on the training environment and used to reoptimize a new policy on a test environment. Two IRL algorithms, AIRL and GAN-GCL, are trained with state-only and state-action rewards. Results for environment transfer experiments are provided in TAB2, including a task involving a 2D point mass navigating a maze with changing walls. Only AIRL trained with state-only rewards is successful in this task. In transfer learning experiments, AIRL trained with state-only rewards successfully navigates a maze with changing walls. In a second task, AIRL enables a quadrupedal \"ant\" agent to adapt its gait when two front legs are disabled and shrunk, while other methods fail to move forward. In transfer learning experiments, AIRL demonstrates the ability to learn disentangled rewards for navigating a maze with changing walls and adapting a quadrupedal \"ant\" agent's gait when two front legs are disabled. Other methods fail to perform well in these tasks. In transfer learning experiments, AIRL shows the capability to learn distinct rewards for maze navigation and adapting a quadrupedal \"ant\" agent's gait. Evaluation against GAN-GCL and GAIL on benchmark tasks with 50 expert demonstrations reveals negligible performance difference between AIRL and GAIL. Both methods achieve close to optimal results, challenging the belief that IRL algorithms are less efficient than direct imitation learning algorithms. The GAN-GCL method is ineffective on tasks that require transfer and generalization, as the discriminator easily overfits and provides poor learning signal for the policy. In contrast, AIRL outperforms GAIL by recovering disentangled rewards that transfer effectively in the presence of domain shift. AIRL is a practical and scalable IRL algorithm that greatly outperforms prior imitation learning and IRL algorithms by learning rewards that transfer effectively under variation in the underlying domain. In small MDPs, AIRL can recover ground-truth rewards up to a constant, matching the objective of solving the maximum causal entropy IRL problem. The method uses a trajectory-centric formulation similar to GAN-GCL, deriving everything in the undiscounted case. The goal of IRL is to train a generative model over trajectories, computing gradients with respect to \u03b8 and using a separate importance sampling distribution \u00b5(\u03c4) for drawing samples. The choice of distribution follows BID5, using a mixture policy to reduce variance.

BID5 suggests using a mixture policy to reduce variance, justified by poor coverage of the policy over demonstrations in early training stages. The new gradient incorporates a rough density estimate trained on demonstrations to improve importance sampling. The policy trajectory distribution factorizes, and in AIRL, the cost learning objective is replaced with training a discriminator to minimize cross-entropy loss between expert demonstrations and generated samples. The policy optimization objective is replaced with a new reward function. The text discusses training the gradient of the discriminator objective and the policy objective in the context of IRL. It explains the relationship between the two objectives and how they are optimized to achieve the global minimum.

The cost learning objective is replaced with training a discriminator to minimize cross-entropy loss between expert demonstrations and generated samples. The text discusses the decomposability condition in the context of training the gradient of the discriminator objective and the policy objective in IRL. It defines the condition for states to be \"1-step linked\" and the transitivity property. This condition allows for the decomposition of state-dependent functions. The decomposability condition in training the gradient of the discriminator and policy objectives in IRL requires all states in the MDP to be linked. This allows for the decomposition of state-dependent functions, ensuring that learned rewards are disentangled. The decomposability condition in training IRL ensures that learned rewards are disentangled. Theorem 5.1 shows that state-only learned rewards guarantee disentanglement with dynamics models. In this section, it is proven that AIRL can recover the ground truth reward up to constants if the ground truth is only a function of state r(s). The optimal policy involves taking a specific action repeatedly for infinite positive reward, and optimizing the reward on a new MDP results in a different policy due to infinite negative reward when visiting a certain state."
