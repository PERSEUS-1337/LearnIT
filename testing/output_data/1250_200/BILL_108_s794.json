    "content": "The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" may be cited as the Act. It includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" includes phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. Higher standards can also be set by regulation. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" increases fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, setting minimum standards of 17 to 19 miles per gallon for different model years. The fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles are set to increase over different model years, ranging from 17 to 27.5 miles per gallon. If the Secretary does not increase the standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not doing so. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE.\n\n(a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the weight limit to 12,000 pounds. Section 32908(a)(1) is also amended to raise the weight limit to 14,000 pounds.\n\n(b) Passenger Automobile.--The definition of a passenger automobile is revised to include vehicles with a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less. The definition of an automobile is expanded to include vehicles with a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less, designed for transporting persons but with certain exclusions such as vehicles with load carrying devices, seating capacity over 12 persons, or cargo areas exceeding 6 feet in length. The amendments made by this section apply to these definitions. The amendments made by this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act, with a focus on accessibility of the cap from the passenger compartment. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under title 49, United States Code. The penalty amount is now $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is used to adjust penalties for violations of fuel economy standards. Amendments to the penalty structure include removing certain subparagraphs and applying changes to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on the preparation of the biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing accuracy. The Secretary of Transportation will submit the first biennial report on testing quality to Congress in 2005. A study will be conducted to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for highway, urban, and combined use. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of the Act, detailing determinations and comparisons of automobile fuel economy ratings. An estimate of the average adjustment to fuel economy ratings will also be included in the report. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy ratings within 180 days after submitting a report to Congress. This procedure aims to closely align ratings with the most accurate testing process determined. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for determining average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. This procedure will be based on the most accurate testing process identified in a report. Additionally, each average fuel economy standard under section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, will be adjusted for improved accuracy in calculating automobile fuel economy. The Secretary of Transportation will adjust average fuel economy standards in title 49, United States Code, to reflect improved accuracy from a revised testing procedure. The standards will be at least as stringent as those under the previous testing procedure. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, sets fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. Additionally, regulations will require at least 20 percent of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executives to be exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles. The President will require that a minimum of 20% of passenger automobiles leased or purchased by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
