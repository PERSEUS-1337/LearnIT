    "content": "Section 5(e) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. Additionally, the Act authorizes Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science (PALS) as described in section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science (PALS) under section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include a program to award grants to high-need local educational agencies for access to laboratory science. Grants are awarded based on merit and require partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of the cost of activities carried out using amounts from a grant under this section shall not exceed 33 percent. A high-need local educational agency approved for a grant application can receive grants for 3 fiscal years. To be eligible for a grant, the agency must submit a plan developed with experts in laboratory science and classroom instruction. The plan for carrying out the program under this section must describe how laboratory improvements and instrumentation align with State academic standards in math and science. It should also outline how these enhancements contribute to a comprehensive program to improve the quality of instruction in math, science, engineering, and technology, with a focus on clear learning outcomes, integration with classroom instruction, and ongoing student involvement. The plan for the program must align laboratory improvements with State academic standards in math and science. It should enhance instruction in math, science, engineering, and technology, with a focus on learning outcomes, integration with classroom instruction, and student involvement. Grants awarded under this section must describe professional development for teachers, safety requirements, maintenance of facilities, and assessment methods to expand research literature on student understanding and achievement in science. Grants awarded under this section must be used to supplement existing programs and improve secondary science education by enhancing laboratories and providing instrumentation. Activities should align with State academic standards and focus on improving the quality of math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. This includes developing a plan for laboratory improvement, purchasing necessary equipment, and ensuring consistency with academic achievement standards. Grants awarded under this section must be used to supplement existing programs and improve secondary science education by enhancing laboratories and providing instrumentation. Activities should align with State academic standards and focus on improving the quality of math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. This includes purchasing equipment, professional development for teachers, curriculum development, laboratory safety training, and hands-on experiences to engage students. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act aims to support individuals in STEM fields and prepare them for postsecondary studies. Grants awarded under this section cannot be used for constructing new facilities. High-need local educational agencies must submit an application containing specific information to the Director to be considered for a grant. The application for grants under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act must include a description of the partnership, the plan, and activities aligned with academic standards and research. The application for grants under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act must include a description of the partnership, plan, activities aligned with academic standards, research, and how success will be assessed. The application for grants under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act must include a description of the partnership, plan, activities aligned with academic standards, research, and how success will be assessed. The Director will evaluate applications based on the partnership's ability to effectively carry out programs, use relevant research to increase student achievement, align activities with state academic standards, and demonstrate widely implementable activities. The Director will evaluate the program established under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act based on the partnership's ability to demonstrate widely implementable activities that encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Act. The evaluation will use a common set of benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed by the partnerships. The Director will disseminate the results of the evaluation to the public and relevant committees, as well as make materials widely available. The Director will disseminate effective materials developed under the program to the public. Technical assistance will be provided to high-need local educational agencies for grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened for collaboration among grant recipients. The Director will provide an annual report on how the program is coordinated with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Definitions include high-need local educational agencies eligible for grants under the Rural and Low-Income School Program. The Income School Program, authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, defines the term 'National Laboratory' as per the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
