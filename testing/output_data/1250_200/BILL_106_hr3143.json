    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy environment, over half of schools are over 40 years old and need renovation, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect student performance, and inefficient water use is common in older schools. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation can lead to high performance buildings, improved student and teacher performance, lower life-cycle costs, and energy conservation. Utilizing renewable energy sources further enhances the sustainability of school buildings. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in producing high performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound elementary and secondary school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to help school districts with new school construction and renovations, as most districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for optimal efficiency. Using renewable energy sources like daylighting, passive solar heating, and photovoltaics can help meet energy needs without added emissions, while environmentally preferable products and adequate fresh air supply can improve indoor air quality in school buildings. SEC. 3. PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements and renovations. Grants aim to achieve a 30% increase in energy efficiency beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants are awarded based on demonstrated need for responding to school enrollments or facility renovations. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements and renovations. Grants are awarded based on demonstrated need for responding to school enrollments or facility renovations, and recipients must commit to developing high performance school buildings. Grants can also be used for evaluating compliance with program requirements and promoting the development of high performance school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements, renovations, and promoting high performance school buildings through various activities like organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants can also be used for promotional and marketing activities to encourage participation in energy efficiency initiatives. Grants are provided to school districts with developed plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education. The State agency, in consultation with State offices of energy and education, provides grants to school districts with feasible plans to achieve energy efficiency goals. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. Governors of the States will receive funds for implementing the Act, and they will allocate the funds as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. Authorization of appropriations is provided. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for subsequent years. SEC. 6. Definitions are provided. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" \"high performance school building,\" and \"renewable energy.\" High performance school buildings maximize renewable energy use, are cost-effective, use environmentally friendly materials, and optimize site potential. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
