FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition and lowering costs. APEC member economies aim for free and open trade by 2020. Economic growth and stability in the Pacific Rim are crucial for the US. The financial crisis in Asia is a concern. The United States' strategic and economic interests in the Pacific Rim region are impacted by trade barriers. The financial crisis in Asia has disrupted the rapid export growth pattern with the US. Free trade agreement negotiations are crucial in a time of increasing protectionist pressures. Countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore are allies in promoting economic growth through trade liberalization. Coordination with friendly countries is essential for the US. The United States must continue to promote its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through aggressive trade negotiations. Bilateral trade agreements can positively influence multilateral and regional trade talks, leading to more effective resolution of trade disputes with Pacific Rim countries. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries will enhance cooperation and market access, stabilizing the bilateral trade balance. The United States will implement trade policies with eligible Pacific Rim countries. The United States aims to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries. Nontariff barriers include regulatory obstacles, lack of intellectual property protection, and unfair trade practices. The President will identify eligible Pacific Rim countries for free trade consultations and ministerial meetings to discuss potential trade agreements. The International Trade Commission will provide advice on the economic effects of duty-free treatment for products from these countries on US industries and consumers. SEC. 4. MINISTERIAL MEETING RECOMMENDATIONS. The President recommends establishing a council of public and private sector officials to review trade practices, customs laws, economic data, and disputes for a potential free trade agreement. The council must issue a report on the bilateral relationship and prospects for a successful negotiation within 6 months of its establishment. The President suggests forming a council to review trade practices and disputes for a potential free trade agreement, with a focus on effective dispute settlement mechanisms. The President proposes a council to review trade practices and disputes for potential free trade agreements with eligible countries. The President, after receiving advice, shall determine the feasibility of negotiating a free trade agreement with a Pacific Rim country and submit a report to the Senate and House committees. Factors considered include WTO membership and interest in bilateral negotiations. The President will assess a country's eligibility for a free trade agreement based on factors like WTO membership, interest in bilateral negotiations, trade liberalization efforts, alignment with US trade policies, participation in WTO activities, and efforts to eliminate export requirements. The organization is working to eliminate export performance requirements, harmonize domestic and international standards, increase economic opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses, eliminate barriers to trade in services, provide national treatment for foreign direct investment, accommodate market access objectives of the United States, resolve trade disputes with the United States, improve dispute settlement mechanisms, and enhance the market for products and services of the United States. The organization aims to enhance the market for products and services of the United States by eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and structural impediments to trade in a specific country. The President must consult regularly with the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance regarding the implementation of the Act. The Act defines \"APEC\" as the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and \"eligible Pacific Rim country\" as a WTO member and a member economy of APEC."
