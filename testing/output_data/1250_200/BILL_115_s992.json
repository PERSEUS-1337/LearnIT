    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Overmedication Prevention Act of 2017\" mandates an independent review by the Department of Veterans Affairs of certain veteran suicides. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must arrange for a review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the deaths of covered veterans who died by suicide in the five-year period before the Act's enactment. The review will cover the total number of covered veterans who died by suicide, violent death, and accidental death during that period. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must arrange for a review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the deaths of covered veterans who died by suicide, violent death, and accidental death in the five-year period before the Act's enactment. The review includes a description of each covered veteran, a list of prescribed medications and substances, and a summary of medical diagnoses leading to medication prescriptions for conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. The curr_chunk discusses the use of medications for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, and other anxiety and depressive disorders. It also mentions the number of veterans on multiple prescribed medications and those not taking any medication. The curr_chunk focuses on the comparison between non-medication first-line treatments and medication for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, and other anxiety and depressive disorders. It also addresses the effectiveness of non-medication treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy before resorting to medication. The curr_chunk discusses the Department's clinical practice guidelines for prescribing medications, measuring pain scores, and maintaining staffing levels for mental health professionals. The curr_chunk focuses on maintaining appropriate staffing levels for mental health professionals, including counselors and therapists, by addressing impediments and strategies for increasing their representation in the Department's behavioral health workforce. The curr_chunk focuses on reviewing eligibility criteria for counselors and therapists, comparing them to other behavioral health professions, assessing their participation in training programs, evaluating hiring guidelines, and identifying gaps in the supply of mental health professionals. The curr_chunk discusses how the Department identifies gaps in mental health professional supply, determines staffing ratios, creates an occupational series for counselors and therapists, and ensures professional standards boards are representative. The curr_chunk discusses the composition of boards for mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists, the percentage of covered veterans with combat experience, identification of medical facilities with high prescription and suicide rates for veterans, and an analysis of Department programs collaborating with State Medicaid agencies and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The curr_chunk focuses on the Department's collaboration with State Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding prescription and behavioral health data sharing for veterans, checking with State prescription drug monitoring programs before prescribing medications, coordinating with external prescribers to prevent overprescribing, and actions taken when a veteran is overprescribed. It also includes an analysis of the collaboration between Department medical centers and medical examiners. The curr_chunk focuses on analyzing the collaboration of medical centers with medical examiners to determine veteran mortality and cause of death, identifying best practices for sharing veteran death certificate data, describing how data on veteran death certificates is collected by the Department of Veterans Affairs, assessing patterns in veteran mortality, and providing recommendations to improve veteran safety and well-being. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will compile data on covered veterans to inform clinical practice guidelines of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The agreement requires completion of the review and report by the National Academies. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will review and submit a report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days. The Secretary will then report the results to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs and make it publicly available. Definitions include \"black box warning\" and \"covered veteran.\" The term \"covered veteran\" refers to a veteran who received care from the Department of Veterans Affairs within five years of their death. \"First-line treatment\" is a highly rated intervention in clinical guidelines. \"State\" includes all states, territories, and possessions of the United States."
