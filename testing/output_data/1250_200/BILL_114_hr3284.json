The Secretary will develop a patient registry to collect data on mesothelioma in the US, including tracking epidemiology, treatment outcomes, and factors associated with the disease. The Secretary will establish a patient registry to gather data on mesothelioma in the US, including factors like environmental and occupational exposure, demographics (age, race, gender, family history), and making non-identifiable information accessible for research and prevention efforts. The patient registry for mesothelioma will collect data on risk factors, diagnosis markers, disease progression, epidemiology, natural history, prevention, detection, management, treatment approaches, and outcomes measures. The Secretary will consult with experts in epidemiology and disease surveillance. The patient registry for mesothelioma will include non-Federal experts such as epidemiologists, representatives of mesothelioma associations, health information technology experts, clinicians, and research scientists. The Secretary will coordinate with other Federal agencies and make registry information available to them. Public access to the registry will be subject to certain conditions. The Secretary will make information from the mesothelioma patient registry available to the public and researchers, ensuring privacy protections similar to HIPAA laws. A report outlining registry findings, future plans, and scope must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment.
