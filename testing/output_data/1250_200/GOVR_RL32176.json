    "content": "During hard market cycles in the insurance industry, supply decreases, prices rise, and underwriting standards tighten, making it challenging for consumers to find affordable insurance. Legislative focus on insurance matters during these times is often directed at state legislatures due to state regulation of the insurance market. Alternative market entities have been proposed as a solution to increase insurance availability for consumers. The creation of alternative market entities, such as risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups, was authorized by Congress in 1981 to expand insurance supply by simplifying state insurance regulation. Interest in these groups has increased as access to affordable insurance has become a challenge for some businesses, leading to suggestions for Congress to expand the narrow exception made in the 1980s to increase the supply of insurance in other areas. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to expand the federal preemption of state insurance laws to allow risk retention groups to cover commercial property risks and risk purchasing groups to purchase coverage for commercial property risks. The bill also includes additional federal corporate governance, disclosure, and fiduciary duty requirements for risk retention groups under the act. H.R. 2126 proposes a process for the Federal Insurance Office director to determine if state regulations on risk retention groups are preempted by the LRRA. It includes corporate governance standards like independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited service provider contracts. Amendments in H.R. 4802 expand consumer disclosure and impose a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. H.R. 4802, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, expands consumer disclosure and imposes a fiduciary duty on the board of directors of a risk retention group. It is similar to H.R. 2126 but includes changes such as replacing the \"Secretary of the Treasury\" with the \"Director of the Federal Insurance Office\" and removing a section calling for a study by the Comptroller General of the United States. The sponsors requested a study by the Government Accountability Office instead. H.R. 5792, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, aimed to expand LRRA exemptions for commercial property insurance and implement corporate governance standards for RRGs. The bill required independent directors on RRG boards, an audit committee, a written charter, and limited contracts with service providers. It also mandated that RRGs offering property coverage be U.S.-licensed insurance companies. The bill was discussed in a hearing but was not further acted upon in the 110th Congress. The bill aimed to expand LRRA exemptions for commercial property insurance and implement corporate governance standards for RRGs, requiring independent directors, an audit committee, a written charter, and limited contracts with service providers. It also mandated that RRGs offering property coverage be U.S.-licensed insurance companies. Risk retention groups are state-chartered insurance companies allowed to insure commercial liability risks, owned by group members, and must bear a federally mandated warning on policies. Group members are businesses or government entities facing similar risks. Corporate structure can vary, with some licensed as \"captive\" insurers. Risk retention groups are groups of entities facing similar risks that join together to purchase commercial insurance from established insurance companies. These groups operate outside of their domiciliary state to avoid the burden of complying with multiple state regulations. Insurers wishing to operate outside their domiciliary state must obtain licenses and adhere to regulations in each state where they do business, which can be particularly challenging in the insurance industry due to varying laws and regulations. The impact of multiple state regulations on insurance businesses is high due to price and policy content regulations. Some in the industry argue for a federal charter to replace or supplement the current state system. Risk retention groups are exempt from licensing requirements in all states but must file documentation with state regulators. They are subject to some state laws such as fraudulent trade practices and must pay state premium taxes. Risk retention groups must pay state premium taxes and are subject to some state laws. Non-domiciliary state regulators monitor their financial solvency, but oversight is less than for regular insurers, raising concerns about increased insolvency risk. In case of insolvency, policyholders have no recourse to state guaranty funds. Risk purchasing groups have a limited exemption from state law. State insurance regulators use fictitious grouping laws to protect consumers and ensure solvency. Risk purchasing groups are exempt from state insurance laws and countersignature laws. The insurance they purchase must comply with the laws of their domicile state. The \"Product Liability Risk Retention Act\" was introduced in 1979 to address difficulties in product liability insurance availability. The 1981 amended version limited risk retention and purchasing groups to product liability coverage for specific members. The 1981 Product Liability Risk Retention Act limited risk retention groups to product liability coverage for specific members, exempting them from most state regulations but not from laws unrelated to insurance. Despite market difficulties prompting the act, few groups were formed due to the availability of regular commercial insurance. In 1983, a Clarification of the Risk Retention Act (S. 1046, eventually P.L. 98-193) was passed to address issues with state tort laws conflicting with the federal definitions in the 1981 act. The insurance market began to harden in the mid-1980s, prompting Congress to reconsider the 1981 act and introduce bills to expand its provisions. In response to challenges faced by businesses and individuals in obtaining insurance, Congress passed P.L. 99-563, renaming the 1981 act the \"Liability Risk Retention Act.\" This expansion allowed for most types of commercial liability insurance and broadened the organizations eligible to form groups to include businesses, state or local governments, and similar entities. However, foreign-based risk retention groups were not retroactively included in this expansion, limiting their ability to offer various types of commercial liability insurance. The Liability Risk Retention Act (P.L. 99-563) allowed for most types of commercial liability insurance and expanded eligible organizations to form groups. Changes included increased oversight of risk retention and purchasing groups, with the intent to regulate by a single state regulator. Market reaction was swift, with 52 risk retention groups created by 1988, totaling $250 million in premiums. The number of groups plateaued at 79 in 1991, declining to 72 in 2001, while the number of insureds and total premiums continued to increase. The number of risk retention groups plateaued at 79 in 1991 and declined to 72 in 2001. Despite this, the number of insureds and total premium amount continued to increase, reaching over 172,000 insureds and $944 million in premiums in 2001. Significant churning was observed within the aggregate statistics, with 142 groups formed and 73 retired from 1987 to 2001. The insurance market experienced a hardening in 2001 due to various factors, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, leading to dramatic price increases. The insurance market saw significant price increases after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, following a soft market in the 1990s. Interest in risk retention groups grew, with the number of groups and premiums steadily increasing from 2001 to 2006. However, the number of insureds fluctuated, with a decline in 2002 before growing again by 2006. Growth in risk retention groups, particularly in the health care sector, was observed during the early 2000s. In the early 2000s, the liability insurance market saw growth in risk retention groups, particularly in the health care sector. The number of groups and premiums increased steadily from 2001 to 2006. By 2010, risk retention group premiums were estimated at $2.7 billion, with 262 groups in operation and over 272,000 insureds. However, there were some problems, such as a decline in the number of insureds from 2001 to 2004 due to the liquidation of three Tennessee-domiciled groups. The decline in the number of insured from 2001 to 2004 was due to the liquidation of three Tennessee-domiciled groups that insured professionals for liability. This was caused by the insolvency of a Virginia-based insurer who provided reinsurance for these groups. Policyholders of reinsured companies are considered creditors, not insureds, and have a lower priority claim on assets in case of insolvency. Lawsuits were filed seeking guaranty fund protection and damages for malfeasance. The insolvency of the National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group (National Warranty) in 2003, headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, attracted attention due to its unique regulatory status. It insured obligations for marketing companies and auto dealerships selling vehicle service contracts, with potential impacts on over 5,000 dealerships in 49 states. The LRRA requirement for insureds to be members and owners of a risk retention group was blurred in this case. The National Warranty case blurred the line between owners of a risk retention group and the insurer. Efforts have been made to expand the Risk Retention Act to include commercial property and casualty insurance. Interest groups and regulators support this expansion. Former officials like Lawrence Mirel and Leonard Crouse supported expanding the Risk Retention Act, but doubts were raised by Tim Wagner at NAIC meetings. A draft resolution opposing the expansion was discussed due to concerns about consumer protection and regulatory authority. A \"Risk Retention Working Group\" was formed to address issues, including proposing corporate governance standards for RRGs. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also highlighted problems in risk retention groups. The Risk Retention Act has proposed corporate governance standards for Risk Retention Groups (RRGs). The U.S. Government Accountability Office identified problems in RRGs in a 2005 report. The debate over expanding the LRRA revolves around availability vs. reliability of insurance. Supporters argue for expansion due to market failures, while opponents raise concerns about regulatory standards. Recent legislation in Congress has addressed concerns about the reliability of risk retention groups by implementing provisions for corporate governance structures and disclosure. The debate revolves around the assumption that a single state regulator may not adequately protect consumers in other states. Arguments are made that the insured, as owners of a risk retention group, can ensure the reliability of the insurance provided. Critics question the failure rates of regular insurers versus risk retention groups, citing the unique case of National Warranty as an offshore group unaccountable to state regulators. The debate over the reliability of risk retention groups centers on the unique case of National Warranty, an offshore group unaccountable to state regulators. Critics question the impact risk retention groups may have, citing their small market share compared to traditional insurers. The philosophical question of regulation in insurance markets is a challenge for Congress, with some advocating for heavy regulation to protect consumers while others prefer a market-driven approach. The insurance market regulation varies based on consumer sophistication, with commercial insurance being less regulated due to businesses' knowledge, while individual insurance like homeowners and auto is more regulated. Internationally, insurance markets are generally less regulated compared to the United States. State guaranty funds operate based on consumer sophistication levels. The regulatory approach in the insurance market varies based on consumer sophistication levels. State guaranty funds aim to pay claims from insolvent insurers but have a low cap on payouts, providing nearly full protection for individuals with low claims and only partial protection for larger businesses. This impacts risk retention groups, with businesses facing potentially large claims receiving less value from guaranty fund protection. Risk retention and purchasing groups make up a small part of the insurance market, with a total premium of $2.5 billion in risk retention groups compared to $422 billion in the property/casualty market in 2009. The $2.5 billion total premium written in the property/casualty market in 2009 was significantly lower than the $422 billion in the overall market. Despite this, competitors with smaller market shares can still impact prices and availability. The Risk Retention Act has been successful in expanding insurance availability, as seen in cases like the Pennsylvania nursing home risk retention group. Some advocate for increased federal regulation in the insurance industry, especially since the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The debate over the federal role in insurance regulation is ongoing, with some advocating for complete federalization while others suggest a lesser federal role to address specific issues. The Risk Retention Acts provide insight into how Congress has attempted to solve supply problems in the insurance regulatory system without broad federal regulation. The recent Dodd-Frank Act includes some insurance provisions, but the discussion on the federal role in insurance is expected to continue."
