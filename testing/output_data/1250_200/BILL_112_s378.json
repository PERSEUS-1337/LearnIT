    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children Act of 2011\" or the \"I Teach Act of 2011\". The \"Incentives to Educate American Children Act of 2011\" highlights the findings that classrooms are facing a shortage of experienced teachers, with the average years of teaching experience decreasing significantly. Research shows that more years of teaching experience positively impact student achievement. Additionally, rural school districts struggle with lower salaries for starting teachers due to increased transportation costs. Rural school districts have the lowest starting teacher salaries and face challenges with teacher certification and high first-year teacher rates. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 to set high standards for accomplished teachers. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards sets high standards for accomplished teachers, with nearly 91,000 teachers certified. Studies show that students taught by certified teachers perform better on tests. A recent study found that public school teachers earn less than other college graduates. This Act aims to encourage teachers to work in public schools through a refundable tax credit. To incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools, a refundable tax credit is proposed. Additionally, a tax credit is suggested for teachers who achieve certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to attract and retain highly qualified educators in public schools. A new tax credit proposal, section 36D, aims to incentivize individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. A new tax credit proposal, section 36D, offers a credit to eligible teachers working in high poverty or rural schools. The credit amount is $1,000 for teachers in schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. The tax credit proposal, section 36D, provides a credit of $1,000 for certified teachers in schools with high poverty or rural areas. For teachers in schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches, the credit amount is $2,000. Eligible teachers are defined as full-time kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teachers in public schools.
