    "content": "Prior to 1988, Medicaid did not cover services listed in a child's IEP/IFSP as special education funds were used. Congress changed the financing relationship between IDEA and Medicaid in 1988. IDEA requires interagency agreements to ensure services for eligible students, with Medicaid considered the first payer. The 1988 law allows but does not require this according to CMS officials. The 1988 law allows state Medicaid agencies to pay for services in an IEP/IFSP, but it is not required. Most states do pay for these services, but concerns have been raised about improper Medicaid payments for school-based services. The Senate Finance Committee asked the GAO to examine billing practices for school-based administrative services. The GAO identified concerns with Medicaid school-based services, including improper payments in 2 states due to billing practices and lack of oversight. Some states used \"bundled\" billing methods that did not account for variations in service needs. School districts in some states received little reimbursement due to state agencies and private contractors retaining significant portions of federal payments. Some states retained 50% to 85% of federal reimbursements for health services and administrative activities, with school districts paying high contingency fees to private contractors. Schools received as little as $7.50 for every $100 claimed for services for Medicaid-eligible children. LEAs must meet four conditions to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement for IDEA-related services. HCFA and later CMS issued manuals to help schools obtain Medicaid reimbursement. The 2003 guide consolidated requirements for Medicaid school-based administrative claiming, drawing on input from the education community. Nationwide, Medicaid expenditures for school-based services were $2.7 billion in FY2006, with $1.9 billion for benefits and $849 million for administration/training. Spending patterns varied widely across states, with some focusing solely on benefits and others on administration/training. In FY2006, nationwide Medicaid expenditures for school-based services totaled $2.7 billion, with $1.9 billion allocated for benefits and $849 million for administration/training. The Bush Administration highlighted concerns about abuse and overpayments in Medicaid claims for school services, particularly in transportation and administrative activities. Improper billing practices include lack of verification for provided transportation, billing for services not rendered, and absence of recommendations for transportation services in child/family plans. School districts may handle administrative tasks for Medicaid, such as outreach, eligibility intake, and interagency coordination. The Bush Administration published a final rule in 2007 regarding inappropriate Medicaid billing for school-based administration and transportation services. The rule aimed to restrict federal payments for certain administrative activities and transportation services provided to children eligible for both Medicaid and IDEA. Examples of inappropriate billing practices included inaccurate time studies, expenditures for non-administrative costs, and payments for personnel not performing Medicaid administrative activities. The final rule published by the Bush Administration in 2007 aimed to restrict federal payments for certain transportation services provided to children eligible for both Medicaid and IDEA. The rule was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid outlays by billions of dollars over several years. CMS indicated that school budgets for the 2007-2008 school year would not be affected by the rule. The final rule published by the Bush Administration in 2007 aimed to restrict federal payments for certain transportation services provided to children eligible for both Medicaid and IDEA. This rule has faced opposition from the education and state Medicaid communities, who argue that it will reduce access to needed healthcare for children and is inconsistent with approved state plan amendments. Additional federal funding to offset these Medicaid cuts is unlikely. The final rule eliminates federal matching funds for certain school-based Medicaid spending, but other school-based expenditures are still reimbursable. States can claim federal matching dollars for administrative activities conducted by state or local Medicaid employees. Federal funding remains available for administrative overhead costs related to direct medical services. Medicaid outreach and eligibility intake by Medicaid employees are also reimbursable. CMS will continue to reimburse states for school-based direct medical services under IDEA covered in approved state Medicaid plans, as well as transportation of school-age children to non-school-based medical service providers participating in Medicaid. P.L. 110-173 prohibited the Secretary of HHS from restricting coverage or payments for school-based administration and transportation under Medicaid until June 30, 2008, with an extension to April 1, 2009 under P.L. 110-252. The moratorium on restricting coverage or payments for school-based administration and transportation under Medicaid was extended to April 1, 2009, through P.L. 110-252 and further extended to July 1, 2009, via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). The estimated cost of the moratorium on certain final rules is $105 million in FY2009."
