    "content": "The Act titled \"Indian and Alaska Native Foster Care and Adoption Services Amendments of 2001\" allows Indian tribes to receive federal funds for foster care and adoption assistance. SEC. 2. Indian tribes can receive federal funds for foster care and adoption assistance, including children in tribal custody. \"Programs operated by Indian tribal organizations under SEC. 479B.\" This part applies to Indian tribes operating programs under the same conditions as states. Indian tribes submitting plans must identify service areas and approve foster homes based on tribal standards for child safety. Federal share determination is based on per capita income. When determining the Federal medical assistance percentage for an Indian tribe, the per capita income calculation is based on the tribe's service population as defined in its plan. Tribes can submit relevant information for consideration in the calculation. The Secretary will determine the proportions to be paid to tribes, ensuring they do not receive more than allowed under section 474(a)(3). An Indian tribe may receive payments under section 474(a)(3) with a proportion not less than that specified for a State. The tribe can use Federal or State funds to match payments. The Secretary can modify requirements if it benefits the safety of children. Participating Indian tribes in a consortium can submit a single plan. Indian tribes can enter into cooperative agreements. An Indian tribe or intertribal consortium and a State can enter into a cooperative agreement for fund administration. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within a year of enactment. Definitions of 'Indian tribe' and 'tribal organization' are provided in this section. The terms 'Indian tribe' and 'tribal organization' are defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon enactment of the Act, regardless of regulations being in place."
