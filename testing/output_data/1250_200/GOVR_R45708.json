The bill also includes a 12% increase for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes a budget of $44.66 billion, 3% higher than FY2018 and 23% above the FY2019 request. The bill was signed into law on September 21, 2018. The FY2020 budget proposes significant reductions in DOE energy research and development programs, including cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. Programs targeted for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs. The FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill targets programs for elimination or phaseout, including energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs. Funding reductions are proposed for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP. Congressional consideration is influenced by budget enforcement measures from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 enforces spending limits through sequestration. The discretionary spending limits for FY2020 are lower than FY2019, with defense and nondefense limits decreasing by 11% and 9% respectively. A bill to raise these limits for FY2020 and FY2021 has been reported by the House Budget Committee. Issues raised by the Administration's budget request may generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The Administration's budget request for Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020 could spark controversy in Congress. The request includes significant funding cuts for USACE and Reclamation, with reductions of 31% and 29% respectively. USACE's funding would be limited to projects with benefits at least 2.5 times their costs, and the Administration proposes transferring a program from USACE to DOE. The FY2020 budget proposal includes transferring the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program from USACE to DOE. Reclamation's funding would be reduced by $461.6 million (29%) to $1.11 billion. The budget request also includes mandatory proposals related to the Power Marketing Administrations, with a proposal to divest assets of three PMAs that own transmission infrastructure. The FY2020 budget request proposes selling assets of Power Marketing Administrations, including transmission lines and substations, to yield savings of $5.8 billion over 10 years. It also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program and transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate setting approach, estimated to generate $1.9 billion in new revenues. Additionally, the budget calls for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for transmission projects, saving $640 million over 10 years. These proposals require congressional authorization. The FY2020 budget proposes terminating the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program to save money. These programs provide grants for energy efficiency improvements and planning assistance to states. Congressional action has not been taken on these proposals yet. The DOE's FY2020 budget proposes eliminating the Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program to save money. These programs offer grants for energy efficiency improvements and planning assistance to states. The proposed budget also includes significant reductions in funding for various energy research areas, with a focus on early-stage R&D rather than deployment activities. The DOE's FY2020 budget proposes significant reductions in funding for nuclear fuel cycle R&D, focusing on early-stage R&D. The budget includes new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, with $116 million allocated for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity. The DOE's FY2020 budget proposes significant reductions in funding for nuclear fuel cycle R&D, focusing on early-stage R&D. $116 million in nuclear waste funding would come from two appropriations accounts: $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $26 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal for Yucca Mountain. The Yucca Mountain repository license application was submitted in 2008 but suspended in 2011 due to lack of funding. The Obama Administration deemed the site \"unworkable\" due to Nevada's opposition. The House approved funding for Yucca Mountain for FY2018 and a $100 million increase for FY2019, but the Senate did not include it. The FY2019 Senate bill included a pilot program for interim nuclear waste storage, but it was not enacted. The FY2020 budget request includes provisions to halt further loans and loan guarantees for various DOE programs, including the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. Additionally, the budget proposal would rescind unused prior-year authority for loan guarantee commitments and unspent appropriations for loan guarantee \"subsidy costs.\" Despite this, DOE provided $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees for two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia after the budget request was submitted. The FY2020 DOE budget request includes funding for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, with the U.S. contributing $107 million. The project aims to advance fusion technology for electricity production. The U.S. is responsible for 9% of the project's construction costs, estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. Other collaborators include the European Union, Russia, Japan, India, South Korea, and China. The U.S. contributes to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France, with funding estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The DOE budget for FY2020 includes $107 million for ITER. The Trump Administration's budget proposes eliminating ARPA-E and rescinding $287 million in unobligated balances. Congress has increased ARPA-E funding in previous years despite Administration proposals to terminate it. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level. Funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs would increase by 10%, with notable increases for the W80-4 LEP and the initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The increase in the request for the W80-4 warhead is due to a new budget estimate, not the acceleration of missile development. The FY2020 request seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead. The FY2020 budget request seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead, to be carried by the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent missile entering service in the 2030s. The budget also includes $10 million for the W76-2 warhead and $51.5 million for surveillance of the B83 gravity bomb, a controversial decision reversed by the Trump Administration. The FY2020 budget request includes a significant increase in funding for Plutonium Sustainment within the NNSA budget to support the production of plutonium pits for nuclear warheads at two facilities. The DOE's Office of Environmental Management would see a decrease in funding for environmental cleanup and waste management activities in FY2020. The FY2020 budget request includes a decrease in funding for the DOE's Office of Environmental Management, with proposed transfers and reductions in various cleanup programs. Table 2 shows budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2011 to FY2019, along with the FY2020 request.
