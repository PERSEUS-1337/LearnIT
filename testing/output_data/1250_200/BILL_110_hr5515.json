    "content": "Section 233(e) of the Act is amended to allow agreements to enter into force after 60 days of transmittal to Congress. Documents must be delivered to both Houses of Congress on the same day. The document setting forth an agreement under this section must include a determination by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration on the impact of the agreement on the actuarial balance of the social security system over a 75-year period. The agreement must result in a net reduction in the actuarial balance by at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll for the period. The terms defined in the agreement include 'taxable payroll' as total wages and self-employment income, 'adjusted summarized income rate' as the ratio of trust fund balance and total income from taxes, 'adjusted summarized cost rate' as the ratio of cost and targeted trust fund balance, and 'trust fund balance' as the combined balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The term 'trust fund balance' refers to the combined balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. 'Income from taxes' is the amounts deposited in the Trust Funds based on taxes under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. 'Cost' includes disbursements from the Trust Funds, such as benefit payments, administrative expenses, and payments for vocational rehabilitation services. The term 'target trust fund balance' refers to the balance needed to support a 100 percent OASDI trust fund ratio after a 75-year period. The Chief Actuary uses the intermediate assumptions of the Board of Trustees for making determinations. Agreements under this section will not take effect if a disapproving bill is enacted within 60 days. The Chief Actuary's determination on an agreement's impact on the social security system must show a net reduction of at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll for the agreement to take effect. If not, a bill approving the agreement must be enacted within 60 days for it to enter into force. During a 60-day period, Congress has the privilege to consider a bill for the disapproval or approval of an agreement. This process is deemed part of the rules of each House and allows for changes to be made to the rules relating to the procedure of that House.
