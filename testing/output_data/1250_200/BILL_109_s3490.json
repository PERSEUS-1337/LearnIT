    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge Study Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the scenic Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, and bald eagle. Additionally, Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern. Cherry Valley is home to special-concern species like neotropical migratory birds, waterfowl, rare plants, and anadromous fish. The Kittatinny Ridge serves as an important migration route for birds of prey, including bald eagles and golden eagles. The ridge also includes a segment of the Appalachian Trail. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley includes the Appalachian Trail and rare wildlife habitats like calcareous wetlands. Ongoing studies show high water quality in Cherry Creek. There is local support for a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with federal parcels like the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a segment of the Appalachian Trail owned by the National Park Service. Local communities, conservation entities, and landowners support the establishment of Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, viewing it as a complement to existing conservation efforts. Some landowners have already placed their land into conservation easements. Several local landowners have placed their land into conservation easements or other arrangements, supported by voter-approved open space and municipal land conservation funds in Monroe County, Pennsylvania.
