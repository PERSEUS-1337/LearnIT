    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, national security, and the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies for engineering biology, as other countries are also investing in this field. The United States is at risk of losing its competitive lead in engineering biology without necessary investment and a national strategy. A National Engineering Biology Initiative can establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and ensure optimal returns on Federal investment. The Act defines key terms such as Advisory Committee, biomanufacturing, engineering biology, Interagency Committee, and Program. The Act also establishes the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity. This includes advancing research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, supporting social science research, expanding the number of researchers with engineering biology training, accelerating commercialization of research, and improving interagency coordination. Program activities involve sustained support for research through grants to individual investigators. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to support research through grants to investigators, educate students in interdisciplinary sciences, track economic benefits, and accelerate commercialization of new technologies. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to support research, facilitate public-private partnerships, connect researchers with entrepreneurship education, support proof of concept activities, and encourage the formation of startup companies. It also focuses on expanding participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions and addressing ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program focuses on supporting research, facilitating partnerships, connecting researchers with entrepreneurship education, and encouraging startup formation. It also addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues by integrating research on these topics and ensuring public input through regular discussions. The President will designate an interagency committee on engineering biology to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. The committee will coordinate federal research, establish goals, and update priorities for the Program. The interagency committee on engineering biology will oversee the Program, establish goals, update priorities, and develop a strategic plan every 5 years. The plan will guide activities, support research, education, ethical issues, and move results into application for societal benefit and competitiveness. An annually coordinated interagency budget will be proposed. The Interagency Committee on engineering biology will propose an annually coordinated interagency budget for the Program to ensure robust research and development. They will also develop a plan to utilize Federal programs in support of their goals and consider recommendations from various groups. An annual report will be submitted to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. The Interagency Committee will prepare an annual report for Congress, detailing the Program budget, agency spending, research facilities, and Small Business Innovation Research awards. The Interagency Committee will prepare an annual report for Congress, detailing the Program budget, agency spending, research facilities, and Small Business Innovation Research awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors. The committee will assess progress, revise the Program as needed, evaluate funding balance, and address ethical and societal issues. Reports are to be submitted every 3 years after enactment and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The advisory committee on engineering biology research and development will report findings and recommendations every 5 years to key committees, exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. EXTERNAL REVIEW OF ETHICAL, LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIETAL ISSUES: The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations for addressing research needs. A summary report will be transmitted to key congressional committees within 2 years.\n\nSEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. The National Science Foundation will support basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provide research instrumentation support, and award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology and biomanufacturing. The Department of Energy will conduct research in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology and biofuel development. They will also provide access to advanced facilities for industry and higher education institutions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct research in engineering biology fields and award grants for research in industry settings. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on the environmental impact of engineering biology products and systems."
