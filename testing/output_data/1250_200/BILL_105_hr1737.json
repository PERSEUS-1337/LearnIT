The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" emphasizes the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care for women throughout their lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a crucial role in managing women's health beyond just reproductive care, reducing the need for costly referrals to other physicians. The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" highlights the role of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing comprehensive health care for women. More than 20 states have taken steps to improve access to these specialists, but patients in certain areas still face restrictions. SEC. 2706 of the Public Health Service Act ensures access to obstetrical and gynecological services under group health plans and insurance coverage. SEC. 2706 of the Public Health Service Act guarantees access to obstetrical and gynecological services in group health plans and insurance coverage. Female enrollees can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care. In accordance with State law, gynecologic care ordered by a participating physician is considered authorized by the primary care provider. This does not waive coverage requirements for medical necessity or appropriateness. Group health plans and insurers cannot deny or penalize women for enrolling or renewing coverage to avoid these requirements. Monetary incentives to accept less coverage are also prohibited. The section prohibits penalizing providers for offering care in accordance with the requirements, mandates compliance with notice requirements, allows negotiation of reimbursement levels, and does not override more protective state laws for health insurance issuers. The section prohibits penalizing providers for offering care in accordance with requirements, mandates compliance with notice requirements, allows negotiation of reimbursement levels, and does not override more protective state laws for health insurance issuers. Amendments are made to section 2723 of the Act and ERISA to include new provisions related to group health insurance coverage. Standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services are outlined in Section 713. In the provision of health insurance coverage, a group health plan must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider. If not designated, the plan cannot require prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care provided by a participating obstetrician-gynecologist. In accordance with State law, gynecologic care ordered by a participating physician is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. This does not waive coverage requirements for medical necessity. Group health plans cannot deny or penalize women to avoid complying with these regulations. The section prohibits actions that discourage women from receiving minimum protections or penalize providers for offering care under the regulations. It also requires notice of any plan modifications and allows negotiation of reimbursement levels. State laws providing more protection are not preempted. The section prohibits actions that discourage women from receiving minimum protections or penalize providers for offering care under the regulations. It also allows negotiation of reimbursement levels with providers for care provided. State laws providing more protection are not preempted. Amendments are made to various sections of the Act to include section 713(f) and expand coverage. The Public Law 104-204 is amended by adding section 713 to section 711. The table of contents in the Act is updated to include the new item related to section 713. The Public Law 104-204 is amended to include a new section 713 regarding standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws can provide greater protections for enrollees than federal law. The amendments to the Affordable Care Act provide greater protections for enrollees in group health insurance coverage. The effective dates for these changes vary depending on the type of health plan or insurance coverage. The amendments made by the Affordable Care Act do not apply to plan years beginning before the later of the date the last collective bargaining agreements relating to the plan terminate or January 1, 1998. Plan amendments made to conform to new requirements added by the Act do not count as termination of collective bargaining agreements."
