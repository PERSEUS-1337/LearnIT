The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the 1918 influenza outbreak. Disparities in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries are increasing, potentially reversing progress in child survival. The National Intelligence Council estimates a significant rise in AIDS orphans globally in the next decade. The global increase in AIDS orphans is projected to triple in the next 10 years, leading to economic decline, social unrest, and political instability in vulnerable societies. Some developing nations have successfully implemented HIV prevention programs, but the spread of infectious diseases poses a significant threat to global health and economy. United States financial support for medical research and disease containment is crucial in addressing this issue. United States financial support for global medical research and disease containment is crucial. A proposed Fourth Amendment to the International Monetary Fund aims to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases worldwide, but it has not been implemented due to lack of Congressional authorization. The amendment has been accepted by the majority of IMF members. The International Monetary Fund has 110 members representing 72.18% of total voting power. Approval of the Fourth Amendment by the United States, with 17.16% voting power, would allow for Special Drawing Rights allocation. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria leverages resources from donor nations to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to accept the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, allowing for the contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The United States Governor of the Fund accepts the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement, allowing for the contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide for contributions in fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The Secretary of the Treasury will negotiate with other Fund members to contribute Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in fiscal years 2004 through 2006."
