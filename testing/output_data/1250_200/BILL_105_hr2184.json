    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\". Congress acknowledges the rapid growth of private security officers in the United States, who work alongside public law enforcement to prevent and reduce crime. The private security industry offers entry-level opportunities for job seekers, including those affected by economic challenges. These officers protect individuals and various properties such as banks, hospitals, airports, and schools, complementing the services provided by sworn law enforcement officers. The growth of private security officers in the United States has accelerated rapidly, with the public having more contact with them than with sworn law enforcement officers. This trend has increased as the number of public sector law enforcement officers has decreased, leading to challenges in discerning between the two. The demand for more public sector law enforcement officers to combat serious crimes is also highlighted. The American public demands well-trained private security personnel as an adjunct, not a replacement for sworn law enforcement officers. Private security officers should be thoroughly screened, especially since many carry weapons. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS. Employers of private security officers can request an association designated by the Attorney General to submit fingerprints for background checks. The Attorney General will search criminal records and provide results within 30 days. The use of advanced technology is encouraged for compiling criminal history information. An association designated by the Attorney General must promptly submit employee fingerprints for identification and processing. They are also required to transfer identification and criminal history records to employers and relevant licensing authorities within one business day. The Attorney General has the authority to establish regulations for the security, accuracy, and dissemination of information, as well as impose necessary fees for cost recovery. The Attorney General requires an association to submit employee fingerprints promptly for identification and processing, transfer records to employers and licensing authorities within one business day, and establish regulations for information security.
