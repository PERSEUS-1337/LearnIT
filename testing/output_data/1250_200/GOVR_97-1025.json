    "content": "The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, protects federal interest computers from trespassing, threats, damage, espionage, and fraud. It complements other state and federal criminal laws and has been amended over the last three decades. CFAA focuses on computers as victims, while other laws address computers in different contexts such as crime arenas or evidence repositories. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, outlines various offenses related to computer trespassing, fraud, threats, and espionage. It prohibits actions such as damaging government or bank computers, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and trafficking in passwords. Attempting or conspiring to commit these offenses is also considered a crime under the Act. Penalties for these offenses are detailed in subsection 1030(c). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, outlines various offenses related to computer trespassing, fraud, threats, and espionage. It prohibits actions such as damaging government or bank computers, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and trafficking in passwords. Penalties for these offenses are detailed in subsection 1030(c). Subsection 1030(b) makes it a crime to attempt or conspire to commit any of these offenses, with penalties ranging from imprisonment for not more than a year to life imprisonment for death-result offenses. Subsection 1030 fraudulently preserves the investigative authority of the Secret Service, while subsection 1030(e) provides common definitions. Subsection 1030(f) disclaims any application to otherwise permissible law enforcement activities. Subsection 1030(g) creates a cause of action for victims of these crimes. Subsection 1030(h) called for annual reports through 1999 from the Attorney General and Secretary of the Treasury on investigations under the damage paragraph (18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5)). Subsections 1030(i) and (j) authorize the confiscation of property generated by, or used to facilitate the commission of, one of the offenses under subsection 1030(a) or (b). (a) Whoever ... (3) intentionally, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer of a department or agency of the. Paragraph 1030(a)(3) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers, whether exclusively used by the government or shared with others. Attempted intrusions and conspiracies to intrude are also outlawed under subsection 1030(b). Unauthorized access to shared computers is only considered a crime if it affects the government's use or would have affected it if the attempt had been successful. Unauthorized access to government computers is prohibited under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, whether the computer is exclusively used by the government or shared with others. Intrusions, attempted intrusions, and conspiracies to intrude are all outlawed. Unauthorized access to shared computers is only considered a crime if it affects the government's use. The Committee clarifies that the new subsection will only ban intentional trespassing on Federal computers, without the need to show further actions on the accessed information. It aims to cover individuals without authorized access, including those who maintain access after an inadvertent initial entry. Congress allows for a certain level of trespassing by government employees to protect whistleblowers, and the Committee is specific about who can be prosecuted under the new subsection. The Committee aims to balance the protection of Government computers against abuse by \"outsiders\" while allowing a certain degree of trespassing by government employees to protect whistleblowers. They clarify who may be prosecuted under the new subsection and do not criminalize acts where an employee exceeds authorized access in their own department. The Committee believes that administrative sanctions are more appropriate than criminal punishment for unauthorized access within a department. They distinguish between unauthorized access within a department and trespasses into computers of another department to prevent prosecution for minor infractions. The Committee has limited 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3) to cases where the offender is completely outside the Government or where the offender's act of trespass is interdepartmental in nature, to prevent prosecution for minor infractions within a department. The Committee limits 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3) to cases of trespass involving interdepartmental acts to prevent prosecution for minor infractions within a department. Trespassing on governmental computer space is prohibited only when it affects government use or use for governmental purposes. Serious intradepartmental trespass cases may be subject to other criminal penalties under proposed legislation. The trespassing ban on computer space not exclusively for governmental use is prohibited only when it affects government use or use for governmental purposes. The Department of Justice has concerns about the language of the subsection and clarifications have been made to specify that the offender's conduct only needs to affect the use of the government's operation of the computer in question. The reports do not provide much insight into which computers are protected from trespassing. The statute 1030(a)(3) protects government computers from trespassing, with specific language indicating that it applies to computers owned or leased by the federal government. It also covers government computers available for non-governmental use. The statute 1030(a)(3) protects government computers from trespassing, including those owned or leased by the federal government and available for non-governmental use. The term \"nonpublic\" clarifies that shared access does not extend to the general public. Definitions for \"department of the United States\" and \"agency of the United States\" are provided in the section. The jurisdictional aspect of paragraph 1030(a)(3) remains unclear. The jurisdictional aspect of paragraph 1030(a)(3) is unclear, particularly regarding hacking initiated or occurring overseas. Federal laws generally apply within the United States, but exceptions exist when Congress explicitly negates the presumption or when the nature of the offense suggests overseas application. In the cybercrime context, courts have ruled on the extraterritorial reach of certain federal statutes. The federal statute outlawing conspiracy to violate federal law applies to overseas smuggling conspiracies. In cybercrime, courts have ruled that unauthorized computer access to defraud applies to hackers overseas. Congress amended the definition of \"protected computers\" to include those used in foreign commerce. Extraterritorial jurisdiction was explicitly provided for computer-related offenses, but not for simple trafficking offenses. The amendment to the federal statute includes provisions for computer-related offenses such as fraud, damage, and extortion, with penalties for violations including imprisonment and fines. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is granted for certain offenses under specific paragraphs, while simple trafficking offenses may not fall under this jurisdiction. Other consequences for offenses include forfeiture, restitution, racketeering, and civil liability provisions. The forfeiture provisions of subsections 1030(i) and (j) authorize the confiscation of a cyber trespasser's computer and property. Federal authorities historically did not prosecute juvenile offenders, but most federal crimes, including computer hacking, are crimes under state laws. Juveniles violating federal law may be turned over to state authorities unless certain conditions are met. Paragraph 1030(a)(3) has seen few prosecutions since 1986, possibly due to its similarity to paragraph 1030(a)(2). The explanation for the limited prosecutions under paragraph 1030(a)(3) since 1986 may be due to its similarity to paragraph 1030(a)(2), which is reserved for more serious cases. Attempting to hack into a federal computer under paragraph 1030(a)(3) is also punishable as a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. 1030(b). Subsection 1030(b) punishes attempts to violate any paragraphs of subsection 1030(a), with no general federal attempt statute existing. The law surrounding attempts to violate federal computer laws requires proof of intent and a substantial step towards the offense. Conspiracy to access a government computer without authorization is a separate federal crime, with all involved parties being guilty regardless of success. If a conspirator successfully hacks into a government computer, all involved can be prosecuted under paragraph 1030(a)(3). Conspiracy to access a government computer without authorization is a federal crime, punishable under subsection 1030(b) with specific penalties outlined in subsection (c). Unlike general conspiracy statutes, subsection 1030(b) does not require proof of an overt act and can result in imprisonment for up to 5 years for federal felonies. Conspiracy to commit federal misdemeanors under subsection 1030(b) may result in penalties equal to the underlying misdemeanor. Those who aid or abet federal crimes are liable as principals for the offense. Subsection 1030(b) also addresses attempts to violate subsection 1030(a), raising questions about accessories in criminal liability. The liability of accessories in criminal offenses under subsection 1030(a) raises questions, particularly in cases of aiding or abetting a crime that never goes beyond the attempt phase. Computer trespassing, such as hacking into government computers without causing damage, is a unique offense with limited overlap with other laws. Hacking into government computers may violate federal statutes such as 18 U.S.C. 1030 and 2701. Misidentifying oneself to access a federal computer could lead to violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 912. However, proving adverse impact on a governmental agency is necessary for conviction under these statutes. Unauthorized access to a computer, including obtaining financial information or data from a government agency, is punishable under federal anti-hacking laws. Attempting to commit such offenses also carries penalties. Unauthorized access to a computer, including obtaining financial information or data from a government agency, is punishable under federal anti-hacking laws. Attempting to commit such offenses also carries penalties. One step beyond simple hacking is the prohibition against acquiring certain protected information by intentional unauthorized computer access. It may be difficult to distinguish between violations of simple trespass proscriptions and trespassing-with-information-acquisition prohibitions. The history of trespass provisions aims to exclude whistleblowers and federal employees for simple trespassing within their agency. The courts will determine if paragraph 1030(a)(2) effectively amends the simple trespassing provisions. The courts will determine if paragraph 1030(a)(2) effectively amends the simple trespassing provisions by requiring intentional unauthorized computer access to a protected computer. The government must prove intentional access without authorization to sustain a conviction, with the intent element being the same as that required for simple trespassing. The terms \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" have posed challenges in court interpretations. The courts have faced challenges in interpreting the terms \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in paragraph 1030(a)(2) of 18 U.S.C. 1030. Some courts have applied these terms to unauthorized use by authorized employees or outsiders with access subject to restrictions. Others have distinguished between accessing a computer without any permission and accessing information not entitled to. One court found breaching MySpace's terms of service could potentially constitute unauthorized access. The court found that breaching MySpace's terms of service could potentially constitute unauthorized access to a computer/server. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) covers a wider range of computers and information, including federal government, financial, and protected computer information. The protection for financial information under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2) aims to safeguard computerized credit records and information related to customers' relationships with financial institutions. The legislation intends to extend privacy protections to all customers of financial institutions, not just individuals or partnerships with five or fewer partners. The Department of Justice has raised concerns about the broad scope of the term \"obtains information\" in this subsection. The Department of Justice has concerns about the term 'obtains information' in 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2) potentially requiring proof of data asportation. The committee clarified that 'obtaining information' includes mere observation and does not necessitate physical removal or copying of data. This interpretation extends to information obtained from federal computers and through cyberspace trespassing. The term 'obtaining information' in the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute includes merely reading it, without the need for copying or transporting it. This interpretation aims to prevent the theft of intangible information stored electronically, ensuring that unauthorized use of a computer to steal such information is prohibited. This subsection also addresses the theft of copyrighted information, potentially implicating rights under copyright laws. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 expanded the reach of computer theft laws by eliminating the requirement for interstate communication and broadening the definition of a \"protected computer\" to include those affecting interstate commerce. This allows authorities to address hacking crimes within the same state and extends coverage to any computer with even a minimal impact on commerce. The amendment also considers computers accessing the Internet as being used in interstate commerce. The USA PATRIOT Act amendment expanded the definition of \"protected computer\" to include those used in interstate or foreign commerce. It raises questions about extraterritorial application in unauthorized access cases. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses carry criminal penalties and have a three-tier sentencing structure. Simple violations are punished as misdemeanors, while more serious offenses can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines up to $250,000. The USA PATRIOT Act amendment expanded the definition of \"protected computer\" to include those used in interstate or foreign commerce. It raises questions about extraterritorial application in unauthorized access cases. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses carry criminal penalties with a three-tier sentencing structure. The second tier involves imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations) for offenses committed for commercial advantage, private financial gain, or exceeding $5,000 in value. The phrases in question in the current text chunk suggest criminal, tortious, or financially advantageous purposes beyond computer trespassing. The value of information acquired by hackers may be difficult to determine, with different courts using various methods to assess it. Repeat offenders face increased punishment of up to 10 years in prison and/or fines up to $250,000. Federal law is strict on prosecuting juveniles for intrusion and information acquisition offenses. Federal law imposes penalties for repeat offenders of computer intrusion and information acquisition offenses, with fines of up to $500,000 for organizations. Federal proceedings are only possible if the state is unable or unwilling to prosecute. The Sentencing Guidelines ensure consistent sentencing for federal crimes based on the seriousness of the offense. Violations of paragraph 1030(a)(2) are governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1. The final total determines the sentencing range in months of imprisonment and fines. The Tenth Circuit's opinion in Willis illustrates the sentencing process, where enhancements were applied based on the offense details, resulting in a 41-month imprisonment for Mr. Willis. The Guidelines now include additional offense levels for specific circumstances like critical infrastructure involvement and personal information acquisition. The Guidelines now add offense levels for critical infrastructure involvement and personal information acquisition. Section 1030 allows confiscation of property derived from violations, with restitution ordered for certain federal crimes. The court has discretion to order restitution for federal crimes, except for acquisition offenses under Paragraph 1030(a)(2). Restitution may be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release, especially in cases involving computer security breaches causing pecuniary loss to the victim. Subsection 1030(g) allows for compensatory damages and injunctive relief for victims of \u00a71030 violations resulting in specific types of loss or damage. The court has discretion to order restitution for federal crimes, except for acquisition offenses under Paragraph 1030(a)(2). Restitution may be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release, especially in cases involving computer security breaches causing pecuniary loss to the victim. Subsection 1030(g) allows for compensatory damages and injunctive relief for victims of \u00a71030 violations resulting in specific types of loss or damage, such as loss or damage described in clauses 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I) through (V) aggregating at least $5,000 in value, modification or impairment of medical care, physical injury, threat to public health or safety, damage affecting government computer systems, or damage affecting 10 or more protected computers during any 1-year period. No need to prove violation of paragraph 1030(a)(5) as long as this type of loss or damage has been suffered. Some courts allow victims to combine losses to meet the $5,000 threshold under subsection 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I) if caused by the same defendant in the same manner. The term \"person\" in relation to victims entitled to relief was previously undefined, but now it is clarified to include individuals and legal entities, excluding governmental entities. Congress's use of \"person\" in paragraph 1030(a)(7) suggests it refers only to individuals. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"person\" to include individuals, firms, corporations, educational institutions, governmental entities, or other entities. It also defined \"loss\" broadly to cover various costs incurred by victims. Victims of cyber offenses have two years to file suits under subsection 1030(g), with compensatory damages limited to economic damages. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the USA PATRIOT Act imposes penalties for attempting, conspiring, or aiding and abetting cyber offenses. Those involved in such activities are subject to the same penalties as those who commit the substantive offense, including liability for any foreseeable crimes committed in furtherance of the scheme. This provision is unique compared to other federal conversion statutes. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the USA PATRIOT Act imposes penalties for cyber offenses without requiring larcenous intent, providing prosecutors with a more serious charge against hackers. It allows for an alternative or additional charge, along with conversion and fraud statutes, against hackers who \"steal\" information from a protected computer. This paragraph overlaps with false statement and false identification statutes when access is gained through false means. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the USA PATRIOT Act covers cyber offenses without requiring intent to steal, providing a serious charge against hackers who access protected computers. It overlaps with false statement and false identification statutes when access is gained through deceptive means. The provision protects information from \"protected computers\" used in interstate and foreign commerce, with a broad definition that includes Internet communications. The USA PATRIOT Act broadens the definition of protected computer information to include data on computers overseas that affect foreign commerce. Federal theft statutes may apply to hackers stealing information, depending on the type of property involved. Prosecution under \u00a72314 for theft of information stored in a computer requires a physical connection to the stolen goods being transported across state lines. Prosecuting computer intrusions under theft statutes like 18 U.S.C. 641 may be a better fit than the interstate transportation of stolen goods statute. The misappropriation of government property under \u00a7641 requires proving the defendant stole something of value belonging to the United States with intent to deprive the owner of its use. This statute has been applied to property lacking physical features, and overlaps with the Economic Espionage Act when unauthorized access involves a trade secret. The Economic Espionage Act overlaps with theft statutes like 18 U.S.C. 641 when unauthorized access involves a trade secret. It makes stealing trade secrets a federal crime if they have value and are related to interstate or foreign commerce. The Act requires the information to be secret and the owner to take steps to maintain its confidentiality. This Act is effective in preventing computerized burglary in commercial settings. The Economic Espionage Act protects a wide range of trade secret information, including financial, business, scientific, and technical data. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine. Unauthorized downloading from a protected computer may also violate copyright law. The violation of copyright law can result in penalties ranging from 1 to 10 years in prison, depending on the extent of the infringement. This includes infringement for commercial advantage, reproduction or distribution of protected works worth over $1,000, and distribution of works intended for commercial distribution. Each form of infringement has its own penalty structure under 18 U.S.C. 2319. The penalties for copyright infringement under 18 U.S.C. 2319 range from 1 to 10 years in prison, with fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Money laundering statutes prohibit various financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, including domestic and international laundering, promoting further offenses, and spending over $10,000 of the proceeds. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are money laundering predicate offenses, with information acquisition offenses being less likely to generate proceeds compared to fraud and espionage offenses. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) information acquisition offenses are less likely to generate proceeds compared to fraud and espionage offenses. It involves knowingly causing damage without authorization to a protected computer, accessing a protected computer without authorization and recklessly causing damage, or intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization and causing damage and loss. Offenses under 1030(a)(5) involve dual intent to intrude and cause damage, with three distinguishable computer damage offenses. The feature added in 1996 and amended in the USA PATRIOT and Homeland Security Acts addresses intentional damage to a protected computer through unauthorized access. It includes causing damage without authorization, accessing a protected computer recklessly, and causing damage and loss through intentional unauthorized access. The law holds individuals accountable for any resulting damage regardless of intent, reaching both direct and indirect damage. Proof of transmission is required for intentional damage offenses, with circumstantial evidence being sufficient. Transmission also includes installing a destructive program. The transmission of a destructive program must be done knowingly and with the conscious purpose of causing damage. Unauthorized access may involve exceeding authorized access, while reckless and simple provisions only apply to outsiders. Damage is a common element in offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(5). The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act expanded the scope of damage offenses to include cases of serious damage, which are treated as felonies when caused intentionally or recklessly. The crimes under paragraph 1030(a)(5) involve intentionally or recklessly causing computer damage, which can now be treated as a misdemeanor for less serious damage. Proof of both damage and loss is required for the simple damage offense. Loss includes costs incurred by the victim due to the offense. There is no \"exceeds authorization\" element in these crimes. The crimes under paragraph 1030(a)(5) involve causing computer damage without the element of \"exceeds authorization.\" Computer damage is a federal crime under this paragraph only if it involves a \"protected computer,\" which includes computers used exclusively for the government, financial institutions, or in interstate commerce. The legislative history of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act shows that computer damage must affect interstate or foreign commerce. This requirement was added in 1994 to address the issue of hackers attacking computers within their own state but still impacting interstate commerce. The internet's inherently interstate nature means that a computer used to access it falls under this jurisdiction. The 1994 change to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act addressed the issue of hackers impacting interstate commerce. The internet's interstate nature means any computer used to access it falls under Congress's power to regulate. The phrase \"affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" only requires a slight impact on commerce. The scope of protection for federal government computers is uncertain, as terms are not clearly defined. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's scope of protection for federal government computers is uncertain, as terms are not clearly defined. The definition of financial institutions protected under the Act differs slightly from the general definition in Title 18. There is a question regarding whether Congress intended to preclude overseas application of jurisdiction for causing serious damage to computers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act punishes causing serious damage recklessly or intentionally, with harsher penalties for repeat offenders. This includes imprisonment for various terms and fines, depending on the severity of the offense. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for repeat offenders. Penalties also include imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for offenses causing significant loss or harm. Additionally, intentional access that recklessly causes damage can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for repeat offenders. Penalties also include imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for offenses causing significant loss or harm. Additionally, intentional access that recklessly causes damage can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for repeat offenders. Penalties also include imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) for offenses causing significant loss or harm. For violations of the Act, imprisonment for not more than 1 year and/or a fine of not more than $100,000 (not more than $200,000 for an organization) may be imposed. The legislative history of the Act explains the rationale behind the damage thresholds set in the law. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment and fines for repeat offenders causing significant loss or harm. The bill defines 'damage' in relation to harm prevention, focusing on financial losses. The presence of a separate hacker prohibition may impact the threshold for penalties. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for offenses, including imprisonment and fines for repeat offenders causing significant loss or harm. The USA PATRIOT Act clarifies the definition of \"loss\" to include costs incurred in responding to an offense and restoring data, which can be used to reach the $5,000 threshold for penalties. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"loss\" to include costs incurred in responding to an offense and restoring data, reaching the $5,000 threshold for penalties. The Act also defined damage-loss victims as \"persons,\" including individuals and legal entities. The inclusion of computer tampering causing physical harm or threats to public safety is a new addition, aiming to address evolving threats in the digital age. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act addresses cyber attacks by making it a felony to use spyware or keyloggers to damage multiple computers. This ensures severe punishment for identity thieves. Juvenile offenses are more likely to be handled at the state level. The Sentencing Guidelines in cases of damage offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5) have real consequences, with specific enhancements for intentional damage and multiple victims. Confiscation of property related to the offense is possible, and restitution is mandatory for fraud or property damage violations. Confiscation of property under 18 U.S.C. 1030 may become more common, especially for damage offenses. Offenders of paragraph 1030(a)(5) may face civil liability for serious harm caused, with victims having a two-year window to seek damages and equitable relief. Damages for medical records, physical injury, endangering public safety, or government computer damage may include compensatory damages beyond economic damages. Recovery may be based on harm exceeding $5,000. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"person\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030, limiting it to individuals, not including governmental entities. This resolved ambiguity in the law and provided clarity on who can seek damages for violations of the section. The USA PATRIOT Act defined \"person\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030 as any individual, firm, corporation, educational institution, or legal entity. It also outlined the types of losses that could lead to civil liability and clarified that subsection 1030(g) does not cover damages from negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware or software. Additionally, it specified that offenses designated as federal crimes of terrorism have specific consequences. The USA PATRIOT Act defined \"person\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030 as any individual, firm, corporation, educational institution, or legal entity. Offenses classified as federal crimes of terrorism under 1030(a) trigger specific consequences, including an 8-year statute of limitations, life term of supervised release, and presumption against bail pre-trial. Aggravated identity theft in relation to a federal crime of terrorism carries a maximum 5-year imprisonment. Providing maritime transportation to an individual intending terrorism is a separate federal crime punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life. The RICO Act outlaws patterned commission of predicate offenses to acquire or conduct enterprise affairs affecting commerce, with offenders facing up to 20 years in prison. Any RICO predicate offense is also a money laundering predicate offense. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting violations of federal crimes of terrorism are separate crimes with specific consequences. The RICO Act prohibits patterned commission of predicate offenses to acquire or conduct enterprise affairs affecting commerce, with offenders facing up to 20 years in prison. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting violations of federal crimes of terrorism are separate crimes with specific consequences. Violating federal statutes related to damage or destruction of federal property, financial institutions, or property used in interstate or foreign commerce can result in penalties similar to those who commit the substantive offense. There is uncertainty regarding the application of general statutes to protect intangible property, such as information in computer storage. Several statutes outlawing damage or destruction may not apply due to specific means of destruction or protection of particular kinds of property. Section 2071 makes it a federal crime to unlawfully conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy government records. Section 2071 of the RICO Act makes it a federal crime to unlawfully conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy government records, including computer-stored records. The statute covers actions that meet the criteria of obliteration or destruction, involving any record filed with a federal officer. The phrase \"conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy\" may extend to electronic destruction, fitting under \"obliterate\" or \"destroy.\" The statute may protect only tangible items, as \"mutilate\" has physical connotations, but one court ruled that photocopying government records does not violate the statute. Section 2071 of the RICO Act prohibits the removal or destruction of government records to prevent any conduct that deprives the government of the use of its documents. Violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to three years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Section 1361 makes it a federal crime to willfully injure or commit any depredation against any property of the United States. Section 1361 of the RICO Act prohibits the willful injury or destruction of any property belonging to the United States. Offenders can be prosecuted even if they did not know the property belonged to the government. The punishment for damaging federal property is imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Additionally, willful interference with federal communications systems is also prohibited. The RICO Act prohibits the willful injury or destruction of any property belonging to the United States, punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Interference with federal communications systems is also prohibited under \u00a71362, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine. Federal statutes protect financial institutions from theft but not property damage, except for Section 1030 which includes provisions to protect financial institution property. Transportation statutes cover computerized damage or destruction to property in interstate commerce, with provisions broad enough to reach computer systems incidental to transportation facilities. The RICO Act prohibits willful injury or destruction of US property, with penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine. Federal statutes protect financial institutions from theft, while transportation statutes cover computerized damage to property in interstate commerce. The provisions aim to prevent damage or destruction of computer systems in transportation facilities that could endanger safety. The federal law prohibits attacks on mass transit and destruction of motor vehicle facilities, with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine. Federal jurisdiction for prosecution exists if the offense occurs within American territorial waters or involves American vessels or individuals. Computer abuse that damages or destroys motor traffic control systems in a manner threatening human safety falls under federal law, including Section 33 of 18 U.S.C. Other federal crimes may be implicated by damaging computer systems used in interstate or foreign commerce, such as damage to energy facilities or interference with communications or weather satellites. Most states also outlaw damaging computer equipment or systems. RICO predicate offenses include damaging a protected computer to impair medical care, cause physical injury, or threaten public health or safety, as well as damaging governmental computer systems. RICO violations involve conducting business through patterned commission of predicate offenses, punishable by forfeiture of property, imprisonment, fines, and civil liability. Federal money laundering statutes prohibit domestic and international laundering of proceeds from federal crimes. The federal money laundering statutes prohibit domestic and international laundering of proceeds from federal crimes, including specified unlawful activities. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are all money laundering predicate offenses, with computer damage offenses being less likely to generate proceeds compared to fraud and espionage offenses. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) of the federal statutes outlaws fraud by computer intrusion, targeting protected computers used in interstate or foreign commerce, by the United States Government, or by financial institutions. The legislation prohibits unauthorized access to these computers with the intent to defraud and obtain anything of value. Congress has expanded the jurisdiction to include computers affecting interstate or foreign commerce, reinforcing the committee's interpretation. Congress expanded the jurisdiction to include computers affecting interstate or foreign commerce, reinforcing the committee's interpretation. The definition of protected computer anticipates expansive coverage, but there may be doubt regarding the inclusion of computers from the legislative and judicial branches or independent federal agencies. The definition of protected computer in the jurisdiction expansion by Congress anticipates broad coverage, but there is uncertainty about including computers from legislative and judicial branches or independent federal agencies. The interpretation of terms like \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in the statute has led to differing court opinions. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was enacted in 1986 with the intent element of \"knowingly and with intent to defraud.\" The phrase \"thereby furthers a fraud\" ensures that computer use is central to a criminal scheme. The requirement that the value of converted property exceed $5,000 prevents mere computer trespassing from being prosecuted as fraud. The case law confirms the difficulty of prosecuting computer trespassing as fraud under paragraph 1030(a)(4) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. United States v. Czubinski overturned a conviction due to lack of proof of defrauding the government. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The same sentencing guideline covers both fraud and damage under paragraph 1030(a)(4) and (a)(5), with escalators based on the amount of loss inflicted. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized use of government, bank, or interstate/foreign commerce computers for fraud. Conviction requires victim restitution and may lead to confiscation of assets. Victims can seek compensatory damages and injunctive relief. The wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343, is also relevant in cases involving theft or fraud. The wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343, condemns the use of interstate or foreign wire communications to defraud another of \"money or property,\" which may include confidential information. Section 1029 of Title 18 (credit card fraud) and Section 1030 (computer fraud) share a common history and jurisdictional base. Section 1029 of Title 18, known as credit card fraud, was established in 1984 under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. It applies to offenses that impact interstate or foreign commerce and prohibits the deception of commercial computer systems using an \"access device\" to acquire cash, credit, merchandise, or services. An access device includes various identifiers and requires intent to defraud for criminal liability. Criminal liability under \u00a71029 requires the offender to know their actions will deprive another of something of value and intend for that deprivation to occur. Section 1029 covers misuse of access devices, conduct in anticipation of misuse, and attempts or conspiracies to commit these violations. Misuse crimes include use of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices with intent to defraud, resulting in a loss or gain over $1,000 in a year. The offenses extend to misconduct affecting interstate commerce. The offenses under \u00a71029 involve criminal acts done knowingly and with intent to defraud, such as possession of counterfeit access devices, offering unauthorized access information, and using illegal telecommunications equipment. These offenses are separate and extend to misconduct affecting interstate commerce. Paragraph 1029 of the law addresses offenses involving knowingly committing fraud, such as possessing counterfeit access devices or using unauthorized access information. It also covers using illegal telecommunications equipment. Attempting or conspiring to commit these offenses are separate crimes with varying penalties. Attempt carries the same penalties as the completed offense, while conspiracy has lesser penalties. The maximum penalties are determined by the underlying violations of \u00a71029. The law addresses offenses involving fraud, including possession of counterfeit access devices, unauthorized access information, and illegal telecommunications equipment. Conspiracy to defraud the United States is also a federal crime with wide-ranging implications. The lesser known branch of the statute reaches any conspiracy to obstruct a lawful function of the government through deceitful means, with at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Federal criminal statutes proscribe fraud in various forms, including unauthorized manipulation of federal computers as part of a scheme to defraud. Several federal criminal statutes outlaw defrauding financial institutions, including bank fraud provisions like 18 U.S.C. 1344. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, broadens coverage for fraudulent email activities and allows prosecution of hackers using email for fraudulent purposes. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, prohibits accessing protected computers to send deceptive commercial emails, altering email headers, using false identification for multiple email accounts, and conspiring to do so. Offenders face imprisonment for up to 5 years and fines up to $100,000. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, prohibits deceptive commercial emails and email header alterations. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 5 years and fines up to $100,000. Money laundering statutes outlaw various financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, with fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Confiscation of property used in the offense is also possible. The money laundering statutes prohibit various financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, with fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Financial transactions broadly defined for money laundering purposes encompass virtually every transfer of wealth affecting interstate or foreign commerce. To establish \"promotion,\" the government needs to show little more than that the transaction is intended to further the illicit scheme. The illicit scheme involves engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived property worth at least $10,000, knowing it is from unlawful activity. The predicate offenses are the same as for money laundering, with a focus on transactions affecting interstate or foreign commerce. Most states also have laws against computer fraud, including threats to damage or obtain information from protected computers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits the transmission of threats or demands related to damaging a protected computer or obtaining unauthorized information. Congress added this provision in 1996 to address the lack of clarity in existing laws regarding computer operations and data protection. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits threats or demands related to damaging a protected computer or obtaining unauthorized information. It includes subparagraphs enacted in 2008 to cover situations where criminals threaten to disclose stolen information unless paid off. The Act requires interstate or foreign commerce transmission for prosecution and targets protected computers used in interstate commerce, by the federal government, or financial institutions. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits threats related to damaging a protected computer or obtaining unauthorized information. It covers situations where criminals threaten to disclose stolen information unless paid off. The Act requires interstate or foreign commerce transmission for prosecution and targets protected computers used in interstate commerce, by the federal government, or financial institutions. The 2001 amendment expanded the definition of \"protected computer\" to include those located outside the United States affecting interstate or foreign commerce. Congress intended to close the gap in the law by penalizing threats directed against computers and computer systems. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to cover interstate or international transmission of threats against computers and computer systems, including any interference with normal operation, data corruption, or demanding money for data decryption. Threat statutes provide insight into defining a \"threat,\" which can include political hyperbole but still constitute a true threat. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to cover threats against computers and computer systems, including data breaches and extortionate demands. The level of intent required for a violation of this act differs from fraud provisions. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to cover threats against computers and computer systems, including data breaches and extortionate demands. Violations of paragraph 1030(a)(7) require intent to extort, punishable by imprisonment and fines. Victims can claim damages under subsection 1030(g), with the general fraud/damage sentencing guideline applying. The general fraud/damage sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1, applies to violations of paragraph 1030(a)(7) for extortion offenses. Property used in extortion can be confiscated, and offenders may have to pay restitution. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting are treated similarly to other violations of 1030(a). Attempting or conspiring to violate 1030(a)(7) is a separate crime with penalties. Circumstances determine if violations could be prosecuted under the Hobbs Act, which prohibits extortion affecting commerce. The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion that affects commerce, with minimal impact on interstate or foreign commerce needed for jurisdiction. Extortion is defined as obtaining property through force, violence, or fear. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) prohibits extortionate acquisition of property through threats to damage computer systems or data. This is similar to the Hobbs Act but specific to computer-related extortion. The Hobbs Act and paragraph 1030(a)(7) prohibit extortion that affects commerce, with a focus on threats to damage computer systems or data. Federal statutes like 18 U.S.C. 875, 876, 877, and 880 also prohibit threats against property with extortionate intent, punishing offenders with imprisonment and fines. The term \"thing of value\" is broadly interpreted in federal criminal law. The courts interpret the term \"thing of value\" broadly in federal criminal law, especially in cases of mail and wire fraud. While schemes involving intangibles like honest services or state-issued licenses may not always be considered property, schemes involving confidential information are more likely to be prosecuted. Financial transactions related to computer-related extortion can be prosecuted under money laundering laws. Extortion that affects commerce, particularly threats to damage computer systems or data, is prohibited by the Hobbs Act and paragraph 1030(a)(7). Other federal statutes also prohibit threats against property with extortionate intent. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) prohibits computer-related extortion that may lead to prosecution under money laundering laws or RICO predicates like the Hobbs Act or the Travel Act. It involves trafficking in passwords to access computers without authorization, with penalties for offenders. This provision addresses hacker practices of sharing passwords for unauthorized access to computer systems. The paragraph discusses the provisions of Paragraph 1030(a)(7) which prohibits computer-related extortion and trafficking in passwords without authorization. It provides distinct advantages such as clearer coverage of government computers, plea bargaining room, a means to prevent posting access to confidential systems, and a basis for private enforcement. The elements of the crime include knowingly and with intent to defraud, trafficking in a computer. The paragraph discusses the provisions of Paragraph 1030(a)(6) which prohibits trafficking in computer passwords with intent to defraud, affecting federal computers or interstate commerce. There is uncertainty regarding the protection of legislative and judicial branch computers under this paragraph. The intent element in paragraph 1030(a)(6) is the same as in credit card fraud proscriptions, requiring knowledge and intent to defraud. Offenses are punishable by imprisonment and fines, with subsequent offenses carrying harsher penalties. U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1 covers violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6) like fraud and damage under other paragraphs. The sentencing guideline U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1 covers violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6) (traffic in passwords) similar to fraud and damage under other paragraphs. Proceeds and property traceable to these offenses are subject to confiscation, and defendants must pay restitution. Victims can seek damages for losses over $5,000, including lost revenues and costs of damage assessment. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) is not a RICO predicate offense but is a money laundering predicate offense. Offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(6) are money laundering predicate offenses, but not RICO predicate offenses. Violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6) may lead to RICO prosecution if proceeds are laundered or if they also involve access device provisions, wire fraud, or other crimes. Brokering computer passwords alone may not build a criminal enterprise, but combined with other crimes, it could be part of a pattern used to operate such an enterprise. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of restricted data that could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. This law essentially mirrors existing federal espionage laws and punishes those who communicate, deliver, or retain such information. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of information harmful to the U.S. or beneficial to a foreign nation. This law merges elements of espionage and computer abuse, prohibiting the disclosure or retention of classified information acquired through unauthorized computer access. The validity of federal criminal laws like this depends on a clear connection to powers granted by the Constitution to the national government. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act prohibits unauthorized disclosure of information harmful to the U.S. or beneficial to a foreign nation. Offenders must purposefully transmit or retain information that could injure the United States or benefit another country, obtained through unauthorized computer access. Violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The general espionage sentencing guideline applies to these offenses. The general espionage sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a72M3.2, applies to violations of paragraph 1030(a)(1) which can result in a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations) and imprisonment ranging from 8 to 24.33 years, depending on the severity of the offense. Offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(1) are considered federal crimes of terrorism, with a minimum sentencing level of 32 and potential lifetime supervision by probation authorities. Committing this offense in conjunction with aggravated identity theft or RICO can lead to sentencing enhancements or additional charges. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) offenses can lead to sentencing enhancements or additional charges when committed with aggravated identity theft, RICO, money laundering, maritime transportation of terrorists, or providing support for terrorist organizations. Proceeds and property used in the offense are subject to confiscation, and defendants may be ordered to pay restitution. Attempting, aiding, or conspiring to violate this paragraph carries similar penalties as committing the substantive offense. Attempting to violate paragraph 1030(a)(7) is a separate crime, with penalties of up to 5 years imprisonment under the general conspiracy statute. Conviction under the general conspiracy statute for espionage prosecutions is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years. There have been no reported cases under paragraph 1030(a)(1), as cases prosecutable under this paragraph would likely fall under espionage statutes. The espionage statutes outlaw gathering and disseminating defense information, gathering and disseminating defense information for a foreign country, and disclosing classified information concerning government cryptography or communications intelligence. Section 793 of the espionage statutes establishes six distinct offenses related to national defense information, including intruding upon military facilities, copying documents, unlawful receipt and dissemination of information, unauthorized possession, and negligence in handling information. Violations of this section can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Section 794 addresses similar transgressions. Section 794 subjects offenses similar to those in \u00a7793 to harsher penalties if they involve gathering national defense information for a foreign nation or to harm the United States, especially in wartime. Conspirators face the same penalties, and property related to the violation is subject to forfeiture. Section 798 protects military and diplomatic codes and government code breaking, punishing unlawful dissemination of classified information with imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The economic espionage prohibition, 18 U.S.C. 1831, prohibits stealing trade secrets for a foreign entity, with offenders facing up to 15 years in prison and a higher fine. The economic espionage prohibition, 18 U.S.C. 1831, prohibits stealing trade secrets for a foreign entity, with offenders facing up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000,000. The curr_chunk discusses unauthorized access to computers and obtaining information without permission from financial institutions, consumer reporting agencies, government departments, and protected computers. The curr_chunk discusses unauthorized access to protected computers, intentional damage caused without authorization, and fraudulent trafficking of password information. The section discusses the punishment for unauthorized access to protected computers, intentional damage, and fraudulent trafficking of password information. The punishment for offenses under subsection (a) of this section includes fines, imprisonment up to ten years, or both.
