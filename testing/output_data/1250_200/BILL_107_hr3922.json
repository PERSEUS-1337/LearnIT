The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" addresses corporate expatriation to avoid US income tax by defining domestic corporations and partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' refers to a transaction where a foreign acquiring corporation obtains most of the assets of a domestic corporation, and after the transaction, over 80% of the acquiring corporation's stock is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation. In certain cases, a lower stock ownership requirement of 50 percent, instead of 80 percent, applies to a nominally foreign corporation if it lacks substantial business activities in the foreign country where it is organized and if its stock is publicly traded in the United States. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' includes a transaction where a nominally foreign acquiring corporation buys properties of a domestic partnership, with more than 80% of its stock held by former partners post-transaction. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a transaction where a foreign acquiring corporation purchases assets of a domestic partnership, with over 80% of its stock owned by former partners after the transaction. Special rules apply to related transactions and stock ownership within the acquiring corporation's affiliated group. The text discusses the definition of a \"nominally foreign corporation\" and an \"expanded affiliated group\" for tax purposes. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to modify corporate tax rates under section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment allows the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust corporate tax rates under section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 based on revenue estimates. It applies to corporate expatriation transactions completed after September 11, 2001, and also to transactions completed on or before that date with respect to taxable years. The amendment also applies to corporate expatriation transactions completed on or before September 11, 2001, but only for taxable years of the acquiring corporation starting after December 31, 2003."
