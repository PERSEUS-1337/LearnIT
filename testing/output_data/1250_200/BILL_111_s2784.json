    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF ESTATE TAX AS IN EFFECT IN 2009.\" is a concise summary of a specific section related to the estate tax. The unified credit against gift tax is amended to remove the $1,000,000 exclusion amount. The exclusion equivalent of the unified credit against estate tax is set at $3,500,000. The applicable exclusion amount for estate tax is $3,500,000 and the maximum estate tax rate is set at 45 percent. The estate tax applicable exclusion amount is amended to remove certain items and paragraphs, with adjustments made to the credit allowed against the tax imposed. Residents of possessions of the United States are also subject to specific credit calculations. The estate tax applicable exclusion amount is amended to reflect differences in unified credit resulting from different tax rates. Modifications are made to the computation of tax, with adjustments described in subsection (g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Modifications are made to the gift tax payable to reflect different tax rates at the decedent's death, affecting the computation of tax and credit allowed against it. Modifications to the gift tax include changes to tax rates at the decedent's death and the credit allowed against it. These amendments apply to estates of decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made after December 31, 2009. Additionally, certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 related to estate tax are repealed. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is to be applied as if certain provisions and amendments had never been enacted. Amendments to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 are made, including the repeal of sections 2011, 2057, and 2604. The table of sections in the Internal Revenue Code is amended by striking items relating to sections 2011, 2057, and 2604. SEC. 2. Unified credit increased by unused unified credit of deceased spouse. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include new paragraphs regarding the applicable exclusion amount and basic exclusion amount for tax purposes. The basic exclusion amount is set at $3,500,000 and will be adjusted for inflation for decedents after 2010. The new paragraphs in the Internal Revenue Code define the aggregate deceased spousal unused exclusion amount as the lesser of the basic exclusion amount or the total of unused exclusions from deceased spouses. The deceased spousal unused exclusion amount is the excess of the deceased spouse's unused exclusion after 2009 for the surviving spouse. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple. The exclusion amount for a surviving spouse is the difference between the deceased spouse's basic exclusion amount and the tentative tax amount on the estate. A deceased spousal unused exclusion amount can only be used by the surviving spouse if the executor files an estate tax return with the computed amount and makes an irrevocable election. The IRS may examine a deceased spouse's return to determine the unused exclusion amount after the expiration of the assessment period. Regulations will be prescribed to implement this provision. Amendments are made to section 2505(a) of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the exclusion amount for a surviving spouse. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include changes to the applicable credit amount, basic exclusion amount, and effective date for estates, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts after December 31, 2009. The Senate believes that any decrease in Federal revenue from this Act should be fully offset."
