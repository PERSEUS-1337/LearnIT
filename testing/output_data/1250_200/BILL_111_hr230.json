    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009\" and includes provisions for affordable refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. The \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009\" mandates that the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation implement a program to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages on single-family housing. Lenders must offer mortgages for purchase, which will be evaluated by the enterprises to determine if they meet the criteria for qualified mortgages. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will establish policies and procedures for this program. The Director mandates approval of lenders for advance commitments to purchase qualified mortgages. A qualified mortgage is defined as a qualified refinancing mortgage or a qualified new mortgage, with specific requirements for single-family housing and principal residence occupancy. The mortgagor must occupy the property as their principal residence. The mortgage must be used to pay off existing indebtedness on the same property from a first mortgage originated before January 1, 2008. The mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually and a term to maturity. The qualified new mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually and a term to maturity of 30-40 years. Underwriting standards set by the Director must be met, and all prepayment penalties and fees related to default must be waived. The mortgage requirements include meeting specific terms, using the loan amount for property purchase, and originating after the enactment of the Act. Exceptions to underwriting standards are allowed for purchasing and securitizing qualified mortgages. Each enterprise must securitize mortgages as required. Securitization requirements for enterprises involve setting aside qualified mortgages for issuance and sale of securities approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Securities can be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates with determined maturities and interest rates. These securities are considered exempt securities under SEC laws. The Federal Reserve System will establish a credit facility to provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to securities issued by the United States. Enterprises must ensure that mortgages set aside are sufficient to make timely principal and interest payments on securities issued. Securities issued by enterprises are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt of the United States. The Federal Reserve System will provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to Treasury securities. Enterprises are not required to purchase mortgages after December 31, 2010. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Director refers to the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Enterprise includes the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Secretary is the Secretary of the Treasury."
