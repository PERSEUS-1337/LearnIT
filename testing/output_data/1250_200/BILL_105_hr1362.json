    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting in 1998. The project involves reimbursing the Department of Veterans Affairs for healthcare services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to waive certain Medicare requirements for this project. Targeted facilities within the Department of Veterans Affairs will be selected for participation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The selection plan will prioritize facilities suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals based on potential demand and capability. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate facilities in geographic service areas for a demonstration project targeting Medicare-eligible veterans. Selected facilities must have billing and accounting capability, quality care indicators, patient satisfaction, and meet relevant criteria. At least one facility near a closed military medical base will be chosen. The Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100-526; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) establishes a voluntary demonstration project for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. Cost-sharing requirements will be the same as those for targeted Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities, and payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under a demonstration project at a rate of 95 percent of Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under a demonstration project at a rate of 95 percent of Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The annual limit on Medicare payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the project is $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the VA fails to maintain a certain level of effort in providing medical services for targeted veterans. The maintenance of effort level for each fiscal year is determined based on the previous year's level, with adjustments made according to changes in VA medical care appropriations and targeted veterans' expenditures. If the VA fails to meet this level, Medicare payments for services provided under a demonstration project may be reduced. The VA must maintain a certain level of medical care appropriations for targeted veterans each fiscal year. Failure to meet this level may result in reduced Medicare payments for services provided under a demonstration project. The plan developed under Public Law 104-204 defines VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs on hospital care and medical services for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. Expenditures for medical examinations for claims adjudication and services reimbursed under a demonstration project are not included. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, must monitor the impact on costs to the Medicare program to ensure no increase in cost. The Secretaries, with the Comptroller General, monitor Medicare program expenditures for targeted veterans during a demonstration project. The Comptroller General audits and reports on any cost increases to Congress annually. The Secretaries, along with the Comptroller General, oversee Medicare program expenditures for targeted veterans during a demonstration project. If costs increase, steps will be taken to recoup the amount and prevent future increases, including payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Medicare trust funds. The Secretaries oversee Medicare program expenditures for targeted veterans during a demonstration project. Steps may be taken to recoup costs and prevent future increases, including payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Medicare trust funds. This may involve suspending or terminating the demonstration project or adjusting the percentage under subsection (a)(1). SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity evaluates the health services demonstration project annually. Reports are submitted to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year, assessing costs, quality of care compliance, and facility participation costs. The Secretaries must submit a report to Congress within six months of the final report on a health services demonstration project. The report will include recommendations on extending or making the project permanent, expanding to cover more sites, and increasing reimbursement amounts. The Secretaries will recommend whether to expand the project to cover additional sites and increase reimbursement amounts, and if the terms should be continued or modified. A report on a new demonstration project for payment to managed health-care plans for targeted medicare-eligible veterans will be submitted to Congress by March 1, 1999. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"demonstration project,\" \"geographic service area,\" \"Medicare program,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting jointly. A \"targeted medicare-eligible veteran\" is a veteran entitled to certain Medicare benefits with income between specified thresholds."
