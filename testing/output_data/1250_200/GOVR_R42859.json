The DOD and military services have spent millions on alternative fuels, with the Navy proposing a significant investment. This report also provides data on DOD's alternative fuels purchases and the status of testing platforms for alternative fuel blends. This report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms, and certification for fleet-wide use. It also discusses the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, legislative actions related to DOD alternative fuels efforts, and appropriated funding. For more details on the Navy's biofuel production efforts, refer to CRS Report R42568. For a comprehensive overview of DOD's operational energy efforts, refer to CRS Report R42558. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. This includes leading alternative fuel activities, overseeing investments, issuing guidelines, and collaborating with other federal agencies. Sharon Burke issued a memorandum outlining the goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy on July 5, 2012. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to ensure military readiness, improve battlespace effectiveness, and increase fuel source options. Alternative fuels must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. Desired characteristics include non-food crop feedstock production and lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. DOD investments in alternative fuels must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The DOD's alternative fuels policy requires investments in alternative fuels to be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs reviews proposed budgets to ensure they align with the operational energy strategy. Future investments in alternative fuels will undergo a rigorous evaluation process. Alternative fuels development initiatives will follow three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Evaluation by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. The proposal for alternative fuels will be reviewed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs or jointly by other defense offices. Alternative fuels will compete with petroleum products for purchases, based on meeting requirements at best value. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy, with a goal of having at least 25% of energy for tactical power generation derived from alternative and renewable sources by 2028. The Air Force and Navy have set ambitious goals for increasing the use of alternative fuels. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016 and test all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Navy plans to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" running on alternative fuel blends by 2016 as part of its energy goals. The Navy aims to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" strike group of ships and aircraft using alternative fuel blends by 2016. They also plan to meet 50% of their total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020, with a goal to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat to 38 million barrels of oil equivalent per year. DLA Energy has procured approximately 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the military since 2007. The Department of Defense (DOD) has purchased 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force to test engine performance and certify for use in service fleets. The purchases, totaling $48 million, include Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The services have bought various types of alternative fuels, with the Air Force also purchasing fuels from the Fischer-Tropsch process. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies, including DOD, from certain fuel purchases. The DOD has purchased alternative fuels for testing and certification in service fleets, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and alcohol-to-jet fuels. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act prohibits certain fuel purchases by federal agencies. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army is testing 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8 for fleet-wide use. They aim to certify these fuels by 2014 and are also working on Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army plans to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is testing biofuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Air Force and Navy have been testing various biofuels for their fleets, including HEFA fuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and ships, with certification expected in early 2013. Testing of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is ongoing, with completion expected by the end of 2013. Other alternative fuels like pyrolysis oils and direct sugar to hydrocarbon will continue to be tested in the future. In June 2011, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to support the development of alternative fuels. In June 2011, the Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The MOU aims to assist in the production of advanced drop-in biofuels that meet military specifications, are price competitive with petroleum, and have no significant impact on the food supply. The Navy and Department of Energy plan to fund this initiative with $340 million in federal funds for capital investment and production, with industry cost-sharing. The Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $171 million through the Commodity. The government funding for the biofuels production initiative is anticipated to be $510 million over three years, with contributions from the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) was released in June 2012 with an initial funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases: Phase 1 for planning and preliminary designs, and Phase 2 for construction and commissioning. The government funding for biofuels production is expected to be $510 million over three years, with contributions from the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture. Phase 1 awards for biofuel production facilities are set to be announced in March 2013, with Phase 2 offering up to three awards of $70 million each for construction and testing. Successful proposals must meet various requirements, including a 50% cost share, domestic production of advanced biofuels, compliance with energy regulations, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons per year. The funding includes contributions from the DOD and DOE. The DOD's FY2013 budget request includes a request for the DPA fund and $40 million from DOE to support the MOU between the Navy, DOE, and USDA. It does not include $171 million of USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding or limiting DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels and appropriations related to the Navy's biofuel production efforts under the DPA. The DOD's FY2013 budget request includes funding for alternative fuels and biofuel production. H.R. 4310 and S. 3254 had provisions regarding DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels, with the Senate version not restricting DOD's abilities. Amendments removed restrictive provisions, and the enrolled FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act stated the amounts available to DOD. The enrolled FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / P.L. 112-239) prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for biofuel refinery construction without matching contributions from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Navy and Department of Energy requested appropriations for a joint biofuels production initiative, with the USDA portion funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Navy also requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013, part of the Defense Production Act Fund appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the initiative, while the Senate recommended funding the DPA Fund at $100 million. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $223,531,000 for the DPA Fund, an increase of $134.3 million over the requested amount. The Defense Production Act Fund is appropriated $223,531,000, an increase of $134.3 million over the requested amount. Funding for advanced drop-in biofuels production is reduced by $10 million, with $60 million allocated. Additionally, $20 million is provided for research on lowering emissions of coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force. The conferees allocate $20 million for research to improve coal to liquid fuel emissions as an alternative energy resource. The Department of Defense is exploring alternative energy resources to meet its goals. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to inform Congress before any funds are used. The Department of Energy requested to transfer $40 million into the Defense Production Act Fund for FY2013. The House version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act does not allow this transfer, while the Senate version permits up to $100 million to be transferred. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program was funded at approximately $1.8 billion under the Production Act Fund. Congress has oversight questions regarding the benefits of alternative fuels for the military services, coordination of testing efforts, and the potential impact of a $510 million investment by the Navy. The Navy's $510 million investment in the domestic advanced biofuel industry is being questioned for its impact and coordination with other government agencies. The Department of Defense's efforts to jumpstart the industry are led by the Navy, raising concerns about oversight and coordination of alternative fuel goals within the military services. The role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs in overseeing investments and ensuring coordination is being scrutinized for its effectiveness. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included $150 million for DPA Title III funding, supporting biofuels initiatives. Senate reports encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement by the Department of Defense to ensure adequate production and maximize efficiencies of scale for the best purchase price. They believe that investments in biofuels and alternative energy will benefit the armed forces and the nation, urging the Department to pursue extended multi-year contracts. The Department of Energy is encouraged to pursue extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products to maximize efficiencies of scale and purchase price. The House Appropriations Committee did not authorize the transfer of funds to the Defense Production Act Fund for pilot-scale demonstration projects. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the Department of Energy's joint initiative with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture for commercial diesel and jet biofuels production capacity for defense purposes. They recommended $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, directing the Department to focus on technologies producing fuels and electricity from biomass and crops not used as food. The Committee questioned the justification for Department of Energy funding for the Defense initiative and did not provide funding or legislative language for it in FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended transferring up to $100,000,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund to support the joint biofuel production initiative by the DOD, DOE, and USDA for military use. The report emphasizes the importance of developing innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels to ensure quality and reliability in the supply chain. The Committee supports the collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for military jet and diesel fuels. The Department of Defense's early adoption of alternative fuels is expected to influence the wider marketplace. Provisions in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act exempt the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and limit funds for the production or purchase of alternative fuels. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits Department of Defense funds for alternative fuel production or purchase if costs exceed traditional fossil fuels. The Act allows limited purchases of alternative fuels for fleet certification. Senate bill S. 3254 initially had provisions restricting biofuel procurement, but these were removed via floor amendments. The Senate passed amendments to remove provisions limiting the Department of Defense's procurement of biofuels from S. 3254. The first amendment, sponsored by Senator Mark Udall, struck Section 313, which would have restricted the purchase of alternative fuels exceeding traditional fossil fuel costs. The second amendment, sponsored by Senator Hagan, struck Section 2823, which would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure without specific authorization. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved amendments to remove restrictions on the Department of Defense's procurement of biofuels from S. 3254. Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain sponsored amendments that were passed in votes of 13-12, while a third amendment by Senator Inhofe failed in a tie vote of 13-13. The failed amendment aimed to exempt the Department of Defense from a provision in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Department of Defense is limited in using funds for alternative fuels if they are more expensive than traditional fossil fuels. The Secretary of Defense can purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for certification purposes. Additionally, there is a prohibition on the construction of biofuel refineries by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is restricted from entering into contracts for biofuels refineries or infrastructure without specific authorization by law. Funds for alternative fuels cannot be used if they cost more than traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The Defense Logistics Agency purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million in 2011 to showcase its capabilities. The Department of the Navy made the largest biofuel purchase in government history at $26.66 a gallon to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's ability to use alternative fuels. The high cost of fuel impacts readiness accounts, with every $1 increase per barrel resulting in $31M in additional costs annually. The Department of Defense supports reducing fuel demand through new technologies for increased efficiency and alternative power sources. The committee is concerned about the high costs of biofuels being used for RDTE efforts and directs the Secretary of Defense to develop guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 limits the obligation of Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy. The Department of Defense requires matching contributions from the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture for biofuel refinery construction. $70,000,000 is allocated for advanced drop-in biofuel production in the 2013 fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for alternative energy development in fiscal year 2013 due to budget constraints. However, an additional $100 million is allocated for the Defense Production Act fund to support the U.S. defense industrial base. Priority consideration is given to completing projects initiated in prior years. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, with priority given to completing projects from prior years. The funding includes $60 million for advanced drop-in biofuels and $20 million for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must notify congressional defense committees 30 days before any funds are obligated or spent. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) allocates $20 million for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The funding aims to improve the technology to make it a competitive alternative energy resource in line with the Department of Defense's Operational Energy Strategy. In the Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6), the Department of Energy received funding under a continuing resolution, with Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funded at around $1.8 billion."
