    "content": "Many congressional policymakers are concerned about the adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce to meet various national needs. Congress funds programs to improve STEM skills, encourage students to pursue science and engineering degrees, and provide research experiences at universities. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and potential changes to immigration policies related to visas and green cards for the S&E workforce. The report provides information on employment, wages, and unemployment for various science and engineering occupations, including computer, mathematical, engineering, life science, physical science, and S&E management. It includes data for 2016 and trends from 2012-2016. Congress is considering policies and programs to address the nation's needs for scientists and engineers, including potential changes to immigration policies related to visas and green cards. The section \"Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" analyzes changes in S&E employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012-2016. It also discusses projections for S&E occupations from 2016-2026 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The \"Concluding Observations\" section offers stakeholder perspectives for Congress to ensure a sufficient S&E workforce for the 21st century. The definition of S&E occupations varies among experts and organizations, with different terms like STEM workforce used. The size of the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce varies depending on the occupations included in the definition. Estimates range from 6 million to over 21 million individuals. The focus of the policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce is on computer occupations, mathematical occupations, engineers, physical scientists, life scientists, and S&E management occupations. The Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce includes computer occupations, mathematical occupations, engineers, physical scientists, life scientists, and S&E management occupations. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million and is categorized using a modified version of the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) system. The Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce includes various occupations such as computer support specialists, network architects, mathematicians, engineers in various fields, life scientists, and physical scientists. These occupations are categorized using the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) system. The Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce includes various occupations such as computer support specialists, network architects, mathematicians, engineers in various fields, life scientists, and physical scientists. The detailed occupations in the S&E workforce include astronomers, physicists, atmospheric and space scientists, chemists, materials scientists, environmental scientists, geoscientists, hydrologists, and science and engineering managers. Data for these occupations is sourced from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts surveys for over 800 occupations, focusing on employees who are paid a wage or salary. The data does not include self-employed individuals or unpaid family workers. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging the wages of all employees in a specific occupation. The Current Population Survey (CPS) provides unemployment data, while BLS's Employment Projections offer occupational and industry employment projections for 10-year periods. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns for most industries. The OES survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns and CES data on total wage and salary employment. The employment projections consider agricultural industry employment and self-employed individuals. The \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" section covers changes from 2012 to 2016, while the \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on BLS projections. Various factors can impact the U.S. S&E workforce, such as economic conditions, technology development, funding levels, and research changes. The OES survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns and CES data on total wage and salary employment, including agricultural industry employment and self-employed individuals. Factors impacting the U.S. S&E workforce include economic conditions, technology development, funding levels, and research changes. Various factors may affect the comparability of OES data over time, such as changes in classification systems, data collection methods, survey reference periods, and mean wage estimation methodologies. The OES survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns and CES data on total wage and salary employment. Factors impacting the U.S. S&E workforce include economic conditions, technology development, funding levels, and research changes. Changes in classification systems, data collection methods, survey reference periods, and mean wage estimation methodologies may affect the comparability of OES data over time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes estimates based on population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, technological innovation, and other factors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) evaluates occupational projections regularly, considering factors like economic conditions, technological innovation, and changes in business practices. BLS replaced its methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs with a new method for estimating occupational separations due to identified issues with the previous method. Other factors affecting projections include immigration laws, technology advances, and shifts in consumer preferences. In 2016, 6.9 million people were employed in the United States as scientists and engineers, with computer occupations and engineers making up 81% of S&E jobs.

The number of architectural and engineering managers declined during this period. The 10 S&E occupations with the largest employment growth and losses are detailed in tables 5 and 6, respectively. Computer programmers experienced the greatest employment loss among these occupations. The list of 10 S&E occupations with the fastest growth rates includes mathematical science occupations, operations research analysts, and computer occupations. On the other hand, the 10 S&E occupations with the slowest growth rates all have negative growth rates, spanning various occupational groups. Between 2012 and 2016, mean wages for Science and Engineering (S&E) occupational groups grew at a similar pace to overall mean wages, with S&E managers and computer occupations showing the fastest growth rates. Mathematical occupations experienced a small decline in wages, while other S&E groups grew by less than 1.4% CAGR. Unemployment rates for S&E occupational groups are provided in Table 9. Between 2012 and 2016, Science and Engineering (S&E) occupational groups saw mean wage growth similar to overall wages, with S&E managers and computer occupations showing the fastest growth. Unemployment rates for S&E groups were lower than the overall workforce but comparable to other professional occupations like lawyers and physicians. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected occupational employment for 2016-2026. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a significant growth in the science and engineering workforce from 2016 to 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are expected to exit the workforce during this period, creating a total of nearly 2.3 million job openings. Occupational transfers in S&E positions are projected to create an additional 3.7 million job openings. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects significant growth in the science and engineering workforce from 2016 to 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are expected to exit the workforce during this period, creating nearly 2.3 million job openings. An additional 3.7 million job openings will be created by occupational transfers in S&E positions. The BLS projections do not include data for a quantitative analysis of new workers needed for job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers. Multiple occupational transfers are allowed during the 10-year projection period, but only one transfer per year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects significant growth in the science and engineering workforce from 2016 to 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Among the S&E occupational groups, computer occupations are projected to see the largest increase in the number employed, accounting for 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations. Mathematical occupations are projected to have the fastest employment growth. The share of all S&E jobs accounted for by computer occupations is projected to rise to 58.6% in 2026. Mathematical occupations are expected to have the fastest employment growth, increasing their share slightly from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. S&E Managers, Engineers, Life Scientists, and Physical Scientists are projected to have a smaller share of total S&E job growth compared to their share of S&E employment in 2016. In 2016, the projected share of S&E employment for Physical Scientists is 3.7%, down from 3.8% in 2016. The number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce. Labor force exits exceed projected new job growth in most S&E occupational groups. Mathematical occupations are an exception, with job growth expected to exceed labor force exits. During the 2016-2026 period, job growth in S&E occupations is projected to surpass labor force exits. The composition of projected job openings by job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. The top 10 S&E occupations with the highest projected job growth include computer occupations, civil engineers, and mechanical engineers. The top 10 S&E occupations with the smallest projected growth in jobs include computer programmers, while the fastest-growing occupations are statisticians, software developers, and mathematicians. The list also includes various mathematical, computer, physical sciences, and engineering occupations. Additionally, the five non-S&E occupations with the highest growth rates are provided.

The list includes engineering occupations, architectural and engineering managers, and life sciences occupations. Table 15 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings, including computer occupations, engineering occupations, and mathematical occupations. These 10 occupations account for 60.8% of all projected job openings in S&E occupations. Table 16 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the fewest projected job openings, accounting for less than 1% of all S&E job openings during the projection period. Scientists and engineers are crucial for U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and national defense. Congress has enacted programs to support STEM education and increase the number of students pursuing S&E degrees. Policymakers have also looked into attracting more foreign scientists and engineers through visa and immigration policies. Some policymakers aim to boost the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa and immigration policy changes. Views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce vary, with debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, the nature of the shortage, and whether the government should intervene or let market forces address the issue. The debate over the shortage of scientists and engineers in the US continues, with some policymakers advocating for increasing the number of foreign S&E workers through visa and immigration policy changes. However, data does not support claims of a broad shortage, as indicators like employment growth and wage growth do not show a significant deficit. Regardless of shortage status, increasing the number of US scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Jobs in various fields now require higher levels of STEM knowledge, making S&E degrees valuable for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Government interventions in the S&E labor market to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies, such as an oversupply of S&E graduates for limited job opportunities and lower salaries for those who do find S&E jobs. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable and may result in mismatches between students' education and market needs. Unexpected changes in industrial output or employment can further complicate these projections. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to unexpected changes in industrial output or employment, factor substitution, retirement behavior, and government policies. Shortages may exist in certain industries or fields, such as new and emerging S&E fields, cyclical industries, and fields restricted to U.S. citizens. The labor market will resolve these needs through wage adjustments, increased labor supply, or alternative inputs. The potential adverse consequences of even discrete shortages in S&E fields require government interventions to prevent loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry assertions of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs through increased supply of young, lower-cost graduates, leading to a skills mismatch rather than a shortage of people. Employers struggle to meet their S&E workforce needs primarily due to a mismatch in specific skills. Expanding immigration to address the shortage of skills in the science and engineering workforce can help by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers. However, this may also depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as American students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to fewer talented scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Standardized tests used to compare STEM knowledge do not accurately reflect the preparedness of U.S. students for S&E careers. Federal policies can help strengthen K-12 STEM education and address the challenges in the S&E workforce. The federal government plays a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce by considering various perspectives on policies to increase students pursuing S&E degrees, admit foreign scientists and engineers, promote diversity in STEM fields, improve K-12 STEM education, and enhance career counseling for high school students. BLS provides data on the educational composition of S&E occupations to support U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. The American Community Survey (ACS) uses a compressed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, with a crosswalk provided at the end of the appendix. The occupational composition of ACS classifications corresponding to SOC codes for S&E occupations is shown in chart form, with educational levels below associate's degrees grouped as \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes individuals with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma or equivalent, and some college but no degree."
