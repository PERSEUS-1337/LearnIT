The model uses a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weights Generator network to generate weight vectors for novel tasks, outperforming current meta-learning methods in various regression tasks. In few-shot learning for regression tasks, a model is trained to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data.

The contributions include learning sparsifying basis functions from data and conducting experiments on different tasks. The model proposed addresses few-shot regression by using a Basis Function Learner network and a Weights Generator network. It learns basis functions for sparse representation and generates weight vectors for regression tasks. This approach reformulates regression as a few-shot learning problem, allowing for regression on tasks from the same distribution. The success of deep neural networks relies heavily on data availability. Meta learning, also known as learning to learn, is a prominent approach that aims to create an adaptive model across different tasks. It has shown potential in various applications such as style transfer and visual navigation. Meta learning has been particularly useful in few-shot learning problems, where models can adapt to new tasks based on prior experiences. Several meta learning methods have been developed to address few-shot problems, including learning a similarity metric between new test examples and few-shot training samples. Few-shot learning approaches include learning a similarity metric or optimization-based methods to make predictions with limited training samples. Various techniques such as optimal initialization, gradient descent in latent space, and LSTM optimization algorithms have been explored. Generative models have also been proposed to overcome limitations in few-shot settings. Few-shot regression tasks are commonly used in these methods, with experiments typically focusing on sinusoidal and linear regression tasks. In few-shot regression tasks, Neural Processes algorithms model output distributions using Deep Neural Networks. Unlike Variational Autoencoders, they employ a Bayesian approach. Our model uses a deterministic approach by learning basis functions directly. It does not produce latent vectors but predicts using a dot product. Experimental results show our model, based on sparse linear combination of basis functions, outperforms Neural Processes. Our proposed sparse linear representation framework for few-shot regression is compared favorably to Neural Processes. The problem is defined as rapidly regressing to various equations and functions with only a few training samples. Unlike dictionary learning, our approach is continuous and deals with a small percentage of samples. The tasks distribution for regression is continuous. Our proposed sparse linear representation framework for few-shot regression aims to model unknown functions with a small number of training samples. The approach involves learning a sparse representation of the function as a linear combination of basis functions, allowing for accurate approximation with limited data. In sparse linear representation for few-shot regression, the unknown function F(x) is modeled using a set of basis functions. The Maclaurin series expansion and Fourier basis are examples of basis functions that can provide a sparse representation of F(x). Using the Fourier basis allows for a more accurate approximation of sinusoidal functions with fewer terms, making it possible to estimate significant weights with a small number of samples. In sparse linear representation for few-shot regression, the unknown function F(x) is approximated using a set of basis functions {\u03c6 i (x)}. The Basis Function Learner Network encodes the set of {\u03c6 i (x)} for any task drawn from p(T), while the Weights Generator Network maps K training samples of a novel task to a constant vector w. The model, w T \u03a6(x), is used to make predictions for any input x during meta-training. The prediction is generated by taking a dot product between task-specific weights vector, w, and learned basis functions. The loss function consists of a mean-squared error term between validation set labels and predicted values, along with penalty terms on the weights vector w for each task. The penalties include encouraging sparsity in weight vectors and reducing variance. The full loss function includes L1 and L2 regularization terms with weightage factors \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. This approach differs from Elastic Net Regression by focusing on meta-learning tasks instead of a single regression task. The loss function described in the previous section focuses on meta-learning tasks using L1 and L2 regularization terms. In contrast, the current section discusses using the loss function to learn parameters for the Basis Function Learner and Weight Generator networks. Various models are compared based on their performance metrics. In this section, experiments are described, including regression tasks evaluated using a learning rate of 0.001 and the Adam Optimizer. Models are implemented using Tensorflow, with experiments on 1D Heat Equation and 2D Gaussian regression tasks. The Basis Function Learner has two fully connected layers with 40 hidden units, and the loss function includes regularization terms. The model is evaluated on a sinusoidal regression task commonly used in few-shot learning methods. The experiments involve regression tasks using a sinusoidal function with parameters A, b, and \u03c9. The model is trained on tasks with batch size 4 and 60000 iterations for 5, 10, and 20 shot cases. Comparison is made with other few-shot learning methods, and results are shown in Table 1. Two variants of the model are tested based on the size of the Weights Generator. The experimental setup involves two variants of the model based on the size of the Weights Generator. The \"small\" model has B = 1 self-attention blocks and a fully connected layer with 40 hidden units, while the \"large\" model has B = 3 self-attention blocks and a fully connected layer with 40 hidden units. Both MAML and Meta-SGD use a similar architecture with 2 fully connected layers of 40 hidden units. The Neural Process family of methods uses an encoder architecture of 4 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units and a decoder architecture of 2 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units. The methods are also compared against two variants of EMAML. The architecture of the models includes 2 fully connected layers with varying hidden units. The comparison is made against EMAML and BMAML variants with different model sizes. An alternative sinusoidal regression task is also evaluated with increased ranges and added noise terms. The total number of tasks used during training is fixed at 1000. An ensemble version of the model is included with 10 separate instances trained. The experimental setup includes training on 1000 tasks and an ensemble model with 10 instances. Results show outperformance in sinusoidal tasks and testing on MNIST and CelebA datasets for image data comparison. Images are treated as continuous functions with normalized pixel values. During meta-training, K points are randomly sampled from images of size 28 \u00d7 28 in MNIST and 32 \u00d7 32 in CelebA for regression tasks. The MSE is evaluated on remaining pixels in the meta-testing stage. Our method is compared with NP family models using deeper network structures. Models are trained for 500 epochs with batch size 80, and results on 10,000 tasks from meta-testing set are reported in Table 3 with 95% confidence interval. Our method outperforms two of three NP methods and achieves MSE close to the most recent ANP on 10,000 tasks from the meta-testing set. The regression outputs on CelebA image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in challenging tasks. ANP significantly improves upon NP and CNP using cross-attention, which can potentially be applied to our method as well. We provide deeper analysis on the basis functions learned by our method, showing evidence that our method learns a set of sparsifying basis functions corresponding to the regression tasks. By taking only the S largest weights in terms of |w| and their corresponding basis functions, we illustrate the predicted regression function with the combination of only these weights and basis functions. This experiment is conducted on both sinusoidal regression and image completion tasks. Our method demonstrates the sparsity of basis functions by producing accurate predictions with only a fraction of the learned set. Ablation studies focus on the effects of self-attention operations in the Weights Generator and different penalty terms on the loss function. The addition of self-attention operations improves model performance, while varying penalty terms impact the loss function. The study focuses on the effects of self-attention operations in the Weights Generator and different penalty terms on the loss function. Adding self-attention operations improves model performance, while varying penalty terms impact the loss function. The study evaluates the performance of different loss function variants on the sinusoidal regression task. Results show that the combination of both L1 and L2 penalty terms gives the best performance. The model trained with only the L1 loss term has the highest percentage of sparse weights, but the model with both L1 and L2 terms performs better while maintaining a high percentage of near zero weights. The study proposes a few-shot meta learning system for regression tasks based on linear representation of basis functions. A Basis Function Learner network encodes basis functions for the task distribution, while a Weight generator network generates weights from training samples. The model shows competitive performance in various regression tasks, with 22 out of 40 basis functions being non-zero, representing different components of the sinusoidal function. The study demonstrates the importance of certain basis functions in sinusoidal regression tasks by showing the impact of removing them on prediction accuracy. The learned basis functions correspond to different components of sinusoidal functions, with some representing peaks or troughs. Removing just 4 important basis functions led to a less accurate prediction. The Weights Generator Network architecture includes self attention blocks followed by a fully connected layer. Each attention block consists of a self attention operation, two fully connected layers, a residual connection, and layer normalization. The input to the first attention block is the input to the network, while subsequent blocks take outputs from previous blocks. The Weights Generator Network architecture includes self attention blocks with query, key, and value vectors going through a scaled dot-product self-attention operation. The method is also evaluated on a 1D heat Equation task involving modeling temperature distribution in a rod with a heat source. The temperature distribution in a rod with a heat source is modeled using the heat equation. The experiments involve setting L to 5 and sampling K points on the curve. The model is evaluated on 10 shot and 5 shot cases, compared to EMAML and BMAML. Results are presented in Table 6. Additionally, the model is tested on 2D Gaussian regression tasks with mean ranging from (-2, -2) to (2, 2) and standard deviation in both directions. Evaluation is done on 10, 20, and 50 shot cases. The evaluation of the model on 10, 20, and 50 shot cases is presented in Table 7 and qualitative results on CelebA datasets are shown in Figure 7. The RGB images are complex 2D functions, and the regression results from the proposed method are visually better than NP and CNP. The sparse linear representation framework for few shot regression is compared to dictionary learning, focusing on efficient representations of signals. The problem discussed is similar to dictionary learning but with significant differences. In few shot regression, the goal is to predict a continuous function with only a few samples given, making it more challenging than typical dictionary learning algorithms. The basis matrix in this setup has infinite entries and is encoded by the proposed Basis Function Learner network."
