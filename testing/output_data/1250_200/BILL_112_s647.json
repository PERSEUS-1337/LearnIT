    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\". Congress acknowledges that the Secretary of the Interior has conveyed mineral rights in coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. The development of these tracts and other energy resources in the area generates significant public revenues for the State, but the Northern Cheyenne tribal community does not benefit from these revenues despite facing economic hardships and deficits in public services. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe lacks revenue sources to address development impacts and previously sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State, citing violations of Federal laws and trust responsibilities. The Tribe withdrew the suit with the expectation of legislation to address coal development impacts. The Tribe retains claims against the United States for failure to acquire mineral rights on Reservation land when it was expanded in 1900. If mineral rights are conveyed under this Act, the Tribe will waive all legal claims against the United States for the loss of mineral rights. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, depicted on a map dated April 7, 2010. The term \"Federal tracts\" refers to unleased 5,000-acre land outside the Reservation boundaries in the State, depicted on a map dated March 18, 2011. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to a Delaware limited partnership and any successor with ownership interest in coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts. The term \"Reservation\" refers to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The terms defined include Reservation as the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, Secretary as the Secretary of the Interior, State as the State of Montana, and Tribe as the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES.\n\nGreat Northern Properties will convey all mineral interests underlying the Cheyenne tracts to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey all coal rights on Federal tracts to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be immune from State taxation.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. (a) Waiver of Legal Claims.--In exchange for mineral conveyances, the Tribe will waive claims regarding the United States' failure to acquire private mineral interests on the Reservation. \n(b) Condition.--The Tribe and Great Northern Properties must agree on a revenue-sharing formula for coal produced from Federal tracts before mineral conveyances can be completed. \n(c) Completion of Mineral Conveyances.--After meeting the condition in (b), mineral conveyances under section 4(a) must be completed within 90 days. \n(d) Rescission of Mineral Conveyances.--Provisions for rescinding mineral conveyances are outlined. If any portion of the mineral conveyances under section 4(a) is invalidated by a Federal district court and not reversed on appeal, the Secretary or Great Northern Properties may rescind each mineral conveyance. This rescission would result in the waiver of the Tribe under subsection (a) being considered rescinded. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits under this Act shall reduce or deny Federal services to the Tribe or its members based on their federally recognized status. \n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations necessary to carry out this Act are authorized."
