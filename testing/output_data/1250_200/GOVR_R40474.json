    "content": "This report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act of 1976, the proposed Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District, such as Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. The report analyzes differences between the House Voting Rights Act of 2009 and previous congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia. It discusses the impact of the proposals on DC firearms laws following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The District's Firearms Control Regulation Act had provisions that barred handgun registration, prohibited carrying a pistol without a license, and required firearms to be kept unloaded or secured. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller did not address the license to carry requirement. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling, but faced criticism for its temporary amendments to the gun laws. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation in response to the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress but did not become law. Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160 in the 111th Congress, which was approved and became Title II of S. 160. The Senate approved an amendment to S. 160, which became Title II of the bill. The House passed H.R. 6842, while the DC Council enacted emergency legislation until permanent laws were in place. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed, adding restrictions on firearms regulation. These amendments were challenged but upheld in court. The District's new firearms amendments were challenged and upheld in court. Recent congressional legislation seeks to overturn or loosen DC's gun provisions, taking into consideration the FCAA and IPAA. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards for regulations, allowing states and territories to supplement them. Federal firearms laws in the United States establish minimum standards, with states and territories able to add more restrictive laws. The District of Columbia can create its own laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms. This power has been used to amend laws passed by Congress. The District of Columbia can create its own laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The question of whether the District can amend or repeal a congressional enactment depends on Congress's intent. The District of Columbia's legislative authority can be limited by congressional acts, such as H.R. 645 and Title II-S. 160, which restrict the District from enacting laws that discourage private firearm ownership. This includes provisions for acquiring, possessing, transporting, and using firearms for lawful purposes. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council in the District of Columbia would not have the authority to create laws related to firearms regulation beyond current federal laws. It aims to prevent the District from imposing restrictions on firearms possession beyond what is already prohibited or regulated at the federal level. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District of Columbia's ability to create stricter firearms laws beyond federal regulations. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private gun ownership. The District's authority to enforce sanctions for firearm misuse would also be restricted. Additionally, the language allows the District to regulate carrying firearms but not explicitly prohibit it. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District of Columbia's ability to create stricter firearms laws beyond federal regulations. It allows the District to regulate carrying firearms but not explicitly prohibit it. The District could argue for a complete prohibition on carrying firearms, but there is debate on whether this is within their authority. The definition of \"machine gun\" in the DC Code prior to Heller included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. Under the old definition in the DC Code, a \"machine gun\" was any firearm capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically without manual reloading. The FCAA amended the District's definition to align with federal law, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, the District also prohibits certain firearms based on a list similar to California's laws. The District of Columbia has aligned its definition of \"machine gun\" with federal law, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. However, certain firearms are still prohibited based on a list similar to California's laws. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, continuing to conform with the federal definition. This change would undo any alterations made by the FCAA, which currently allows for the registration of pistols for self-defense. The FCAA includes exemptions from firearm registration for temporary possession in another's home for self-defense. Amendments to qualification requirements prohibit registration for those with recent violent behavior or certain convictions. The FCAA prohibits individuals with certain legal restrictions from registering a firearm, requires completion of a firearms training course, limits the number of pistols that can be registered per person, and mandates ballistics identification for registered pistols. The registration system also serves as a licensing and permit system for firearm owners. H.R. 645 would repeal registration requirements for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. This would also remove restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. Amendments would be made to DC Code \u00a7 [phone number scrubbed].02 regarding sales and transfers of ammunition and firearms. H.R. 645 proposes changes to DC law regarding the sale and transfer of ammunition and firearms. It would allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the requirement for dealers to track ammunition inventory. The bill also addresses interstate purchase of firearms, allowing federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to residents of those states. H.R. 645 proposes amending DC law to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to District residents, with compliance required for legal conditions in both jurisdictions. The bill also addresses the storage of firearms, noting that federal law does not specify storage requirements. The District's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, now mandates that any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. The FCAA prohibits storing loaded firearms where minors can access them without permission, requiring secure storage or carrying the firearm on one's person. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors, with penalties for negligent storage. H.R. 645 proposes fines and imprisonment for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors, with penalties for negligent storage. Violators could face a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year, with exceptions such as secure storage in locked containers or on the person's body, self-defense situations, or supervised hunting/target shooting by an adult. No prosecution if the victim is the violator's child unless gross negligence is involved. Under DC law, violations of the registration scheme for firearms can result in fines or imprisonment. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision, removing criminal penalties for possession of unregistered firearms. Additionally, Title II- S. 160 would eliminate penalties for selling firearms to minors. The District also updated definitions for firearms, including \"machine gun\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws, including definitions like \"machine gun\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" H.R. 645 aims to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. It allows property owners to restrict firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws to allow property owners to restrict firearms on their premises. Private landlords can no longer restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their property. The District also has the authority to prohibit firearms on public property with security measures in place. The proposed language aims to regulate the possession of firearms in buildings or structures under the District's control, with uncertainty on whether it extends to all real property. It also raises questions about the scope of authority over lessees and the requirement of security measures in regulated areas. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, but H.R. 645 would restore this discretion. It also prohibits carrying rifles or shotguns in DC, except as permitted by law. Additionally, there are regulations on law enforcement officers carrying concealed firearms, with states able to impose their own laws on carrying. Congress passed a provision regulating law enforcement officers' ability to carry concealed firearms. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. The District currently allows firearm registration holders to carry within their home, for recreational purposes, at their place of business, or while being transported for lawful purposes. H.R. 645 would modify the provision to allow carrying firearms without a license in certain places for specific purposes. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in specific circumstances, including in their dwelling house, on land owned by them or another, for recreational purposes, and while being transported for lawful reasons. The bill would also restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses. The bill H.R. 645 allows individuals to carry firearms without a license in certain situations, such as in their home or while being transported lawfully. It includes technical changes to the District Code regarding toy and antique pistols, and grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. The bill H.R. 645 grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings over firearm registration certificate denials or revocations. However, since the registration scheme would be repealed under H.R. 645, it may be unnecessary to give the office such jurisdiction. Provisions in the DC Code related to dealer licenses and firearm transfers would no longer exist under the proposed repeal of the FCAA and IPAA. The bill H.R. 645 would repeal the District's firearm registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited by federal or District law to apply for a dealer's license, sell or transfer ammunition or firearms to a licensed dealer, or make purchases from a licensed dealer. Duties such as reporting loss, theft, or destruction of firearms or ammunition in a dealer's inventory would also be repealed. The federal Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing, shipping, or receiving firearms. The bill H.R. 645 would repeal the District's firearm registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited by federal or District law to apply for a dealer's license, sell or transfer ammunition or firearms to a licensed dealer, or make purchases from a licensed dealer. Duties such as reporting loss, theft, or destruction of firearms or ammunition in a dealer's inventory would also be repealed. The federal Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing, shipping, or receiving firearms, including those with mental health issues, criminal records, or immigration violations. Under H.R. 645, a dealer transferring firearms must meet federal requirements and additional eligibility criteria under the FCAA. Private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer. The bill removes registration requirements under DC law, relying solely on federal disqualifications for transfers. The FCAA's assault weapons ban is impacted by H.R. 645, defining specific firearms as assault weapons. The definition of \"assault weapon\" under the FCAA includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols, as well as semiautomatic firearms with military-type characteristics. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. Antique firearms and certain pistols for Olympic target shooting are excluded. Manufacturers, importers, and dealers of designated assault weapons can be held liable for damages resulting from bodily injury or death. The FCAA defines assault weapons and holds manufacturers, importers, and dealers liable for damages from bodily injury or death. It prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC, except for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. Residents can register semiautomatic firearms but are restricted from possessing such devices. This provision would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are prohibited from transferring firearms without a background check. Non-licensed persons are not required to perform a background check under federal law. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for pistol transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days. The IPAA has extended the waiting period for firearm transfers to 10 days, applying to all firearms, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA added provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols starting January 1, 2011. The FCAA now requires that no licensee can sell a semiautomatic pistol manufactured after January 1, 2011, without microstamp-ready features. New sections 503 and 504 outline the requirements for microstamp-ready pistols and prohibit the sale or possession of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009. The FCAA requires licensed dealers to sell only semiautomatic pistols with microstamp-ready features. Residents of DC can only sell pistols not on the California Roster through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the roster annually for updates. The IPAA prohibits firearm discharge without a permit and allows the District to restrict firearm possession on its property."
