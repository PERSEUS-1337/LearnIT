    "content": "The \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds that enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The increase in student enrollment will continue for the next decade, with more than 3 million additional students expected. This growth will impact high poverty urban and rural areas, as well as states with rapid population growth. To keep up with the growing number of students, schools will need to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade. Data and research from Project STAR show that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades, maintain an academic edge even after returning to normal-sized classrooms, and that adding students diminishes learning for the rest of the class. It is crucial to adequately educate children for the future and improve the learning environment without increasing the federal deficit. Congress must fund teacher positions to keep pace with increasing student enrollment. Congress needs to provide resources to keep pace with growing enrollment and reduce classroom sizes without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. The grant program is established to provide resources for growing enrollment and reducing classroom sizes without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to receive the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund to hire new teachers within 2 years of receiving funds. The agency receiving funds must hire new teachers or qualified personnel within 2 years. They must use specified accounting practices, achieve a net gain in teachers, review personnel performance annually, and limit employment to one year. Any unspent funds must be repaid to the State within 27 months. The funds can only supplement non-Federal sources for education. The agency receiving funds must apply to the Governor annually to receive funding under this Act. The funds should supplement non-Federal sources for education, not supplant them. SEC. 4. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. Each State receives funds based on the number of children aged 5-17. Unused funds are reallocated to other States. SEC. 5. FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. The agency must apply annually for funding and use it to supplement, not replace, non-Federal sources for education. SEC. 5. FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. A Governor can withhold payments to a local educational agency for noncompliance with section 3(c) after 60 days notice. The agency must increase teachers or personnel to continue receiving funds. SEC. 6. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. A Governor receiving a grant under this Act must select local educational agencies to alleviate overcrowded classes. They must evaluate and report on the funds used by the agencies annually. Up to 2% of the funds can be used for administrative costs, and up to 10% can be used to establish innovative teaching programs within the State. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with Governors, must report annually on the effectiveness of programs assisted under the Act and provide recommendations for program continuity. SEC. 7.
