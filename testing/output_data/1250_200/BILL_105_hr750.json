It also outlines conditions under which the U.S. President could adjust the application of laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Congress finds that the Joint Declaration between the UK and China on Hong Kong's reversion in 1997 is a binding agreement ensuring Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights. China has pledged a high degree of autonomy and democratic elections for Hong Kong. Despite China's assurances for a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty and the implementation of the \"one country, two systems\" policy, there are concerns about potential infringements on Hong Kong's autonomy. This includes attempts to obtain confidential files on civil servants and dissolve democratic processes. The curr_chunk discusses the loyalty oaths required of servants, the dissolution of the democratically elected Legislative Council by China, restrictions on speech and association post-reversion, warnings to religious institutions, and the repeal/amendment of Hong Kong ordinances. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 addresses the reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 and aims to protect US interests and the human rights of the Hong Kong people.

The United States calls on China to honor its treaty obligations regarding Hong Kong's legislature and civil rights, warning that repealing certain ordinances threatens the people's freedom of association and speech. The US also urges the National People's Congress to reconsider its decision to amend these rights. The United States urges China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and civil rights, emphasizing the importance of public consultation for new legislation that aligns with international human rights standards. The Government of China is urged to respect the autonomy and independence of Hong Kong's chief executive, civil service, judiciary, police, and Independent Commission Against Corruption. SEC. 5.
