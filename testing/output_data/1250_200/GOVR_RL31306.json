Members questioned proposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and workforce restructuring. The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee held hearings on the FY2003 budget for Interior and related agencies. Topics included conservation initiatives, Indian trust funds, National Park Service maintenance backlog, Everglades restoration, and energy programs. Discussions also covered proposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and workforce restructuring. The Subcommittee marked up its funding recommendations in June and the House passed H.R. 5093 in July, which was then sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee held a hearing on the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. Interior Secretary Norton testified, emphasizing the Administration's request for funds for enhanced security measures. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up and ordered reported its funding recommendations, but the Senate did not pass an Interior funding bill in the 107th Congress due to controversies over wildfires. Controversies over funding and management of wildfires led to a protracted debate in the 107th Congress. Senate debates included amendments for firefighting costs and forest thinning, with unresolved issues. Other contentious topics included farm disaster relief, federal recognition of Indian tribes, stewardship contracting, wilderness in Tongass National Forest, development in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and grazing permits. The Senate passed the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY2003 on January 23rd, 2003, which included funding for Interior and related agencies. The bill addressed various considerations such as stewardship contracting, wilderness in the Tongass National Forest, development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, renewal of grazing permits, Missouri River flows, Everglades restoration, funding for land acquisition and conservation, development of oil and gas leases off the California coast, and management of Indian tribes' trust funds and assets.

The Senate omnibus bill for FY2003 allocated $19.80 billion, with additional cuts and increases resulting in a total reduction estimated at 2.852%. The House bill had a higher total amount of $20.41 billion for FY2003, including funding for conservation spending. The House bill for FY2003 provides higher funding for wildland fire fighting and various agencies compared to the Senate and Administration. Conferees were appointed for H.J.Res. 2, leading to the agreement on the Consolidated Appropriations resolution for FY2003 on February 13, 2003. The Consolidated Appropriations resolution for FY2003, signed into law as P.L. 108-7 by President George Bush on February 20, 2003, provided $19.08 billion for the Interior and related agencies plus $825.0 million for fire fighting. A 0.65% cut was applied proportionately to each account and program. Interior and related agencies appropriations increased by 42% from FY1994 to FY2003. During the ten-year period from FY1994 to FY2003, Interior and related agencies appropriations increased by 42% in current dollars, reaching $19.1 billion. The growth was most significant in the latter years, with a 33% increase from FY1999 to FY2003. The largest increase occurred from FY2000 to FY2001, with a 27% rise in funding. Much of the additional funding was allocated to land management agencies for conservation and fire management. Regular appropriations for combating terrorism in FY2001 and FY2002 were not clearly specified in the Interior appropriations laws. Funding for anti-terrorism efforts was typically included in larger line items or program requests. For example, the Bureau of Land Management received $3.0 million in FY2002 to assess oil and gas resources on public lands in response to potential disruptions to America's energy supply from terrorist attacks. Additionally, a $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation for FY2001 was enacted by Congress in three phases following the September 11th attacks, with funds being made available immediately and in subsequent phases after notification to Congress. Following the September 11th attacks, Congress enacted a $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation for FY2001 in three phases. The final $20 billion required allocation in another emergency appropriations act. The Department of Interior and related agencies received $3.1 million for emergency response costs in New York City and Washington, D.C.

President Bush rejected $5.1 billion in contingent emergency spending, stating that some of the funds were not related to a national emergency. He later requested $1 billion for selected programs in a separate supplemental request. This request did not include funds for DOI and related agencies. The Administration sought $37.7 billion for homeland security in FY2003, with $25.2 billion as discretionary budget authority for non-Department of Defense operations. In FY2003, the Administration requested $37.7 billion for homeland security, with $25.2 billion for non-Department of Defense operations.

In FY2003, Congress enacted $109.1 million for the energy and minerals program, a $9.6 million increase over FY2002. The additional funds were requested by the Administration to increase oil and gas availability on federal lands, including Alaska North Slope development. The Interior appropriations bill added funds for permitting and rights of way, including the renewal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline right of way. The FY2003 law included provisions for the renewal of the right of way across federal lands for the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program. It also prohibited funds from being used for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except as allowed by presidential proclamations. The FY2003 law included provisions for the renewal of the right of way across federal lands for the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program. It also prohibited funds from being used for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except as allowed by presidential proclamations. The House Committee on Appropriations agreed to report language on the energy and minerals program, stating no funds were included for potential energy development within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act currently prohibits oil and gas production on ANWR lands without congressional authorization. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not contain this prohibition. Conferees on the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill included language in the joint explanatory. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill included language potentially allowing funds for preliminary work in ANWR, despite the prohibition in ANILCA. Grazing permits and leases were automatically renewed until the renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill included language allowing funds for preliminary work in ANWR, despite the prohibition in ANILCA. Expiring permits or leases would continue under the new permit or lease until the renewal process is completed, with a focus on addressing heavy agency workloads in processing grazing permits and leases. $47.6 million was allocated for land use planning in FY2003, a 44% increase from the previous year, to initiate new plans and update existing ones to reflect current conditions and issues. The Administration's priority is to address issues including increased energy development, enhanced protection from wildfire, and resolution of resource conflicts by updating land use plans. Additional funds are part of a multi-year effort to update plans, with about half currently out of date. Wildland fire management funds for FY2003 were reduced from the previous year, with a focus on reducing hazardous fuels as part of the National Fire Plan. The FY2003 law allocates funds for various programs including hazardous fuels management, PILT, and land acquisition. The Senate report requires 70% of hazardous fuels funds to be used in the wildland urban interface. PILT receives $220.0 million, an increase from FY2002. Land Acquisition sees a reduction to $33.5 million for 18 projects in 8 states, a 33% decrease from FY2002. The FY2003 law allocates funds for various programs including hazardous fuels management, PILT, and land acquisition. The Bureau of Land Management seeks to emphasize alternatives to fee title land purchases, such as land exchanges and purchase of conservation easements and development rights. The appropriations for BLM in FY2002 were higher than the approved amount of $30.2 million from the Senate. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated funds for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), with the Senate passing $1.21 billion and the House passing $1.40 billion. The final law provided $1.25 billion in annual appropriations, with the largest portion going to the Resources Management account. The Senate's bill included $902.7 million for FY2003, slightly lower than the Administration's budget. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $917.4 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service, with $132.6 million allocated for the Endangered Species program. Funding for related conservation programs also saw changes, with the Landowner Incentive Program receiving $81.0 million. The President's proposal for FY2003 includes a decrease in funding for Endangered Species programs, with grants to states and territories decreasing from $96.2 million to $91.0 million. The Landowner Incentive Program would increase to $50 million, while Stewardship Grants would remain at $10 million. The FY2003 enacted funding for Endangered Species programs would decrease by $58.4 million compared to FY2002. The FY2003 law expresses Congress's sense for parties in a dispute over Missouri River management to reach agreement on a flow schedule in 2003. Two Corps of Engineers proposals would benefit the barge industry but harm listed species. Environmental groups intend to sue over past harm to listed species. The FY2003 law includes provisions for increased funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System, with proposed increases ranging from 13.1% to 17.7%. The President proposed a 7.6% increase for operations and maintenance, but the enacted bill provided a 25.8% increase. Additionally, there are plans to celebrate the centennial of the first National Wildlife Refuge on Pelican Island in Florida. The FY2003 appropriations law provided a 25.8% increase in funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System, with a recommended $52.0 million for infrastructure improvements. The law also included provisions for energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska, with a proposed increase in management allocation. The conference committee did not change the House allocation but removed a restriction within the BLM.

The law also addressed energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The conference committee did not change the House allocation but removed a restriction within the BLM budget. Additionally, the FY2003 Budget Justification highlighted the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on FWS law enforcement, leading to increased security measures at refuge facilities. Refuge officers were also deployed on temporary assignments to support national security efforts. The National Wildlife Refuge System received increased funding for infrastructure improvements in FY2003, with $52.0 million allocated. The President proposed $49.9 million for Law Enforcement, plus $2.0 million for infrastructure improvement, with a total of $51.9 million provided in the appropriations law.

Congress rejected the proposed transfer and appropriated $3.0 million for the Migratory Bird program, increasing funding for all subprograms. The National Park Service (NPS) manages a diverse park system covering 84 million acres with various designations. They protect natural and historic areas, provide funding support to national heritage areas, and had 276 million visitors in 2002. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $2.25 billion to the NPS. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $2.25 billion for the National Park Service, a decrease of $134.8 million from FY2002. The President aims to eliminate the maintenance backlog, improve security, and involve more partnership groups in park support. The Senate approved $2.29 billion, while the House approved $2.40 billion for the NPS operations. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $2.25 billion for the National Park Service, a decrease from the previous year. The Senate supported efforts to increase funding for NPS operations and eliminate deferred maintenance backlog by FY2007, but the proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative was rejected. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $2.25 billion for the National Park Service, with the Senate rejecting the proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative due to existing unmet needs. The House supported conservation partnerships but did not specify funding for the CCI. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but $5 million was retained for the NPS Challenge Cost Share Program in FY2003. The construction line item received $327.8 million, slightly above the President's request but below the FY2002 appropriation. The FY2003 law provided $522.8 million for facility operation and maintenance, $16.2 million below FY2002 appropriations. The estimated deferred maintenance for the NPS is $4.1 billion to $6.8 billion. President Bush aimed to eliminate NPS deferred maintenance within five years through new appropriations, transportation fund money, and recreation fees. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for the U.S. Park Police, with an increase from FY2002 but a decrease from the total FY2002 appropriation. Additionally, the budget emphasized anti-terrorism protection at national icon sites. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for park recreation and resource protection programs, with a decrease in funding compared to FY2002. The budget also included provisions for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program, which was not requested by the Administration except for the administration of previously awarded grants. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for park recreation and resource protection programs, including $30.0 million for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. Congress provided $172.5 million for NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance, a reduction from previous years. The federal program acquires lands for the National Park System, while the state assistance program aids in park land acquisition for states. The Administration requested $86.1 million for federal land acquisition and $200 million for LWCF state assistance. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for park recreation and resource protection programs, including $30.0 million for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. Congress provided $172.5 million for NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance, a reduction from previous years. The Administration requested $86.1 million for federal land acquisition and $200 million for LWCF state assistance. The Administration's request for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance was $200 million, including $50 million for grants under its proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative and $150 million for the traditional LWCF state grants program. Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (Fee Demo) allows federal land management agencies to retain and spend receipts from entrance and user fees for projects at collecting sites, with a portion distributed to other agency sites. The NPS estimates Fee Demo receipts of $149.0 million for FY2003, with at least half to be used for deferred maintenance. The Administration's FY2003 budget stated an intent to propose legislation to make the program permanent and remove it from the appropriations process. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for park programs, including the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. Congress provided funds for NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance. The Administration proposed legislation to make the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program permanent. Everglades Restoration is in early stages, with controversy over the Modified Water Delivery Project seeking to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park. The FY2003 law authorizes the U.S Army Corps of Engineers to implement a flood protection plan for the \"8.5 Square Mile Area\" as part of the Modified Waters Delivery Project. The Corps can acquire land from unwilling sellers through condemnation authority, with conditions including offering comparable property with flood protection and providing financial assistance for acquisitions. The Corps and non-federal sponsors may use funds from the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 and DOI for land acquisition in the 8.5 SMA. Failure to acquire this land would hinder the Modified Water Delivery Project and parts of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Authorization for the Alternative 6D Plan has faced controversy in Congress, with a provision being removed from the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. The implementation of Alternative 6D was removed from the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill due to points of order. The Senate later passed an omnibus appropriations bill that included an amendment authorizing the Corps to implement flood protection under Alternative 6D for the 8.5 SMA. For more information on the Modified Water Delivery Project and funding for Everglades restoration, refer to CRS Report RS21331. The Historic Preservation fund provides grants for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. The Historic Preservation Fund provides funding for cultural heritage projects for various groups, including Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Grants are typically funded on a 60% federal- 40% state matching share basis. The FY2003 budget allocated $69.0 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, with grants-in-aid to states and territories at $34.0 million. This was an increase from the previous year but a decrease from the FY2002 appropriation.

This is an increase from the previous year but a decrease from the FY2002 appropriation. Save America's Treasures grants are given to preserve nationally significant artifacts and historic structures. The program has funded projects like the restoration of the Star Spangled Banner and properties such as the Rosa Parks Museum and the Mark Twain House. The Save America's Treasures program, funded in FY2001 and FY2002, was criticized for lack of geographic diversity. Projects now require formal approval by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Each project needs a 50% cost share and cannot receive more than one grant. The FY2003 appropriations level for the program is $30.0 million. In the past, funds have been allocated for preservation projects on Historically Black Colleges and Universities campuses. Grants were awarded for repairs on HBCU buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Funding for HBCUs under HPF was eliminated in FY2003 due to expended authorized funding. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, chartered in 1949, no longer receives permanent federal funding but maintains financial assistance programs. In FY2002, $2.5 million was allocated to the National Trust for the Historic Sites Fund, matched with non-federal funds, for the care of endangered historic places. The FY2003 budget proposed eliminating this grant, but the final appropriation provided $2.0 million for the endowment. The Preservation Fund received $2.5 million in FY2002 for historic sites care, with a proposed elimination in the FY2003 budget. However, $2.0 million was ultimately provided for the endowment. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the primary science agency for earth and biological sciences, natural hazards, and water resources, receiving $925.3 million in FY2003. The USGS received $925.3 million in FY2003, $11.3 million over FY2002, and $58.0 million over the FY2003 request. The National Mapping Program was allocated $134.1 million, $4.8 million above the Administration's request.

The House approved $91.2 million for Facilities, while the Senate passed $89.4 million. The conference managers emphasized support for USGS partnerships. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers two programs: the Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) Program and the Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Program. OMM oversees leasing and production of offshore oil, gas, and minerals, while MRM collects and disburses revenues from federal leases. In FY2003, MMS anticipated collecting $4.2 billion in revenues from federal leases, with funds distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $171.4 million for MMS, including $6.1 million for oil spill research. In FY2003, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) received a total appropriation of $171.4 million, including $6.1 million for oil spill research. The budget for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management was $265.5 million, with $165.3 million from appropriations and $100.2 million from offsetting collections. The Senate supported $270.7 million for MMS, while the House approved $271.1 million, both including funding for OMM and MRM programs. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) received $137.6 million for OMM and $83.3 million for MRM programs, with $100.2 million from offsetting collections. The MMS revised its mineral leasing revenue estimates downward by 40% in FY2003 due to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas. Royalties from natural gas production have accounted for 40%-45% of MMS receipts over the past decade. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a 5-year leasing program for oil and gas sales. The new 5-year program (2002-2007) includes 20 lease sales, with controversy surrounding sales in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. The FY2003 appropriations law continues the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico outside Lease Sale 181. Additionally, a breach-of-contract lawsuit involving MMS and nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion drew congressional interest. A breach-of-contract lawsuit involving MMS and nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for undeveloped leases in offshore California drew congressional interest. The companies claim MMS failed to conduct consistency determinations required by the court. The Ninth Circuit Court struck down MMS lease suspensions in 2001 for not being consistent with California's coastal zone management plan. The Bush Administration appealed the decision but the Court upheld its ruling. The Bush Administration appealed a decision favoring California regarding offshore oil leases. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision, giving the Department of the Interior 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. Legislation was passed to prohibit funding for exploration and development of the contested leases. The Senate approved a sense of the Senate amendment in January 2003 to compensate companies for surrendering undeveloped leases off California's coast. Legislation sought to provide financial credits for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The Administration announced plans to buy back oil and gas leases from certain companies in Florida.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to oversee coal mining land reclamation. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to ensure coal-mined land is restored. It also created an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund for reclaiming hazardous sites. OSM oversees state regulatory programs, with some states lacking approved programs. The FY2003 budget for OSM saw a decrease in funds, with the Senate-passed total of $297.1 million enacted. The budget has two components: Regulation and... The House approved $290.1 million, and the Senate passed $297.1 million for the FY2003 OSM budget. The budget has two components: Regulation and Technology programs and Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund. The Administration sought $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology, including funding for ACSI and SOAP. For the AML Fund, the Administration sought $174.0 million, but Congress enacted $191.7 million for FY2003. The House, Senate, and Administration supported $191.7 million for AML in FY2003. The House approved $184.7 million for AML, $10.7 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate recommended $191.7 million, restoring cuts for State and Tribal AML grants. The omnibus appropriations legislation adopted the Senate's recommendation. Grants to states are based on coal production levels. The AML appropriations for FY2003 were supported by the House, Senate, and Administration, with grants to states based on coal production levels. Minimum program states with significant AML problems but low coal production levels have faced funding challenges, with Congress appropriating $1.5 million since FY1996. The unappropriated balance of AML collections is expected to reach $1.65 billion by the end of FY2003.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to federally recognized tribes and historically leads federal dealings with tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the lead agency in federal dealings with Indian and Alaska Native tribes, providing programs such as government operations, education, and economic development. In FY2003, the BIA received $2.27 billion in appropriations, a 2.7% increase from FY2002. The Administration requested a $34.8 million increase for trust management improvement. The Administration requested a $34.8 million increase for trust management improvement in selected BIA programs. The Senate approved the full amount, but the appropriations law reduced it to $31.9 million. Additional funding was proposed for the Branch of Acknowledgment and Research for tribal recognition, with the House enacting $1.6 million. A provision for a study commission on Native American policy was dropped by the House. The FY2003 Interior bill was discussed in the House and Senate, with a proposed moratorium on BAR tribal recognition approvals being tabled. The Senate added a title to settle an Indian land claim by Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico in the Cibola National Forest. Key issues for the Bureau of Indian Affairs include reorganization, tribal influence on programs, and problems in the BIA school system. Trust funds and assets management are central to the BIA reorganization proposals. The BIA manages Indian tribes' trust funds and assets, including land resources and economic activities. Historically, there were issues with mismanagement, leading to reforms in 1994 and 1996. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians was created for oversight, and trust fund management was transferred to the OST. The BIA still manages trust assets and is working on trust management improvement projects. The current trust management improvement project includes enhancements in trust asset systems, policies, historical accounting, backlog reduction, and system maintenance. It replaces a previous plan from the Clinton Administration. A new computerized trust asset management system faced criticism, leading to a review by Electronic Data Systems, Inc. (EDS). EDS recommended a single executive for trust reform. The Secretary proposed creating a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM) to address these issues. The Secretary proposed creating a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM) to address trust management issues. However, the reprogramming request for FY2002 funds was not approved by the Appropriations Committees, leading to consultation with Indian tribes. The majority of tribes opposed the BITAM proposal, resulting in the Senate Appropriations Committee forbidding its implementation. In December 2002, a new proposed reorganization of BIA and OST trust management structures was announced. The head of the BIA announced a new proposed reorganization of BIA and OST trust management structures, aiming for greater tribal control over federal Indian programs. The plan involves splitting off the BIA's trust operations at regional and agency levels and having trust officers oversee trust management. Despite objections from tribes, the reorganization is set to proceed. In FY2002, Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) accounted for a significant portion of the BIA's budget, giving tribes more influence in budget planning. Contract support costs fund non-operational expenses for tribes administering programs under self-determination contracts. Issues include consistent shortfall in appropriations and rate-setting methods. The BIA funds 185 elementary and secondary schools, with tribes operating 121 of them. BIA schools face challenges with low student achievement and inadequate facilities. The Administration proposes a \"School Privatization Initiative\" to improve academic performance by either tribal operation or privatization by FY2007, which some tribes are skeptical about. The BIA's \"School Privatization Initiative\" aims to transition BIA-operated schools to tribal operation or privatization by FY2007. Some tribes are concerned about inadequate funding and the potential consequences of this proposal. Both Senate and House Committees opposed the initiative and removed its funding, with no allocation in the FY2003 appropriations law. BIA schools face challenges with old, dilapidated facilities and a backlog of $942 million in education facility repairs. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 to oversee Indian tribal regulation of gaming operations. Its budget authority mainly comes from annual fees assessed on tribes' Class II operations. In the 1990s, as Indian gaming expanded, Congress increased the NIGC's budget through the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act. In the 1990s, Congress increased the NIGC's budget through the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act to $8 million, including fees from Class III operations. The demand for oversight resources grew due to the rapid expansion of California Indian gaming. Funding for NIGC activities from FY1999-FY2002 came solely from fees, with a proposed $2 million appropriation for FY2003. However, Congress did not enact NIGC appropriations for FY2003 but increased the fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004. The NIGC did not receive appropriations for FY2003, but the fee ceiling was raised to $12 million for FY2004. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and funds, established after severe mismanagement under the BIA. In 1996, the Secretary of the Interior transferred trust fund management from the BIA to the OST. FY2002 funding for the Office of Special Trustee was $110.2 million, including $99.2 million for federal trust programs and $11.0 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Administration proposed a FY2003 budget of $159.0 million for the OST, with $151.0 million for federal trust programs. The Senate approved an increase to $162.0 million for the OST, including $3 million for the Indian land consolidation project. For FY2003, Congress enacted the House-approved $149.3 million budget for the Office of Special Trustee, which included $141.3 million for trust programs and $8.0 million for land consolidation. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts, totaling approximately $3.1 billion and $400 million, respectively. The funds come from various sources such as claims awards, settlements, and investment income, with ongoing controversy surrounding a class action lawsuit filed in 1996. The trust funds controversy involves a class action lawsuit filed in 1996 by IIM account holders against the federal government. The latest stage of the lawsuit relates to an historical accounting for IIM funds to determine the amount owed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs estimate they are owed about $137 billion using a different methodology. The district court held the Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in contempt for trust management reform issues. Both parties submitted plans for future trust management and historical accounting by January 6, 2003. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act to address concerns related to the IIM lawsuit, including limiting the time period for historical accounting and capping the compensation of court-appointed officials monitoring trust reform. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act to address concerns related to the IIM lawsuit, including limiting the time period for historical accounting and capping the compensation of court-appointed officials monitoring trust reform. The Senate did not agree to these provisions, but the FY2003 appropriations law included them. The Office of Insular Affairs provides financial assistance to territories and former insular areas, managing relations with the federal government and building local government capacity. Funding for the OIA consists of permanent appropriations and discretionary funding. The combined funding for the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) for FY2002 was $353.0 million, with a reduction to $343.5 million for FY2003. The Senate approved $348.5 million, while the House approved $346.7 million. The approved funding level for FY2003 is $349.6 million, with permanent and indefinite appropriations historically making up 70% to 80% of the OIA budget. This includes payments to freely associated states and fiscal assistance to U.S. territories. Discretionary and current mandatory funds make up the remaining balance of the OIA budget. The FY2003 OIA budget includes discretionary funding of $97.2 million, with $76.2 million for Assistance to Territories and $21.0 million for Compact of Free Association assistance. Congress monitors economic development in insular areas. For more information, visit the OIA website at http://www.doi.gov/oia/index.html. The Forest Service budget for FY2003 is $3.98 billion, $153.7 million less than FY2002. Fire funding and protection programs were a major issue in the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. The Senate did not pass the bill due to disputes over fire funding and wildfire protection programs. Funding levels and locations for fire protection treatments were debated, including thinning and prescribed burning. The discussion in FY2003 includes questions about funding levels and locations for fire protection treatments like thinning, prescribed burning, and clearing around structures. There is debate on whether logging and access roads help or worsen fire control. The National Fire Plan was introduced after severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002, with $1.8 billion allocated for BLM and Forest Service lands. Congress debated on funding for wildfire protection programs. The National FirePlan, comprising the Forest Service wildland fire program and fire fighting on DOI lands, received appropriations totaling $2.89 billion for FY2001. Funding for the FY2002 National Fire Plan was $2.24 billion, with decreases in fire suppression operations due to a less severe fire season. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for the National Fire Plan was $2.03 billion, $204 million less than the previous year. Funding levels and locations for fire protection treatments were debated, including the effectiveness of logging and access roads in fire control. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for wildland fire management was $2.03 billion, $204 million less than the previous year. The funding included $160.4 million for BLM fire suppression and $420.7 million for FS fire suppression, with slight decreases from FY2002 levels. The appropriation also matched the President's request for fire preparedness funding. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for wildland fire management was $2.03 billion, with slight reductions in funding for BLM and FS fire suppression compared to FY2002 levels. The appropriation matched the President's request for fire preparedness funding, with adjustments made to various BLM and FS fire operations budgets. The 2002 fire season was severe, with wildfires burning 7,112,733 acres by November 15, 2002. In FY2003, wildfires burned 7,112,733 acres, almost as much as in 2000, the most severe fire season since the 1950s. The FS and BLM used FY2002 suppression funding and borrowed from other accounts. Congress debated whether to include supplemental funds in the FY2003 appropriation to repay funds borrowed for firefighting. Ultimately, $825 million was enacted to repay the borrowed funds for FY2002 firefighting. The House added $700 million in FY2002 funds to the FY2003 Interior Appropriations bill for fire suppression. The Administration requested $825 million to supplement the FY2002 firefighting efforts. Sen. Byrd offered an amendment to add the Administration's request to the Interior bill during Senate consideration of H.R. 5093. The Senate debated amendments to add supplemental funds for firefighting efforts in FY2002, but no resolution was reached due to disagreements on wildland fire funding. The Senate discontinued debate on the Interior appropriations bill in the 107th Congress, with pending amendments from Sen. Byrd and Sen. Craig/Sen. Domenici. The House Resources Committee considered related authorizing legislation, but none was enacted in the 107th Congress. The FY2003 appropriations law extended stewardship authorization through 2013 for BLM and an unlimited number of FS contracts. This allows agencies to require fuel reduction or other stewardship activities as part of timber sale contracts. Supporters claim it is an efficient way to achieve non-commercial benefits, while opponents argue it may incentivize more tree cutting. Congress also examined other Forest Service programs for FY2003 funding levels, including the proposed termination of the Economic Action Program and Pacific Northwest economic assistance. The FY2003 appropriations law included $31.4 million for the Economic Action Program, a $26.2 million decrease from FY2002. Land acquisition was cut by $15.9 million to $133.8 million, and Infrastructure Improvement was reduced by $10.1 million to $45.9 million. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced funding for the Forest Stewardship Program by $16.4 million (49%) to $32.2 million, a $1.0 million (3%) decrease from FY2002. Additionally, the law did not include funding for the new Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund or Expedited Consultations as proposed in the budget request. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced funding for the Forest Stewardship Program by $16.4 million to $32.2 million, a $1.0 million decrease from FY2002. The Forest Legacy Program saw an increase to $69.8 million, with the House reducing it to $60.0 million and the Senate increasing it to $74.0 million. The law also contained legislative language on the Tongass National Forest, prohibiting appeals and review of a specific decision, essentially approving no additional wilderness in the forest. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced funding for the Forest Stewardship Program and increased funding for the Forest Legacy Program. It also included legislative language on the Tongass National Forest, essentially approving no additional wilderness in the forest. For more information on the U.S. Forest Service, visit their website. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $624.9 million for Fossil Energy R&D, a 7% increase from FY2002 and a 28% increase from the President's FY2003 request. The funding difference is mainly in fuel cells, transportation fuels, natural gas, and petroleum production technologies. The Senate approved $625.7 million, while the House approved $664.2 million for fossil energy programs. $150.0 million was provided for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) and approved Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) deferrals of $87 million. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $150.0 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) and approved Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) deferrals of $87 million. The program aims to fund advanced research and development for coal-fired power generators, with a $2 billion ten-year commitment. The Administration had requested $150.0 million for CCPI for FY2003, but had not recommended a deferral from previously appropriated Clean Coal Technology Program funds. The Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) has been funded separately from other fossil R&D programs. The Administration proposed consolidating it with coal R&D programs but it was retained as a separate program in the FY2003 appropriations law. The Senate and House supported funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) but deferred funding for CCTP. The Administration's request included cuts to natural gas and petroleum R&D funding, which the Senate supported at higher levels. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $22.6 million for natural gas and $35.4 million for petroleum R&D, while the Senate and House supported higher funding levels. The Fuels program faced funding cuts in the Administration's request, but the Senate and House approved higher amounts. The Energy Technology Center received $68.9 million, exceeding the Administration's request, and $40.2 million was allocated for sequestration R&D. The FY2003 law allocated $40.2 million for sequestration R&D, an increase from FY2002. The Administration proposed transferring the FE Infrastructure program to reduce duplication, but the Senate and House supported keeping it within Fossil Energy. The Clean Coal Technology Program and Strategic Petroleum Reserve were also discussed. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in late 1975 to store over 570 million barrels of crude oil in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. Calls for drawdowns from the SPR arose due to oil price increases in 1999. The Clinton Administration authorized exchanges and swaps of oil from the SPR, as well as accepting roughly 28 million barrels as royalty-in-kind payments. President Bush ordered the SPR to be filled to capacity in 2001 using royalty-in-kind oil. In mid-November 2001, President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to capacity with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. The FY2003 appropriation law allocated $180.9 million for the SPR, with $172.9 million for facilities and operations, $2 million for transportation of RIK oil, and $6 million for leasing storage facilities. The FY2003 budget request for the SPR was $187.7 million, an increase of $8.7 million from the previous year. The FY2003 budget allocated $180.9 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with $172.9 million for facilities and operations, $2 million for transportation of RIK oil, and $6 million for leasing storage facilities. The Senate recommended $189.9 million, with $158.9 for facilities, $16 million for management, $7 million for RIK oil transportation, and $8 million for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. The House approved $190.9 million, including an additional $1 million for management. The omnibus appropriations legislation approved $172.9 million for the SPR, $7 million for the SPR Petroleum Account, and $6 million for the NHOR. The Senate approved $185.9 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the omnibus appropriations legislation, with permanent authorization and a directive to fill it to capacity. Additionally, the Naval Petroleum Reserves were transferred to the Department of the Interior. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program was transferred to the Department of the Interior, with only two small oil fields remaining in California and Wyoming. These fields are expected to generate around $7.2 million in revenue for the government in FY2003. The FY2003 budget for the Naval Petroleum Reserves was $20.8 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from the previous year. The final appropriation for FY2003 was $17.8 million, a $3 million reduction from the approved levels. In FY2003, the Naval Petroleum Reserves program was transferred to the Department of the Interior, with only two small oil fields remaining in California and Wyoming. The program generated $7.2 million in revenue for the government. The budget for FY2003 was $20.8 million, with a final appropriation of $17.8 million, a reduction from the approved levels. Additionally, California's dispute with the federal government over Elk Hills resulted in the California Teachers' Retirement Fund receiving 9% of the sale proceeds. The FY2003 budget included an advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund. The Energy Efficiency Program emphasized the benefits of energy efficiency programs for the nation. The FY2003 budget proposed changes in energy efficiency programs, reflecting findings of the National Energy Policy Report and the President's Management Agenda. The Department of Energy planned to decrease conservation funding under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy from $912.8 million in FY2002 to $901.6 million in FY2003. In the FY2003 budget, there were changes in energy efficiency programs, with the Department of Energy planning to decrease conservation funding. The House-approved level for the DOE Energy Conservation Program in the 107th Congress included funding for weatherization grants, state energy grants, R&D, and a general reduction. The Senate-passed bill in the 108th Congress allocated less funding compared to the House level, resulting in a lower enacted level of $897.6 million for the DOE Energy Conservation Program. The FY2003 bill includes $897.6 million for the DOE Energy Conservation Program, with cuts in various areas such as weatherization grants, R&D, and transportation R&D. Industry R&D sees a decrease, while Power Technologies and Energy Star receive increases in funding. In the 107th Congress, the House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million in new funding for program reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million in new funding for DOE to improve program success measurement through reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The FY2003 law allocates $500,000 for this purpose. The House report directs EERE to adopt procurement practices for full and open competition. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed EERE to revise budget request documents for FY2004. The conference report did not add any further provisions.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides comprehensive medical and environmental health services to 1.5 to 1.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban Indian operated programs and facilities. IHS operates 36 hospitals, 58 health centers, 4 school health centers, and 44 health stations, while tribes and tribal groups operate additional facilities under IHS contracts. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates numerous health facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and health stations, serving American Indians and Alaska Natives. Funding for IHS is divided into services and facilities categories, with appropriations for FY2003 totaling $2.868 billion, primarily allocated to health services. This funding is sourced from congressional appropriations, private health insurance reimbursements, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding from congressional appropriations, private health insurance reimbursements, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In FY2003, IHS estimates collecting $450 million in reimbursements. The service budget includes clinical services, preventive health services, and other services. Congress allocated $1.987 billion for FY2003, supporting programs for hospitals, dental health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment within clinical services. In FY2003, Congress allocated $1.987 billion for Indian Health Service programs, including hospitals, dental health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. The budget also included funding for contract health care services and preventive health services. Congress approved funding for public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and the community health representatives' program. The House, Senate, and Congress allocated funds for various health-related activities, including off-reservation urban health projects and tribal management grants. They differed in amounts for scholarships to Indian health professionals, with Congress enacting the Senate's recommendation. Additionally, the House expected the Indian Health Service to implement a program offering bonus payments to health professionals. The Senate and House allocated funds for health services, with differences in self-governance funding. Congress enacted $60.6 million for IHS operations and $5.6 million for self-governance. Contract support costs of $270.7 million were approved for tribes. The Senate did not agree with the President's proposed reductions in staffing levels, travel, training, and copying costs for direct operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the Administration's proposal to transfer and consolidate IHS's Office of Legislative Affairs into the Department of Health and Human Services. The Committee noted that the IHS office handles complex Native American and Alaskan Indian health service issues, requiring more expertise and attention than a consolidation would allow. The House did not comment on the issue. DHHS consolidations or realignments of IHS programs must be approved by both Appropriations Committees. The House recommended $391.9 million for FY2003 for IHS facilities, a 6.1% increase over the previous year's appropriation. The House recommended a total of $391.9 million for FY2003 for the Indian Health Service, a 6.1% increase over the previous year's appropriation. The Senate provided $365.4 million, a 1.1% decrease from the FY2002 appropriation. Both bodies disagreed with using IHS funds for constructing sanitation facilities in new houses funded under HUD. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was reauthorized for FY1995-2000. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301. The 1974 relocation legislation (P.L. 93-531, as amended) resolved a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land. ONHIR's main activities include housing and land acquisition, and certifying families' eligibility for relocation benefits. Most relocatees are Navajo, with some families still in the process of acquiring replacement housing. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in housing acquisition, construction, land acquisition, and certifying families' eligibility for relocation benefits. In FY2002, ONHIR received $15.1 million in appropriations, with a proposed decrease to $14.5 million for FY2003. Negotiations and litigation have taken place among the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land, and the federal government. Settlement agreements have been reached on some issues, but opposition to these agreements and leases remains strong. The settlement agreement between the United States and the Hopi Tribe has not resolved all issues, leading to strong opposition from some Navajo families. By September 1999, 70 out of 73 Navajo families on Hopi-partitioned land had signed accommodation agreements. The FY2003 appropriations law prevents ONHIR from evicting Navajo families without providing replacement homes. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take action against the United States under certain circumstances. The settlement agreement between the United States and the Hopi Tribe allows the Tribe to take action against the US if Navajo families on Hopi-partitioned lands have not relocated or signed accommodation agreements. The Hopi Tribe has not yet filed a quiet possession claim but has agreed to wait while legal actions are pursued against non-compliant Navajo families. Congress debates the federal government's role in supporting arts and culture programs. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum complex with 16 museums, the National Zoo, and research facilities. It receives 70% of its funding from the federal government and has a total of 42 million visits in 2001. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $548.5 million for the Smithsonian, an increase from previous years. Congress is debating the federal government's role in supporting arts and culture programs. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $548.5 million for the Smithsonian, including $449.1 million for Salaries and Expenses. $16.0 million is allocated for the National Museum of the American Indian's construction. There was controversy over the need for a new museum versus renovating existing ones. The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) received private donations totaling $36.7 million, with $15 million coming directly from the Indian community. The estimated cost for the museum was $219.3 million, with $20 million in trust funds allocated for opening costs. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in 1999, with the projected opening set for 2004. The FY2003 appropriation included $83.4 million for facility repairs, including funds for the National Zoo and renovation of other Smithsonian buildings. The Smithsonian Institution received $78.3 million for critical repairs and renovations at various facilities, including the National Zoo, Patent Office Building, and National Museum of Natural History. The Institution is responsible for maintaining over 400 buildings with 8 million square feet of space. A study by the National Academy of Public Administration highlighted the lack of funding for facility maintenance, leading to increased deterioration of the physical plant. The NAPA report found that funding for repair and renewal of Smithsonian's facilities has not kept pace with the need, requiring over $1.5 billion in the next decade. The Smithsonian receives trust funds from private sources, government grants, and contracts, as well as income from business ventures like the Smithsonian magazine and retail shops. Private donor designated funds also contribute to specific projects, totaling $178.8 million in FY2001. In FY2001, private donors, foundations, and corporate sources contributed $178.8 million for designated projects at the Smithsonian. A single $60 million donation was pledged by Steven F. Udvar-Hazy for the National Air and Space Museum's Dulles Center. Government grants and contracts, separate from regular appropriations, also support Smithsonian projects, with a projected $70 million for FY2002. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan for tracking trust fund expenditures in FY2003. In FY2003, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan developed by the Smithsonian to track trust fund budget proposals and expenditures. The Inspector General noted a discrepancy in approved budgets and actual expenditures. The House Committee expressed concerns about controversies with benefactors' control over Smithsonian properties and exhibits, including the renaming of the Air and Space Theater. The Committee recommended reopening negotiations and reviewing benefactor agreements. Previous controversies regarding the proposed closing of SCMRE and CRC were resolved. The Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) and the Conservation and Research Center (CRC) in Front Royal, Virginia faced closure in 2001 but were ultimately maintained after objections. An independent Science Commission was established to review the decision. Concerns about the Smithsonian's research priorities remain. The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities provide federal support for the arts and humanities through the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, consisting of NEA, NEH, and IMLS, was established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. NEA and NEH have been operating on temporary authority since 1993. The Institute of Museum and Library Services was created by the 104th Congress. The FY2003 appropriation for NEA was $116.5 million, with a proposed increase by the House. The floor amendment increased NEA by $10 million and NEH by $5 million by reducing Interior departmental management expenses. NEA's direct grant program supports approximately 1,600 grants, with state arts agencies receiving over 40% of grant funds. The NEA administers the Challenge America Arts Fund for arts education and community activities. NEH's FY2003 appropriation is $125.8 million, supporting grants for humanities education, research, and preservation. The NEH received $1.3 million above the FY2002 level but $5.3 million below the House-passed FY2003 level. NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs, as well as regional humanities centers and state humanities councils. The Office of Museum Services' appropriation moved to the Labor-HHS-Ed appropriations bill for FY2003 to simplify funding and reduce duplicative review. The IMLS received $245.5 million for libraries and museums under Labor-HHS-Ed appropriations. The FY2003 appropriation for IMLS is $245.5 million for libraries and museums, with $30 million allocated to the Office of Museum Services. Congress debates the federal role in funding arts and humanities, with opponents suggesting abolishing NEA and NEH, while proponents argue for continued federal support citing a long tradition of cultural support. Proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue for continued funding, citing a long tradition of cultural support dating back to 1817. Some in the private sector believe they cannot fill the gap left by the loss of federal funds. Former President Clinton recommended increased funding for NEA and NEH, while current funding represents only 84 cents per person. The debate over NEA funding continues, with past controversies resurfacing during appropriations discussions. The debate over NEA funding involved concerns about grants for potentially obscene artwork, with courts ruling on the constitutionality of applying decency standards. Congress enacted NEA reform measures in past appropriations laws, including increased funding allocations to states for arts grants. In past appropriations laws, NEA reform measures were enacted, including increased funding allocations to states for arts grants and grants to under served populations. A 15% cap was placed on NEA funds allocated to each state, with exemptions for grants with a national impact. Members of the House and Senate were added to the National Council on the Arts. NEA and NEH were given specific authority to solicit and invest funds. Funding priorities and restrictions on grants were retained in the FY2003 final appropriation. The curr_chunk provides information on the Challenge America program, the Office of Museum Services under IMLS, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum Services. It also discusses the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and its funding for land acquisition activities by various agencies. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is funded by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the National Park Service. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015, with actual appropriations totaling $12.5 billion. Appropriations for federal acquisitions are earmarked to specific management units, while the state grant program is rarely earmarked. Funding for land acquisition has increased in recent years, reaching $573 million in FY2002. The FY2003 appropriation is lower than previous years. LWCF Funding: FY2000 through FY2003 ranged from $15 million to $456 million for purposes other than land acquisition and stateside grants. Congress may continue to lower LWCF appropriations as part of efforts to address funding issues. The FY2003 LWCF appropriation request was significantly lower than previous years, with the Bush Administration requesting $532 million, less than Congress provided in FY2002. The final enacted amount of $414 million was even lower, marking a decline in funding compared to previous years. The FY2003 enacted total for the Land and Water Conservation Fund was significantly lower than the Bush Administration's request. One example of a reduction is the $15 million earmark for grants to Florida for land acquisition, which was lower than the requested $20 million. Various programs received funding from the LWCF in FY2003, including the FWS's Landowner Incentive Program, Stewardship Grants Program, Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, and the BIA's Land and Water Claims Settlements. The Bush Administration had requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the LWCF. In FY2003, the Bush Administration requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. They proposed a Cooperative Conservation Initiative to promote conservation through partnerships with BLM, NPS, and FWS. The Administration sought $50 million from LWCF and another $50 million from DOI land management agencies, totaling $100 million. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but the House showed interest in leveraging federal funds for conservation programs. The Conservation Spending Category was created in FY2001 to combine funding for various resource protection programs, including LWCF. The FY2001 law appropriated $1.21 billion for conservation programs, with additional funding through Commerce appropriations. Funding increased significantly from the previous year, with a projected growth to $2.4 billion by FY2006. The Bush Administration requested $1.26 billion for FY2002, and Congress appropriated $1.30 billion. In FY2003, the Administration did not use the Conservation Spending Category, but Congress estimated funding for conservation programs. In FY2003, the Administration did not use the Conservation Spending Category (CSC). The House Appropriations Subcommittee estimated $1.32 billion for programs in this category, with the House-passed bill providing $1.44 billion. The Senate-passed bill mentioned that the CSC was not being used due to expired legislation, but funding for FY2003 met the projected total for the CSC. The appropriations law and conference report did not include calculations for CSC funding, but most programs previously funded under that category continued in FY2003. In the 106th and 107th Congress, various reports by Jeffrey Zinn discussed funding for natural resource protection, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and managing growth issues. The Everglades Restoration plan, authorized by Congress in 1996, aims to restore the South Florida ecosystem by altering the natural flow of water and involving federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by Congress in 2000 to restore the South Florida ecosystem by redirecting excess freshwater to natural hydrological functions. The federal government, along with state and local entities, is collaborating on 68 projects over 36 years with an estimated cost of $7.8 billion, split equally between the federal government and the State of Florida. The federal government, along with state and local entities, is collaborating on 68 projects over 36 years with an estimated cost of $7.8 billion for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). From FY1993 to FY2003, federal appropriations for South Florida ecosystem restoration exceeded $1.9 billion, with state funding over $3.6 billion. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida is expected to be approximately $286 million/year. In FY2003, the administration requested approximately $260 million for restoration activities, with $46 million for CERP implementation. Restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem have received significant funding, with over $180 million appropriated for projects in the Everglades. The Department of the Interior has allocated funds for various agencies to conduct restoration projects, including the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. In FY2003, the DOI requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the region, with specific allocations for land acquisition, construction, research, refuges, and ecological services. In FY2003, the DOI requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, including funding for land acquisition, refuges, ecological services, and research. Other restoration projects in the region have also received appropriations from various agencies such as the Corps, NOAA, EPA, and USDA. In FY2003, the DOI received reduced funding for restoration activities in the Everglades, including cuts to the Modified Waters Delivery Project and land acquisitions by the FWS. The FY2003 law provided less funding than the Administration's request, with decreases for land acquisitions in Florida by the NPS and FWS. The FY2003 appropriations law provided funding for land acquisitions in Florida by the NPS and FWS, as well as for various restoration programs related to Everglades. The House and Senate passed similar levels of funding for restoration activities in Southern Florida, with some differences in allocation. The Senate reallocated funding for Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative from NPS to USGS. Differences in funding for FWS land acquisitions between House and Senate bills. Specific allocations for lands at J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Reserve and National Key Deer Refuge. Little detailed information on appropriations for FWS, USGS, and BIA for restoration activities in South Florida ecosystem. The USGS is involved in restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, funded through appropriations bills. These activities include collecting data, constructing models, and conducting studies to benefit restoration efforts. Detailed information can be found in agency budget justifications and on the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program website.

Additionally, there is $825.0 million allocated for wildland fire emergencies to repay amounts transferred from other accounts for fire fighting in FY2002. The Deficit Control Act of 1985 established discretionary spending categories including General Purpose, Highway, Mass Transit, and Conservation. The Department of the Interior Appropriations Act for FY2001 identified specific activities within the conservation spending category. Some programs in this category did not receive separate funding for FY2001-FY2003. In FY2003, funding for the CSC was not calculated in the House, Senate, and appropriations law (P.L. 108-7). The Administration is seeking $3.0 million under the DOI Departmental Management (DM) line item for the Shivaist Indian water settlement Act of 1999. $50 million is allocated for a new Cooperative Conservation Initiative, with the remaining $150 million distributed to states for land acquisition and development activities.
