    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, leading to the bill being signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of interest to Congress and constituents. The report identifies related CRS products for detailed background information and analysis of issues, with contact information for CRS analysts. It discusses issues previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and provides background on authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001. Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but began reversing these increases in recent years due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. In recent years, Congress has been reducing military end-strengths due to troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as budget constraints. The House proposed higher end-strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force in FY2017, while the Navy saw a slight reduction compared to the Administration's request. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to the authorized levels for FY2017. The final bill sets the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four of the seven reserve components and increases for two. The Senate bill proposed end-strengths identical to the Administration request. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000, aligning with the Administration's request. Congressional interest in military personnel costs and quality remains high, with focus on the annual pay raise formula indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The annual increase in basic pay is typically indexed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI). Congress has not specified an increase in basic pay for the past three years, with the President setting pay raises below the ECI. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill proposed a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers, while the Senate bill suggested a 1.6% increase. The enacted bill waived the automatic adjustment and specified an increase. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% increase in basic pay for servicemembers, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment of 1.6%. Servicemembers are entitled to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. The Senate bill proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, focusing on geographic location and paygrade instead of dependency status. It would also base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount and reduce payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The Senate bill proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, focusing on geographic location and paygrade instead of dependency status. It would also base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount and reduce payments for servicemembers who share living quarters. The new formula would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018, including those who first become entitled to basic pay on or after that date. The Secretary of Defense would need to submit proposed regulations to implement this provision to the congressional defense committees by March 31, 2017. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2017, on transitioning to a new pay structure for recruiting and retaining a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. This new structure would eliminate Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The conference report acknowledges the evolution of BAH as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The housing allowance in the military is intended as a housing benefit, shown by its tax-free nature and differentiation based on dependency status. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the allowance with compensation rather than its original purpose. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity after 20 years of service. Changes were made in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce the retirement system. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 made changes to modernize the military retirement system by reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date or those with 12 years or less of service who choose to enroll in the new system. Concerns have been raised about the impact of reducing the retired pay multiplier on retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay at any point between 8 to 12 years of service in return for a 3-year commitment. This provision allows for targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties and adjusts procedures for calculating minimum pay for active and reserve component members. The Senate bill did not adopt the provision expressing the sense of Congress for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan. However, a new provision was adopted allowing cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, a 30-day election period for the new retirement system after commissioning or transfer to active duty. Military servicemembers are eligible for retired pay after 20 years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Up to 50% of a servicemember's retired pay can be divided in a divorce. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act allows state courts to divide up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Proposed changes would redefine disposable retired pay based on pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments for spousal payments. This provision does not affect prior divorce settlements. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a monthly survivor benefit to eligible recipients of military retirees. The base amount for survivors is usually 55% of the retired basic pay, but for those who died on active duty, it was previously 75%. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training receive a lower SBP payment. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation have their SBP payments reduced by DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). The Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) is a payment made to surviving spouses to offset reductions in benefits. The enacted bill includes amendments to the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for reserve and active component members, allowing DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) when retired pay is insufficient. The bill also extends the authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018. The bill extends the authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018 and requires an independent assessment of the SBP by a federally funded research and development center. The assessment report must include the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, comparison of benefits with other sectors, and feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays for retirees and military family members. The proposals aimed to replace existing TRICARE options with TRICARE Select and Preferred, with increased pharmacy co-pays, but not for active duty members. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. The proposal would also reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by implementing new enrollment fees and deductibles. The Congressional Budget Office estimated savings and costs associated with the TRICARE proposals. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees and deductibles. The consolidation of TRICARE plans would cost DOD $0.2 billion, while increasing Medicare spending by $0.4 billion. Section 701 of the enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, modifies TRICARE Prime, and sets enrollment fees and other parameters for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also requires an open enrollment period and limits pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees and deductibles. Section 701 of the enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, modifies TRICARE Prime, and sets enrollment fees and other parameters for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also requires an open enrollment period and limits pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime. The bill also includes provisions for hospitalization, skilled nursing facility care, rehabilitation facility care, and a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, modifies TRICARE Prime, and sets enrollment fees for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. Cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options are specified in tables, with exceptions for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors. A \"reserve and young adult\" category is created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Premiums for these programs remain the same, but new cost-sharing table provisions apply. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face an annual enrollment fee. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, modifies TRICARE Prime, and sets enrollment fees for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will be subject to a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee. A report by the Comptroller General is required by February 1, 2020 to review changes in health care coverage, access to appointments, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries obtaining care without a referral must obtain a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to retail and mail order pharmacy co-pays and required refills for TRICARE beneficiaries accessing pharmacy programs. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments when using military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to retail and mail order pharmacy co-pays, required refills for maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies, and proposed annual increases in co-payments. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase, and existing law automatically increases co-payment amounts at the same rate as the annual increase in retired pay. Section 702 of the FY2015 NDAA included a pharmacy co-payment increase that took effect on February 1, 2015. The Senate-passed bill proposed allowing beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing for certain groups. It also authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little value and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. Implementing Section 702 was estimated to reduce DOD's net pharmacy costs by about $640 million over the 2017-2021 period. Implementing Section 702 of the FY2015 NDAA would reduce DOD's net pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021. It would also decrease net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. Additionally, it would lower accrual payments into the MERHCF by $1.5 billion over 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was formed on October 1, 2013, to manage shared services and the TRICARE program. The agency oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs) and aims to improve operational medical force readiness and beneficiaries' access to care. The conference report suggests consolidating MTF administration under a single agency to enhance medical readiness and lower costs. The conferees propose consolidating MTF administration under the Defense Health Agency to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance medical readiness. This restructuring aims to streamline decision-making, foster innovation, and ultimately improve the healthcare experience for beneficiaries. Section 702 of the proposal establishes a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee various aspects of military medical administration, including budget, information technology, and policy. It also outlines the roles of the services' Surgeons General as advisors to the Secretary on health matters and requires the development of an implementation plan by March 1, 2017, with a final report due by March 1, 2018. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office will review the plan. Section 703 of the enacted bill adds a new Section 1073d \"Military medical treatment facilities\" to Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code, requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel. The provision includes exceptions for access to care through non-DOD providers. The current law requires active component enlistees to be a US national, lawful permanent resident, or from the Compact of Free Association. Reserve component enlistees must be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. Citizenship requirements can be waived if enlistment is vital to national interest. The Senate bill aimed to align reserve component enlistment requirements with active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently authorized for a maximum of 10 days. Adopting servicemembers have been eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. The Department of Defense has new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking to extend parental leave to 14 days. Servicemembers adopting a child are eligible for up to 21 days of leave, while dual-service married couples can only have one servicemember take this leave. The primary caregiver can have up to 12 weeks of total leave for the birth of a child, including 6 weeks convalescent leave, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers can have up to 21 days of leave. The leave must be taken within a year of the event, and eligibility is for active component members or reserve component members on active duty. The Department of Defense has new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking to extend parental leave to 14 days. Servicemembers adopting a child are eligible for up to 21 days of leave. Approximately 60% of the active duty force has a dependent spouse and/or children. Paid parental leave is supported for recruitment and retention in the workforce. Supporters of paid parental leave in the military argue that it enhances recruitment and retention by making benefits more competitive with the private sector. However, opponents fear that lengthening maternity and parental leave could harm military readiness. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, with funding authorized for FY2016 and FY2017. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on budget neutrality for the Defense Commissary system, which must maintain current patron savings and satisfaction levels. The report stated that privatization would not replicate the benefits provided by DeCA. Critics argue that more evaluation is needed before initiating a pilot program. The assessment of DOD's plan for achieving budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018 was published on November 9, 2016. The report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for each benchmark and only partially discussed the other four elements. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense. Sections 661 and 662 of the bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries. Reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities through oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives. The FY2016 NDAA allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, implement private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. CBO estimates a decrease in direct spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining commissary benefits and revenue. The FY2016 NDAA allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, implement private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for at least six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no current DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay. DOD can contract with grocery industry experts to improve commissary operations. Military Star Card can be used as payment at commissary stores. The FY2016 NDAA allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, implement private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for at least six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no current DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay. DOD can contract with grocery industry experts to improve commissary operations. Military Star Card can be used as payment at commissary stores. Debate and the National Defense Authorization Acts (H.R. 1735 and S. 1356) focus on military personnel issues, budget neutrality for the Commissary and Exchange System, and audit of fresh produce contracts for the U.S. Pacific Command Theater. The FY2016 NDAA allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, implement private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. Three programs for veterans are highlighted: Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and DOD Skillbridge program. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation for credentialing programs. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on specific transition initiatives for servicemembers. Section 3590 sets deadlines for processing. The FY2016 NDAA allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, implement private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. Sections 561, 567, and 568 of the final bill highlight programs for veterans such as TAP, COOL, and DOD Skillbridge. Section 3590 sets deadlines for processing applications for TWIC for separating military servicemembers. Sections 562, 563, and 564 require DOD to provide various services to separating servicemembers as part of TAP. Section 566, which would have authorized a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members, was not adopted. The most senior officers in the military are known as general officers or flag officers, holding important positions in the DOD. The total number of GFOs in each grade is limited by statute, and Congress periodically reviews and revises their number, duties, and compensation. Section 910 of the House bill would have required specific commanders to serve under a combatant. The House bill revises the number, duties, and compensation of GFOs, including reducing the total number of active duty generals and admirals. The Senate bill proposes a 25% reduction in authorized active and reserve GFOs, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. It also eliminates certain grade requirements in specific areas like medical and legal. The Senate bill aims to reduce the number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 110 positions by December 31, 2022. This represents an 11% reduction in authorized positions, with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps all seeing decreases in their GFO numbers. The bill also allows the Department of Defense to adjust the grades of GFOs without specific statutory requirements. The Senate bill aims to reduce the number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 110 positions by December 31, 2022, representing an 11% reduction in authorized positions across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The bill also allows the Department of Defense to adjust the grades of GFOs without specific statutory requirements. Additionally, Section 501 provides temporary allocation of 30 additional GFO positions to the joint pool for contingency operations, with provisions for the Secretary of Defense to alter reductions in the interest of national security. Reporting requirements and a comprehensive global manpower study are also mandated, with results due by April 1, 2017. In 2017, Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is debate over the qualification requirements for joint qualified officers. Joint matters involve unified action by integrated military forces across different domains. The requirements for becoming a joint qualified officer involve completing specific joint professional military education and a full tour of duty in a joint assignment. Joint duty assignments are typically two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers, but this length may be waived by the Secretary of Defense. Proposed changes aim to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers. The proposed changes aim to standardize joint duty assignments at two years for all officers, expanding the definition of joint matters to include various duties such as intelligence, fires, movement, and maneuver. The Secretary of Defense would also be allowed to designate other joint matters. Additionally, the definition of joint duty assignment would be modified to require the officer's duties to predominantly involve joint matters. The enacted bill adopted the Senate language on joint duty assignments and the House language on the definition of \"joint matters.\" The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) provides the statutory authority for the federal government to maintain a Selective Service System (SSS) responsible for delivering qualified civilian men for induction into the Armed Forces. Most males between 18 and 26 must register with Selective Service, while women have never been required to do so. Failure to register may result in criminal penalties and loss of certain benefits. The enacted bill adopted Senate language on joint duty assignments and House language on the definition of \"joint matters.\" The Selective Service System requires men between 18 and 26 to register for the draft, with penalties for failure to do so. Recent policy changes have raised questions about extending registration to women. Some argue for maintaining the system, while others question its necessity. The final bill did not include a provision to expand registration to women. The final bill requires DOD to review the Selective Service System and potential manpower needs in emergencies. It establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine these issues over 36 months with $15 million in funding. The issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention from Congress and the media in recent years. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented policies and procedures to address these issues, including the establishment of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) in 2005. DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in 2013, with updates in 2015. Between 2012 and 2016, DOD has taken steps to implement strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military sexual assault prevention and response. Between 2012 and 2016, DOD implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, sexual assault prevention, victim services, and reporting. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military included findings from focus groups and surveys, with an estimated cost of $6.9 million. The Senate bill proposed extending reporting requirements to 2025, while the conference bill set the deadline for reports to be submitted to Congress on April 30. The feedback from focus groups and surveys highlighted concerns about retaliation for reporting sexual assault in the military. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to increase training for investigators, with the enacted bill adopting the Senate provision. The conference report expressed ongoing concern about retaliation and stated that provisions in the bill will be assessed for their impact on reducing retaliation in the military. The conferees will assess the impact of provisions in the bill to reduce retaliation in the military, focusing on metrics for preventing and responding to retaliation in connection with reports of military sexual assault. Concerns have been raised about discharge character for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving, affecting their eligibility for benefits. The bill amends the law to provide additional medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration for servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI related to sexual trauma. The enacted bill includes provisions that amend the law to apply to servicemembers and veterans who experienced PTSD or TBI in connection with sexual trauma. The definition of sexual harassment in the military is modified for investigating complaints of harassment by commanding officers. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) addresses child abuse and neglect in military homes, with concerns raised about prevention, management, and reporting. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements initiatives for prevention, education, and training, as well as responding to suspected instances of domestic abuse. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) responds to instances of domestic abuse and collects data as required by law. DOD personnel must notify state child welfare agencies of suspected child abuse. An annual report to Congress on child abuse and domestic abuse is mandated, aiming to improve reporting and oversight in military families. The Senate bill proposed employee criminal background checks for DOD domestic schools and certain local educational agencies receiving Impact Aid, but this provision was not included in the final bill. Instead, the conference report urged DOD to collaborate with local school districts to improve employment screening policies for the safety of military children. A report to Congress on identifying and addressing screening process shortfalls is required within a year of the Act's enactment. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and service regulations, following a recommendation from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. This review also considered the report and recommendations of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. The General Counsel was directed by Secretary Hagel to consider the report and recommendations of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel for a review of the military's systems for investigating and resolving adult sexual assault cases. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was established to review the UCMJ and MCM, resulting in the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress. The proposed House bill included comprehensive revisions to the UCMJ, addressing various aspects of military justice such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. The House bill proposed comprehensive revisions to the UCMJ, including changes to sentencing and the punitive articles. New offenses were introduced, such as prohibited activities with military recruits and fraudulent use of credit cards. The Senate bill also addressed various aspects of military justice, including courts-martial composition and trial procedures. The proposed Senate bill addresses various aspects of military justice, including courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Differences exist between the House and Senate language, particularly in the creation of military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria. The Senate bill also proposes changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault, adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a prohibited act punishable by court-martial. The final bill includes a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ, resolving differences between the House and Senate bills. However, some provisions were not included, such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters, an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, and changes to Art. 120 expanding the definition of committing a sexual act. The Medal of Honor (MOH) is the military's highest award for valor, but the review process has been criticized for being lengthy and bureaucratic. This has led to concerns about lost records and decisions based on conflicting evidence. The reluctance to retroactively award or upgrade medals is to maintain the award's integrity, but some believe it is overly restrictive, leading to individuals being denied deserved medals. DOD periodically reviews inquiries and historical records, with a recent review in 2016 focusing on military awards and decorations since September 11, 2001. The review process for Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, and Silver Star Medal recommendations since September 11, 2001, includes provisions to waive time limitations for certain valor awards until December 31, 2019. This allows for the awarding of medals during specific contingency operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and others. Section 583 of the final bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. Gary M. Rose is recognized for his actions from September 11-14, 1970, while James C. McCloughan is honored for his bravery between May 13-15, 1969. Section 586 requires a review of service records for eligible Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars previously awarded certain medals. Section 586 of the final bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to veterans of Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander descent who were previously awarded certain medals. The Secretary concerned can waive time limitations for the Medal of Honor if service records support the award. Congressional reports and studies related to military personnel issues are often requested or required within provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act."
