    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs were subject to periodic reauthorization. The most recent authorization was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extension acts were used after October 1, 2003, causing uncertainty in the highway and transit community. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better planning and construction. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by state, local, and private sector interests, despite delays, as it provided funding for surface transportation. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed despite delays, converting it from a six-year bill to a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream from the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources are gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, providing about 90% of the funds. The trust fund has seen several tax increases over its almost 50-year history, with the last one in 1993. The highway trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation for almost 50 years. In FY2004, tax revenues of $31 billion were allocated to the highway account and $5 billion to the mass transit account. However, in recent years, the trust fund's unexpended balance has been declining, leading to uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided the trust fund with additional future income through changes in federal gasohol taxation. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided the highway trust fund with additional future income by changing federal gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion per year starting in FY2005. However, disagreement between Congressional Leadership, the Administration, and some Members of Congress about total program funding for the next reauthorization period hindered progress. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes, while some Members of Congress proposed other mechanisms like tax changes and rescissions to support a larger program. The gasohol changes, tax changes, and rescissions were considered to support a larger program in SAFETEA. The revenue increases in the finance title were modest, mainly from cutting back on tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that these changes, combined with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, would finance the $286.4 billion program. TEA-21 changed the highway trust fund's relationship to the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting statutory limitations on obligations. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003 and introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust funding levels based on highway revenues. Despite these changes, annual revenues and expenditures still impact the trust fund's balances in the federal deficit calculation. The act aimed to guarantee discretionary spending for core highway and transit programs. The changes made by TEA-21 set a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, known as a discretionary spending guarantee. These \"firewalls\" ensured funds allocated to these categories could not be used for other purposes. SAFETEA continued this budget format largely unchanged, providing $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21. The main focus of the SAFETEA debate was on money and its distribution. SAFETEA provided over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, representing a significant funding increase for federal surface transportation programs. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. Major programs received significant new funding, as detailed in Table 1 and Appendix of the report. More information can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/. The House version of SAFETEA contained a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which was opposed by the Bush Administration and not included in the final act. TEA-21 created a mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes, allowing for increases or reductions in funding. RABA provided additional spending authority in its first three years, but in FY2003, a program reduction was called for. Congress chose to increase spending instead of reducing it, leading to a push for changes in how RABA was calculated to make revenue swings less dramatic. The SAFETEA legislation changed how RABA (Revenue Aligned Budget Authority) is calculated by using a two-year calculation and delaying calculations until FY2007. It also prevents spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance exceeds $6 billion. Transportation policy debates often revolve around regional distribution of federal highway aid, with Congress addressing funding concerns through minimum guarantee provisions in reauthorization acts since 1982. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than others. Some states, known as donor states, have long complained about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway users pay in taxes. They argue for a higher share rate-of-return, citing equity and fairness concerns. Donor states claim they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in donee states, especially in the Northeast, and emphasize their higher road dependency compared to some donee states. Southern and western donor states also highlight their fast growth areas and unique needs. The debate over equity in federal highway aid revolves around donor states arguing for a higher share rate-of-return, citing fairness concerns. Donee states counter by emphasizing the age of their infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources. They also argue for a national highway network based on needs rather than state boundaries. Additionally, donee states criticize donor states for not investing enough in their own highways while seeking federal funds. This debate has broader implications for equity remedies in federal funding distribution. The debate over equity remedies in federal highway aid has broader implications for federal funding distribution. Questions arise about the federal government's role as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%, and whether the Federal aid highway program should be converted to a revenue sharing or block grant program. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands with insufficient funding from the Highway Trust Fund. The debate over equity remedies in federal highway aid has broader implications for federal funding distribution. A bill to increase donor state shares faced challenges in the Senate due to a filibuster by donee states. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was created with \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. This required increasing overall federal highway program size to bring donor state shares up to a designated percentage. Providing equity in this way has been costly, with the minimum guarantee program under TEA21 becoming the largest highway program. Limited funding availability and practical politics have influenced the surface transportation legislation process. SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to ensure donor states receive a guaranteed rate-of-return. The Secretary of Transportation allocated funds to states for fiscal years 2005-2009 to maintain return levels. Nearly all programs under TEA-21 were subject to the equity provision, along with three new formula programs. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program to guarantee donor states a rate-of-return. It allocated funds for fiscal years 2005-2009 and included new formula programs. Hold harmless provisions were included for states meeting specific criteria. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program to guarantee donor states a rate-of-return for fiscal years 2005-2009. Twenty-seven states qualify for the program based on fuel excise tax rates. Each state receives a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments, with annual percentage floors set for each fiscal year. Funds are distributed to the STP and core programs based on specific criteria. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program to guarantee donor states a rate-of-return for fiscal years 2005-2009. Funds above $2.639 billion are distributed to core programs: IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and HSIP based on apportionment ratios. FHWA analysis estimates EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion over five years. Funding for programs is apportioned annually using SAFETEA formulas. Core programs, along with the minimum guarantee, accounted for 86% of highway spending under TEA-21. SAFETEA increased core programs from five to six. SAFETEA increases core highway programs from five to six, including IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs. Additionally, SAFETEA introduces two new formula programs: CBI and SRSP. Only a few new programs were included in SAFETEA despite considering many during reauthorization. The SAFETEA Act introduces two new formula programs: the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). These programs distribute funds based on specific factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with adjustments made under SAFETEA Act, such as eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and continuing the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. The SAFETEA Act makes adjustments to funding distribution, including setting aside funds for various programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program. It also establishes set-asides for ferry boats, ferry terminal facilities, and the Territorial Highway Program. Formula distribution is based on factors like federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities. Minimum payments to each state are set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is also addressed. The SAFETEA Act adjusts funding distribution, setting aside funds for various programs like Coordinated Border Infrastructure and Safe Routes to School. It also allocates funds for ferry boats, ferry terminal facilities, and the Territorial Highway Program. Formula distribution is based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities. Minimum payments to each state are set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP, distributed based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state compared to all states. Additionally, $90 million annually is set aside for high-risk rural roads construction and operational improvements. Funding for states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders is apportioned based on commercial truck crossings ratios. The Mexico-U.S. border funding formula includes allocations based on commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, cargo weight, and number of ports-of-entry. Funds are distributed among states based on student enrollment in schools, with a minimum allocation of $1 million per state. Non-apportioned highway programs are subject to criteria in highway laws and congressional earmarking. In TEA-21, these programs were smaller than core programs. In SAFETEA, non-apportioned highway programs are subject to congressional earmarking, with the largest allocated program being for high priority projects designated by Congress. Other significant programs include the federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. New large allocated programs include a transportation improvement program, national corridor infrastructure program, and projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The SAFETEA act includes innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to speed up project completion and leverage additional funds for highway projects. Changes were made to TIFIA and the SIB program, providing federal financial assistance for major transportation projects. SAFETEA act introduces changes in federal financial assistance for transportation projects, including lowering project size thresholds and providing funding for TIFIA's leveraging activities. It allows any state to establish SIBs with federal funds and consolidates tolling provisions. Private facility bonds under Section 1143 are also expected to have an impact. The SAFETEA act introduces changes in federal financial assistance for transportation projects, including lowering project size thresholds and providing funding for TIFIA's leveraging activities. It allows any state to establish SIBs with federal funds and consolidates tolling provisions, including a provision concerning the tolling of HOV lanes. Section 1143 of the revenue title of the act, which concerns private facility bonds, is expected to have an impact on tolling. The program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009, with $3 million allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to carry out 15 demonstration projects to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion for traffic congestion reduction. The SAFETEA act authorizes the use of tolls on the Interstate System to finance highway expansion for traffic congestion reduction. Revenues from tolls can be used for debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Toll facilities can vary prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. The program includes a pilot toll program allowing states to collect tolls on the Interstate System. Fees for express lanes must be collected electronically. The SAFETEA act allows tolls on the Interstate System for highway expansion to reduce congestion. A pilot toll program permits states to collect tolls on select facilities for construction. States must show toll financing is the best option. Restrictions prevent states from limiting road improvements near toll facilities due to diverted traffic. Toll revenues can only be used for debt, investor returns, and maintenance costs. Interstate Maintenance funds cannot be used. The SAFETEA act allows tolls on the Interstate System for highway expansion to reduce congestion. States can collect tolls on select facilities for construction, with restrictions on use of toll revenues for debt, investor returns, and maintenance costs. Section 1121 of the act allows tolling of vehicles on HOV lanes, including low emission and energy-efficient vehicles at a preferential rate. Tax-exempt private activity bonds can be issued to finance highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The SAFETEA act allows tolls on the Interstate System for highway expansion to reduce congestion. States can collect tolls on select facilities for construction, with restrictions on use of toll revenues for debt, investor returns, and maintenance costs. The act amends Section 142 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. State and local governments can issue these bonds for projects receiving federal assistance under specific titles. A $15 billion limit is set on the total bonds that can be issued, with potential substantial impact if fully utilized. The SAFETEA act allows tolls on the Interstate System for highway expansion to reduce congestion. States can collect tolls on select facilities for construction, with restrictions on use of toll revenues for debt, investor returns, and maintenance costs. The act also allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities, with a $15 billion limit on total bonds that can be issued. The ADHP is a road building program under the Appalachian Regional Commission, funded by the highway trust fund and aimed at promoting economic development in Appalachia. The ADHS roads are mostly completed or under construction, with additional federal funds needed to finish the system. The ADHP receives annual funding under TEA-21 and SAFETEA, with restrictions on toll revenues for non-federal matching funds. SAFETEA has a significantly higher number of earmarks for high priority projects compared to TEA-21. The highway title of the act (Title I) includes various earmarked categories with a total value of over $9.4 billion. These categories include projects of national and regional significance, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements, totaling over $6.2 billion in funding. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists and receive different funding amounts. The HPPs program has multiple earmarks totaling over $24 billion in the bill. Earmarks are also found in the highway, research, and transit titles, with specific projects receiving varying amounts of funding. The discussion post-bill passage has focused on how earmarks impact the Equity Bonus calculation. The bill contains earmarks for Equity Bonus calculation, categorized as \"below the line\" and \"above the line\" projects. State shares are affected as some receive more earmarked funds. Highway title earmarks include HPPs below the line and other programs above the line. Transit earmarks are not included in the calculation. Transportation Enhancements program activities are similar to TEA-21, funding various projects like pedestrian facilities and historic preservation. The Transportation Enhancements program activities include scenic or historic programs, landscaping, historic preservation, rehabilitation of transportation buildings, preservation of railway corridors, outdoor advertising control, archeological research, environmental mitigation, and transportation museums. Funding for TE activities is now set at 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program or the amount apportioned in FY2005, ensuring additional funding for enhancement projects. The TCSP program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. It provides funding for projects to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. Sec. 1117 of P.L. 109 - 59 authorizes $270 million over six years for TCSP, with $25 million for FY2005 and $61.25 million for FY2006-FY2009. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. It provides funding for projects to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. SAFETEA authorizes $270 million over six years for TCSP, with $25 million for FY2005 and $61.25 million for FY2006-FY2009, significantly more than under TEA-21. The program continues to provide funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs to promote non-motorized trips and enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, established since ISTEA, supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility by allocating funds for facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors for trails. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these purposes, with pedestrian and bicycle facilities accounting for 46.3% of activities. Other programs within Titles 23 and 49 USC also fund bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Safe Routes to School Program, a new initiative under SAFETEA, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities, to enhance safety and encourage alternative transportation options. The Safe Routes to School Program aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities, by providing funding of $612 million for FY2004-FY2009. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with the federal government covering 100% of project costs. Funds are not transferable and will remain available until expended. Funds allocated under the Safe Routes to School Program are 100% federally funded and remain available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofit organizations. The funds can be used for infrastructure projects like sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, and bicycle facilities. Additionally, funds can be used for noninfrastructure activities such as public awareness campaigns and traffic education. The Safe Routes to School Program includes activities to promote walking and biking to school, like public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and funding for coordinators. Non-infrastructure spending should be between 10% and 30% of the total amount allocated to each state. A national nonprofit organization will receive grants to operate a clearinghouse for safe routes to school programs. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), with a total of $52.6 billion over six years, a 46% increase from TEA-21. Funding distribution for transit programs has shifted, with a decrease in funding for Urbanized Area Formula Program and an increase for Non-Urbanized Formula Program. The share of transit formula funding going to the largest states decreased, except for California. The funding distribution for transit programs under SAFETEA shifted, with a decrease in funding for the largest states by nearly 8%, while the 40 least-populated states saw an increase of 11.1%. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including the addition of new programs and funding categories. Other provisions included requiring federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes as a fringe benefit and earmarks for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. The SAFETEA funding distribution for transit programs shifted, with a decrease in funding for large states and an increase for smaller states. New programs and funding categories were added, including a program to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities. This program is authorized at $339 million over FY2006-FY2009 and is not subject to labor protection provisions. The program authorized at $97 million over FY2006-FY2009 aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, including access for persons with disabilities. It is exempt from labor protection provisions and includes a new formula program for small urbanized areas, funded by a one-percent set-aside of the Urbanized Area Formula Program. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program measures transit service in areas with populations between 200,000 and 1 million. It includes factors like passenger miles per vehicle revenue mile and vehicle revenue hour. The program addresses the lack of performance factors for urbanized areas under 200,000 in population, leading to unequal funding for small areas providing higher levels of transit service. DOT was directed to study the issue and consider changes to reward extra effort in the Urbanized Areas Formula Program. The DOT studied the Urbanized Areas Formula Program and concluded that changes were needed to reward transit-intensive areas. Approximately 1% of funding will be shifted from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. The New Starts program now includes a category for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding, subject to a streamlined evaluation process. $45 million was allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. The Non-Urbanized Area Formula Program allocated $45 million for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. 20% of the program's funding will be apportioned based on a state's non-urbanized land area, while the remaining 80% will be based on non-urbanized population. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment, with 50% designated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The deployment program for maglev projects in Pennsylvania and Maryland competes for funding. The SAFETEA act reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, allocating $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for high-speed rail technology improvements. It also authorizes $50 million for rail-highway grade crossing hazards and grants to the Alaska Railroad for capital improvements. The SAFETEA act authorizes grants for corridor development, high-speed rail technology improvements, and rail-highway grade crossing hazards. It also allocates funds for the Alaska Railroad for capital improvements and establishes a program for continuous welded rail joint bar inspection. Additionally, it includes a new categorical grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). The HSIP Program, authorized under the SAFETEA act, replaces the Section 152 and Section 130 programs for roadway hazard elimination. It is funded at $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. States must allocate a portion of this funding towards safety improvements based on specific criteria. The HSIP Program, authorized under the SAFETEA act, allocates funds using three ratios based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States must prepare a strategic highway safety plan and a portion of the $1.2 billion FY2006 funding is reserved for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and high-risk rural road projects. The Safe Routes to Schools program, funded at $54 million in FY2005 and increasing to $183 million in FY2009, aims to improve children's safety within two miles of schools to promote walking or biking. A new grant program incentivizes seat belt use, with grants available for states with primary seat belt laws or high seat belt usage rates. The grant program aims to reduce motorists driving while impaired by alcohol. States must meet certain criteria to receive a grant, such as carrying out specified programs to discourage impaired driving. The program is authorized at $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. The program for reducing impaired driving includes more severe penalties for high blood alcohol content, effective alcohol rehabilitation, prevention strategies for underage drinking, administrative license revocation, and returning fines to communities for prevention programs. Grants are available for specified programs and high-risk offenders, with a total authorization of $555 million. Additional programs in the act include a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for states with child safety requirements. The Transportation Equity Act includes funding for safety training and education programs, incentive grants for states with child safety requirements, and directives for vehicle safety standards. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve highway and transit performance and safety through communication systems and monitoring equipment. The Transportation Equity Act includes funding for safety training and education programs, incentive grants for states with child safety requirements, and directives for vehicle safety standards. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve highway and transit performance and safety through communication systems and monitoring equipment. The act provides funding for ITS research and deployment, with a total annual investment of $230 million during TEA-21. SAFETEA allocates $110 million annually for ITS research, while the ITS deployment program is terminated after FY2005. The focus is on advancing and testing new technologies, improving ITS standards and architecture, and developing a national ITS program plan. Both short- and long-term research and development activities play a role in addressing transportation challenges. The federal role in research and development (RD) and technology deployment (TD) aims to address challenges in surface transportation systems, such as congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee these efforts, with a focus on advancing safer technologies and processes. FHWA's extensive RD and TD program covers all aspects of the highway system, with a significant emphasis on ITS and FHWA-administered programs. Title V of SAFETEA authorizes funds for these activities. Title V of SAFETEA authorizes roughly $295 million per year for transportation research and education activities conducted by FHWA. These funds are used to advance technologies for improving highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and studying highway policies. Specific amounts are allocated for surface transportation research, training and education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and the University Transportation Research Program. Research funds also support transit and motor carrier activities, as well as other technological objectives. Earmarked funds are allocated for specific types of research or projects, and certain institutions receive university-oriented funds. Many experts believe that FHWA's research and technology deployment funds are essential for advancing the highway system. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is evaluating the need for federal assistance in expanding freight railroads' infrastructure to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Another concern is the impact of more frequent freight train traffic on motor vehicle delays in towns and city neighborhoods. The rail issue involves the increasing frequency of freight train traffic through towns and city neighborhoods, leading to delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. Congress is also addressing the captive shipper question, focusing on high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. These issues are being debated in the 109th Congress and reflected in SAFETEA's Title IX, which requests a report on the nation's rail system performance. Congress is addressing issues with the nation's rail system, including service quality, rates, and meeting demand. SAFETEA provides funding mechanisms, such as expanding the RRIF Program to $35 billion for rail track improvements. The program aims to expedite loan availability and requires the Secretary of Transportation to approve or disapprove loans within 90 days. SAFETEA expands the RRIF Program to $35 billion for rail track improvements, with loans to be approved or disapproved within 90 days. It also introduces a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks, allocating $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009. SAFETEA provides funding for rail infrastructure projects, with grants not exceeding $20 million each and federal share capped at 90% of total project cost. Projects include improving rail connections in Chicago, eliminating grade crossings in various locations, and conducting a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980. The SAFETEA legislation provides funding for rail infrastructure projects, including grants for improving rail connections, eliminating grade crossings, and conducting a study on the nation's rail system since deregulation in 1980. It also establishes a Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program with $6 million in grants for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports. Additionally, the legislation continues the Recreational Trails Program to support the development and maintenance of recreational trails for various uses. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) provides funds for various recreational trail uses, including hiking, biking, horseback riding, and off-road vehicle activities. The program is authorized $370 million in contract authority for FY2005-2009, with funds allocated to states based on a legislative formula. States must use 30% of their RTP funds for administrative expenses. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is subject to annual obligation limitations like other federal-aid highway programs. States must allocate 30% of RTP funds for motorized trails, 30% for non-motorized trails, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates waivers for the 30% provision but keeps the small state exemption. The federal share for RTP projects is now based on a sliding scale. States are encouraged to use youth conservation corps for trail construction and maintenance. RTP funding can now be used for non-law enforcement trail safety and monitoring patrols. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) funding can now be used for non-law enforcement trail safety, monitoring patrols, and trail-related training, with a limit of 5% of the state's apportionment. Additionally, funding is permitted for trail condition assessment for accessibility and maintenance. SAFETEA allows pre-approval planning and environmental compliance costs to be credited towards the non-federal share for RTP projects. Before proceeding with highway or transit projects, DOT must comply with environmental review requirements, including those of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation (DOT), to consider environmental impacts before final decisions on federally funded actions. NEPA mandates the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for projects with significant environmental effects, an environmental assessment (EA) for projects with unclear impacts, and categorical exclusions for projects with no significant impact. Compliance with NEPA is essential for DOT projects. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is required within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) applies to publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites, prohibiting their use for transportation projects unless no feasible alternative exists. Environmental streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment. The timely delivery of federally funded transportation projects is a priority, with improved interagency cooperation identified as crucial for success. TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation to develop a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. SAFETEA includes provisions to further streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, primarily focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. The provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations by designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of agencies, and setting decision-making deadlines. The term \"streamlining\" is not used in SAFETEA, but the goal remains the same. Key provisions in SAFETEA aim to streamline the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. This includes establishing a new entity called a \"participating agency,\" setting deadlines for decision-making, limiting judicial claims to 180 days, allowing transportation funds to expedite reviews, and providing a dispute resolution process for disagreements. States are also given authority to determine certain projects as categorical exclusions. SAFETEA provisions streamline environmental review process for highway and transit projects. States can determine projects as categorical exclusions. Section 4(f) allows use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with de minimis impacts determination. DOT to issue regulations on prudent and feasible alternatives within one year. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 directed the Secretary of DOT to establish the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Funding was authorized for projects to reduce carbon emissions. The CMAQ program, established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, provides funding for projects aimed at reducing carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter emissions from transportation. Funding is apportioned based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs, with guaranteed minimum apportionments for states without nonattainment areas. The program allows for various types of projects, such as transportation control measures, emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. Diesel retrofit projects are given funding priority under SAFETEA. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects such as advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It also changes requirements for states receiving minimum apportionment to use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. DOT, in consultation with EPA, evaluates a sample of CMAQ projects to assess their impact on air quality and congestion levels. No direct funding is provided for this evaluation or the maintenance of a project impact database. Under the Clean Air Act, areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million people were required to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reach air quality attainment. The Clean Air Act prohibits federal funding for projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs, ensuring they do not worsen air quality or delay attainment of standards. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must demonstrate conformity every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to increase due to emissions from SUVs and light trucks. The growth of emissions from SUVs and light trucks, along with increased vehicle miles traveled, has made it harder to demonstrate conformity. Recent court decisions have tightened conformity rules, and stricter air quality standards will expand the areas subject to conformity. Metropolitan areas may face a temporary suspension of funds unless emissions are reduced. A 2003 survey by the Government Accountability Office found that only 5 areas had to change transportation plans due to conformity lapses in the previous six years, but one-third of planners expect future difficulties. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity and only allows a one-year grace period for nonattainment areas. Limited exempt projects can be funded in lapsed areas, but new projects that could reduce emissions are not allowed. Concerns include a mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles, with calls for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between required transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to align conformity rules. Transportation planners generally supported this recommendation. The Clean Air Act requires less frequent conformity demonstrations and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. P.L. 109-59 also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity. Transportation planners and highway builders support these changes, while environmental groups and air quality planning officials oppose them."
