Today, the U.S. government is a major donor to initiatives like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), providing significant funding for child vaccine campaigns abroad. This ongoing support raises concerns in Congress regarding funding oversight, donor coordination, and the promotion of U.S. foreign policy and health security through global vaccination efforts. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched in 2000 to address declining global momentum and funding for child immunization campaigns. Donor-backed vaccination efforts have reduced mortality in poor countries, but have faced setbacks. Progress in vaccination rates stalled in the late-1990s due to various challenges. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched in 2000 to address declining global momentum and funding for child immunization campaigns. GAVI has supported the immunization of 700 million children and the United States provides funding and holds a rotating seat on GAVI's board. Vaccinations are cost-effective in preventing infectious diseases, with WHO recommending 10 vaccines for all children. Childhood vaccinations can protect against illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases, saving around 3 million lives per year according to UNICEF. Coverage of recommended childhood vaccines varies globally, with high levels of morbidity and mortality in certain low- and middle-income countries. Some high-income countries have seen increases in vaccine-preventable diseases. According to GAVI, global immunization campaigns have led to significant reductions in child deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. In 2018, 66 million children were immunized, with approximately 100 million children receiving vaccinations each year. However, 20 million infants and children worldwide had not received the full schedule of recommended vaccines by the end of 2018. Full vaccination coverage could prevent one in seven deaths in under-5 children, with over 1.5 million children dying annually from VPDs. Nearly 60% of these deaths occur in 10 countries, including Angola, Brazil, DRC, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Global coverage for recommended vaccines has been increasing over the past decade, with measles vaccination alone averting an estimated 15.6 million deaths from 2000 to 2017. In 2017, scaled-up measles vaccination coverage prevented 15.6 million deaths. Global coverage for recommended vaccines has increased, but DTP3 vaccination progress has stalled. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are fatal to neonates and pregnant women. Maternal and neonatal tetanus has been nearly eliminated globally, with 14 countries still affected. In 2018, 86% of children under one received all three doses of the DTP3 vaccine. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for four out of five under-5 child deaths. In 2015, U.N. member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to reduce child mortality rates. International efforts led by WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI aim to decrease vaccine-preventable deaths among children under five, with significant U.S. support. Several organizations, including WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, receive significant U.S. support for global immunization programs. UNICEF is the largest global purchaser of vaccines, focusing on providing vaccinations, monitoring vaccine supply and quality, vaccine innovation, and disease eradication. WHO launched a strategic framework on vaccines in 2005 to extend immunization achievements. The WHO launched its first 10-year strategic framework on vaccines in 2005, with the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy aimed at extending immunization achievements. The GVAP for 2011-2020 was released in 2010 to align with the WHO's 2015-2030 strategic goals, including promoting new vaccines and ensuring quality. The WHO also provides evidence-based immunization policy recommendations through SAGE. GAVI, a public-private partnership, was founded in 2000 to support global immunization efforts. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, is a multilaterally funded public-private partnership founded in 2000 to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from VPDs. The Phase IV strategy for 2015-2020 aligns with the goals outlined in the GVAP, aiming to immunize 300 million children by 2025 and save 5-6 million lives in the long term. Various factors affecting global immunization coverage include vaccine hesitancy, stigma, geographic location, inadequate country capacity, and poverty. In 2019, some countries saw a resurgence of measles due to vaccine hesitancy. The WHO reported a 300% increase in global measles cases compared to 2018, with surges in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. Factors like corruption and authoritarian governance can fuel vaccine hesitancy by undermining trust in authority figures. Nigeria struggled to eliminate polio due to conspiracy theories and vaccine stigma. Geographic distance from health centers negatively impacts vaccination coverage, especially in underserved populations. Vaccine coverage disparities between urban and rural areas persist worldwide, exacerbating disease spread. Low-income countries have lower vaccination coverage rates compared to high-income countries, due to underfunded medical systems and individual socioeconomic determinants. Researchers have found that inequities in vaccination coverage are associated with individual socioeconomic determinants, such as family income and maternal education. Children born into poverty are at higher risk of mortality, with unequal access to vaccines being a key factor. Fragile and conflict settings, including armed conflict and humanitarian challenges, hinder vaccination efforts and disease containment. Refugee camps and displacement centers can facilitate the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Congress has historically supported global child vaccination programs in conflict-affected countries, funding immunization activities through various agencies like CDC, USAID, and GAVI. In 2019, the Democratic Republic of Congo saw a surge in measles cases, surpassing the death toll of the ongoing Ebola outbreak. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) work with global partners like GAVI to support international vaccination programs. They align with strategic frameworks and plans to strengthen immunization programs, enhance supply chain management, and finance research and development efforts. Their initiatives also support the Global Health Security Agenda and the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals. The CDC collaborates with international partners like WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank to fund research and development of vaccines. The CDC's Global Immunization Division coordinates global immunization activities, focusing mainly on polio. Global vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced polio cases worldwide, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan reporting wild polio cases in 2018. Funding details for the CDC's Global Immunization Program are provided in Table 2. The CDC's Global Immunization Division has reduced worldwide polio cases by 99% since 1988, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan reporting wild polio cases in 2018. Vaccine-derived poliovirus is still detected in Nigeria, but no cases have been confirmed there in three years. The CDC's programming is based on its 2016-2020 Strategic Framework for Global Immunization, which aims to control, eliminate, or eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases globally. The CDC collaborates with USAID, UNICEF, GAVI, and other stakeholders to implement the strategic framework aligned with the HHS National Vaccine Plan and the WHO Global Vaccine Action Plan. Congress appropriated more funding for CDC global immunization programs in FY2019. In FY2019, Congress appropriated more funding for CDC global immunization programs than the Trump Administration sought. The Administration's budget requests for FY2019 and FY2020 would have reduced funding for global immunization activities. USAID works with foreign countries' ministries of health to strengthen routine immunization campaigns and community-based disease surveillance. This includes providing funding to GAVI and training community volunteers in countries like Ethiopia to identify symptoms of vaccine-preventable diseases. The United States provides significant support for multilateral immunization programs through contributions to international organizations like GAVI. GAVI, a public-private partnership founded in 2000, aims to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. The U.S. plays a central role in GAVI's governance, strategic planning, and funding, accelerating access to vaccines and strengthening delivery platforms. The United States is the third largest donor to GAVI, providing nearly $2 billion of the $21 billion donated since its founding. Congress appropriates funding for GAVI through USAID's Global Health Programs account. The U.S. holds a seat on GAVI's board and has increased funding for the organization during the Obama Administration. Despite proposed cuts by the Trump Administration, Congress has maintained or increased funding for GAVI, showing continued support for child vaccinations overseas. In FY2018, Congress showed interest in supporting child vaccinations for VPDs overseas by appropriating increased funding. Global outbreaks of VPDs have raised concerns about maintaining progress in preventing communicable diseases. Congress may examine the effectiveness of global vaccination campaigns for domestic pandemic preparedness. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the US have been linked to travelers from abroad and domestic vaccine hesitancy. The CDC reports that these factors are the main cause of outbreaks in the US. The full Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) discussed preventable disease outbreaks in the US, including imported cases of vaccine-preventable diseases. Congress is considering oversight of vaccine issues, misinformation campaigns, and foreign aid programs supporting immunization. The Trump Administration requested cuts to global health funding, focusing on countries with the greatest public health impact. The CDC will focus global immunization activities on countries with the highest disease burden to eradicate polio, eliminate measles and rubella. Concerns have been raised about stagnation in vaccination coverage and resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases due to flat support for global vaccine campaigns. Questions arise about burden sharing and the efficacy of global campaigns to increase vaccination rates."
