    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products. However, courts have limited consumer actions to enforce laws against goods made with forced labor, resulting in minimal enforcement actions in the past 80 years under Federal law. (5) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if contractors engage in trafficking or forced labor. United States courts also have jurisdiction over these crimes committed abroad. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows United States courts to have criminal jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors involved in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. Executive orders and Acts prohibit Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. The Executive order and Acts mandate Federal contractors to maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan, including a complaint mechanism. Congress acknowledges the severity of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking, calling for legislation to prevent these abuses and provide consumers with information on ethically produced goods. Legislation is needed to inform consumers about products free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Public disclosures can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting these crimes through tainted supply chains. Legislation is necessary to disclose information on efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. Regulations will be promulgated within a year of the enactment of the Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015. The covered issuer must disclose policies addressing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. This includes maintaining a policy to identify and eliminate risks, prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors, and evaluating/addressing forced labor risks. The covered issuer must disclose efforts to evaluate and address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the product supply chain. This includes describing identified risks, measures taken to eliminate them, specifying third-party evaluations, and consultation with labor organizations or workers. The covered issuer must disclose efforts to evaluate and address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the product supply chain. This includes consulting with labor organizations or workers, specifying the entities consulted and the method of consultation, and ensuring audits of suppliers within the supply chain to investigate working conditions and labor practices. The covered issuer must verify suppliers' systems for identifying risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. They should also evaluate if these systems comply with the issuer's policies and require suppliers to attest to compliance with labor laws. Internal accountability must be maintained. The covered issuer must maintain internal accountability standards, supply chain management, and reporting procedures for issues related to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Employees and management responsible for supply chain management should be trained on mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. The covered issuer must ensure labor recruitment practices comply with policies to eliminate exploitative labor practices contributing to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Efforts should be made to provide remedial action to victims identified within the supply chain. The regulations require covered issuers to disclose information on their website under the label 'Global Supply Chain Transparency'. The Commission will also publish a list of covered issuers and the measures they have taken to address labor exploitation within their supply chain. The regulations mandate covered issuers with annual global receipts exceeding $100,000,000 to disclose measures addressing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. The information will be compiled and published by the Commission. The curr_chunk discusses international standards related to slavery and human trafficking, defines \"remedial action\" and \"supply chain\" for covered issuers disclosing information on forced labor and child labor. The curr_chunk defines \"the worst forms of child labor\" as child labor that violates national and international standards, including International Labor Organization Convention No. 182."
