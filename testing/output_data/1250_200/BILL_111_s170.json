    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that coastal and estuarine areas are vital habitats for commercial fish, shellfish, coastal birds, and natural plant communities. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 recognizes the importance of these areas and establishes a partnership for their protection. The National Estuarine Research Reserve system relies on designated areas for long-term protection and research. Development pressures in coastal watersheds necessitate effective coastal management. The need for coastal managers to protect and conserve coastal and estuarine areas is driven by intense development pressures. Acquiring interests in undeveloped coastal lands from willing sellers is a cost-effective way to provide permanent protection from development. Permanent protection of coastal lands is essential for maintaining and enhancing coastal and estuarine areas, benefiting the United States through water quality protection, public beachfront access, wildlife habitat conservation, and support for sport and commercial fisheries. Federal, State, and nongovernmental organization pilot land acquisition projects have significantly contributed to the long-term health of coastal and estuarine systems. Enhanced protection of estuarine and coastal areas is crucial. Conserving coastal and estuarine lands through watershed-based acquisition strategies can support the economic and natural resource bases of communities in the coastal watershed. Well-managed forests in these areas demonstrate outstanding ecological, recreational, historical, and aesthetic attributes. Establishment of Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to protect important coastal and estuarine areas threatened by conversion. The program is administered by the National Ocean Service through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. Property acquisition grants are provided to coastal States with approved plans for acquiring property or interests in property. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to acquire property for Coastal Zone Management Plans, National Estuarine Research Reserve management plans, or State watershed protection plans. Grants are allocated through a competitive process to coastal States or National Estuarine Research Reserves. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program requires participating States to identify conservation needs, evaluate property impacts, and demonstrate the ability to leverage funds for protection. Awards are based on need and collaboration with various entities. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program involves various entities such as Federal programs, State agencies, and private organizations. The governor or designated lead agency must ensure consistency with the State's coastal zone plan. Priority is given to lands with ecological value. The Secretary consults with Federal agencies and non-governmental entities for guidelines. States or Estuarine Research Reserves can allocate grants to local governments for assistance. The Secretary of the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program may allocate grants to local governments or eligible agencies, acquire lands in cooperation with entities, and ensure property acquisition from willing sellers. Performance measures will be developed to evaluate the program's effectiveness and submitted to Congress every 3 years. Matching requirements dictate that Federal funds must be matched by non-Federal funds for grants under the program. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program requires that Federal funds for projects be matched by non-Federal funds, with a maximum federal share of 75 percent. The Secretary may waive this limitation for underserved communities or for other reasons deemed appropriate. If a grant does not cover the total project cost, other Federal funds can be used, subject to matching requirements. The non-Federal cost share for a project under the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program can include the value of land or conservation easements acquired within 3 years prior to project submission. Land held by a qualified conservation organization can also be used. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program allows costs associated with land acquisition, management planning, remediation, restoration, and enhancement to be used as non-Federal match. At least 15 percent of funds are reserved for National Estuarine Research Reserves, and administrative costs are limited to 5 percent. The Secretary must report all expenditures to Congress annually. The Secretary must report expenditures to Congress annually. Grant recipients must provide assurances on property management and title if acquired with program funds. Funds from property sales must be returned to the Secretary for redistribution in the grant process. Definitions for terms related to property management and conservation easements are provided in this section. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary to carry out the Act for fiscal years 2009 through 2013."
