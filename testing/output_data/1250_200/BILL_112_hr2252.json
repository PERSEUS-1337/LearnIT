    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their duty is to the public at large. Examples include a case in Washington D.C. and a report from the Department of Justice on crimes of violence in 1989. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith also mentioned that police only responded to a fraction of calls for help in Dade County. In 1989, the Department of Justice reported 168,881 crimes of violence with delayed police response. Over 2.4 million Americans use firearms for self-defense annually, with 92% using them to scare off attackers. In 2001, two brothers used firearms to protect their lives and livelihood during a fatal shooting in Reisterstown, Maryland. They encountered several burglaries at their concrete business and shot and killed one burglar while injuring two others. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges against them. Two injured men were charged with burglary, while two others were also charged in connection with previous burglaries at a warehouse. The brothers were concerned about a stolen gun. In a separate incident in 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, shot and injured a robber. The clerk faced potential criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card and violating state firearms laws. Illinois law only allows individuals with ownership or proprietary interest to carry a gun in a place of business. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner in Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting a robber attempting to break into his home. The homeowner was charged because the robber was not technically inside the home. In January 2004, a Wilmette, Illinois homeowner was charged and convicted for owning handguns in violation of the village handgun ban ordinance. A homeowner in Illinois faces a potential $750 fine for not renewing his firearm owner's identification card after shooting a home intruder. The intruder entered the house twice, prompting the homeowner to confront and shoot him. The intruder then stole the family's car to go to the hospital and was charged with burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. Police officers and law-abiding citizens using firearms for protection are granted immunity from prosecution. Law-abiding citizens using firearms for protection should not be sued by violent felons they defended against. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed by law, allowing individuals not prohibited by law to possess firearms for self-defense purposes. Individuals have the right to bring legal action in federal court for damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees if their right to possess firearms for self-defense is violated. The action must be taken within 5 years of discovering the violation."
