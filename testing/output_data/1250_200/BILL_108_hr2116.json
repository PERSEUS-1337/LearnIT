    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining created large amounts of waste tailings and was a significant source of lead and zinc during World War I. The site is located in a flood-prone area and much of the mining took place on Indian land. In the early 1900s to the 1970s, the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that generated millions of tons of waste tailings. The Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling chat aboveground for later reprocessing. Congress passed the Small Producers Lead and Zinc Mining Stabilization Act in 1960 to boost production. As mining declined, the underground mine workings refilled with water, leading to the formation of acid mine water that began discharging at the surface in 1979. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was placed on the National Priorities List in 1983. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to remediate the acid mine water at the site but concluded in 1994 that it was essentially impossible. The site has over 1,300 mine shafts and 100,000 boreholes, with open mine shafts serving as a source of recharge to underground mine workings. Millions of tons of chat, laced with toxic heavy metals like lead, scar the surface area and contribute to flood problems in the surrounding communities. The stockpiled chat also stores water that recharges the underground mine workings. The stockpiled chat at the Site has been used in construction, contaminating residential areas with heavy metals like lead. The Environmental Protection Agency remediated yards with unsafe lead levels in 1994. Studies show elevated blood lead levels in children, causing health issues. Dust from the chat poses a health risk due to mining leaving underground cavities. Scientific studies indicate that dust from the stockpiled chat at the Site poses a health risk. Subsidences, some over 100 feet in diameter, have occurred due to underground cavities left by mining, affecting populated areas and schools. No government agency has addressed the chat or subsidence dangers, and there have been no comprehensive epidemiological studies of the Site. The unique environmental problems make the Site unsuitable for human habitation. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will work towards a comprehensive resolution for the environmental and health issues in the area."
