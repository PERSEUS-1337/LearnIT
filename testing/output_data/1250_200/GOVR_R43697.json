    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in West Africa, with nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO updates on EVD cases can be found at http://www.who.int/ebola. Due to limited disease surveillance capacities in the region, WHO estimates actual Ebola cases may be higher than reported. Concerns exist about weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries missing EVD cases. Mali reported its first EVD case on October 23, with suspicions of undetected cases in Cote d'Ivoire. WHO is sending a team to Mali for clinical management, contact tracing, and social mobilization. Efforts are underway to develop drugs for EVD treatment. WHO plans to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms, reducing the fatality rate. Disease spread can be limited through surveillance and containment measures outlined in WHO manuals. The Ebola virus circulating in West Africa is not new, and health experts are familiar with methods to treat and contain it. However, the disease is spreading quickly due to ill-equipped health systems in affected countries. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country outbreaks. Disease transmission along shared borders has led to imported cases in other countries. Contact tracing and disease containment efforts have been successful in halting the spread in some areas. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to imported cases in other countries, with successful containment efforts in Senegal and Nigeria. However, new cases are being investigated in Mali. The current outbreak is spreading in both rural and urban areas, posing challenges for responders due to limited resources and healthcare facilities. Ebola transmission has also been reported in the United States and Spain among health workers caring for patients. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading rapidly in urban areas with limited access to clean water and healthcare. Cases are doubling every 15-40 days in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A separate outbreak in the DRC has resulted in 66 cases and 49 deaths, with congressional actions accelerating to address the situation. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is accelerating, with congressional hearings and legislation recognizing the severity of the situation. Congress allocated $88 million for the Ebola response, including funds for CDC activities and research on treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was authorized to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in affected countries were already weak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have become overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. Deficiencies in these areas enable the virus to spread. The outbreak has led to mistrust of government responses, attacks on health workers and facilities, and the use of armed forces for disease control measures, deepening public resentment. Some countries used armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, sparking public resentment. Criticisms of quarantines include concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and unrest. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped some quarantines following protests and expert criticisms. Per capita health spending in affected countries is low, leading to poor health facility conditions and delays in compensation for health workers. Absenteeism and worker shortages have been exacerbated by safety concerns and frustration over unpaid salaries during the Ebola outbreak. Several health workers in Liberia abandoned their posts due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, have offered financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources for their Ebola response plans and require support. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the outbreak. Inadequate access to health personnel and facilities is a significant issue in all three countries. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia has left many without access to medical care, leading to people caring for the ill on their own. This shortage of medics and health facilities has also impacted non-Ebola related health issues, such as maternal and child health. Before the outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were already high, with a significant number of deaths occurring due to pregnancy-related complications and childhood illnesses. High maternal and child mortality rates in the Ebola-affected countries are attributed to the lack of healthcare workers. Before the outbreak, Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people, while Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors. The evacuation of expatriate doctors during the outbreak further depleted the healthcare workforce, leaving only around 50 doctors in Liberia to provide clinical care. This shortage of medical personnel has led to preventable deaths from treatable ailments and common medical conditions surpassing Ebola-related deaths in Liberia. After the Ebola outbreak, Liberia was left with only around 50 doctors to provide clinical care, as many expatriate doctors were evacuated. The shortage of healthcare workers was exacerbated by Ebola deaths among health workers. WHO reported that 443 health workers contracted EVD, with 244 deaths, mostly in Liberia. The affected countries needed over 13,000 health workers for Ebola control, with only 5% from foreign countries. Countries are deploying medics to the region to address the severe shortages. The Ebola outbreak has severely impacted healthcare in affected countries, with limited access to clinics and closed health facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone. This has led to delayed health-seeking practices, reducing survival prospects for those sickened by Ebola. The lack of essential health services like Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, and contact tracing is hindering efforts to control the outbreak. Countries are deploying medics to address the severe shortages in healthcare personnel. The Ebola outbreak has severely impacted healthcare in affected countries, with limited access to clinics and closed health facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often infect more people along the way. CDC estimates fatality rates could be halved with better access to treatment. Liberia faces severe treatment shortages, but treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. support. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving in Liberia, with 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are adapting traditional funeral practices with community leaders. The poor quality of health care delivery in Ebola-affected regions is a concern, with inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols contributing to cases among health workers. CDC investigations in Liberia revealed multiple opportunities for Ebola transmission to healthcare workers, including inadequate use of protective equipment and poor sanitation practices. Limited availability of gloves, hand washing facilities, and running water in health centers further hampers efforts to contain the outbreak. The poor conditions of health facilities in Ebola-affected regions, including lack of running water and protective gear, contribute to the spread of the disease. Shortages of ambulances and limited access to appropriate protective equipment put healthcare workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola. The poor conditions of health facilities in Ebola-affected regions contribute to the spread of the disease. Shortages of protective gear and antibiotics hinder healthcare workers in treating Ebola. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is challenging due to poor road conditions and limited air service. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty and infrastructural deficiencies still pose barriers to avoiding infection. Consumption of wild animals is common in areas with high food insecurity. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number and location of cases. Limited access to food in affected areas drives people to continue hunting and consuming wild animals, despite the risks. International responses are increasing, but the ultimate cost of containing the outbreak remains uncertain. International responses are accelerating to contain the Ebola outbreak, with estimated costs rising from $4.8 million in March to $490 million in August. The outbreak has spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, causing over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate the international efforts. The United Nations Security Council held a special meeting on Ebola to urge member states to support affected countries. A $988 million plan was created to address health and social impacts, with $493 million already contributed. Additional funds have been pledged for immediate and long-term preparedness needs. The World Health Organization and UNOCHA will revise funding requests for ongoing Ebola outbreak response. WHO's Ebola Response Roadmap outlines the need for $490 million to build treatment centers, increase diagnostic capacity, and attract health workers. Pledges for medical support have been made, but human resource constraints hinder containment efforts. Medical support commitments have been made by various countries and organizations, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, China, the African Union, and the East African Community. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners have developed the Community Care Campaign to provide care to vulnerable households in Liberia. Community care centers will be established and managed by NGOs, community health workers, and family members of Ebola patients. The United States is a major funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are heavily involved in containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama has appointed an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses, with a focus on four key goals: controlling the outbreak, mitigating impacts, establishing leadership, and advancing global health security. The U.S. is primarily focused on Liberia, where the outbreak is most severe, but is also engaged in efforts across all affected countries. The U.S. global efforts in combating the Ebola outbreak primarily focus on Liberia, with nearly 900 government personnel stationed in the region. The response is built on prior efforts to enhance foreign nations' capacity to prepare and respond to disease outbreaks, including Ebola. USAID has invested approximately $1 billion since 2005 in helping countries detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks that have pandemic potential. Since 2005, USAID has invested $1 billion in helping countries detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks with pandemic potential, such as Ebola. The Emerging and Pandemic Threats program operates in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focusing on viral detection, risk determination, one health approach institutionalization, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak, committing over $300 million for combating Ebola. Resources provided include treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and support for public awareness, disease prevention practices, and safe burial. CDC funds its global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including the Global Disease Detection program. Appropriations for GDD have increased since 2003, with CDC requesting additional support in FY2015 to accelerate activities in response to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC also supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries through various means, including sending experts to work with WHO country offices or foreign health ministries. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in more than 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO country offices or foreign health ministries. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia to help characterize and control the Ebola outbreak, provide technical assistance, and train airport personnel. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for its Ebola responses. DOD focused on researching treatments and vaccines, providing laboratory diagnostic assistance, and announced additional support for the outbreak. The DOD responded to the Ebola outbreak by providing research on treatments and vaccines, offering laboratory diagnostic assistance, and setting up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia. President Obama launched \"Operation United Assistance\" with 4,000 military forces deployed to Liberia to coordinate relief efforts, train health workers, and establish treatment centers. The first 22-bed treatment center is expected to be completed by the end of October. The DOD has set up 12 treatment centers in Liberia with 100-bed capacity. The first 22-bed ETC is expected to be completed by the end of October, with three more to follow in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel, including personnel from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are in the region operating mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved funding for Operation United Assistance and other related activities, with total DOD funding for the global Ebola response expected to exceed $1 billion. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with insufficient capacity to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of the disease. Congress has enacted legislation to expand U.S. and international responses and provide funds for U.S. responses. The Administration may request additional funds to contain the Ebola outbreak. WHO estimated it would take 13,000 health workers to contain the outbreak. Human resource constraints are most acute in Liberia. The United States has partnered with the Liberian government, WHO, and other groups to develop a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concern about the Community Care Campaign. The WHO warns that Community Care Centers could become \"contamination centers\" without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, supervision, diagnosis, and burial methods. Key factors complicating safe implementation include quality control, inconsistent adherence to infection protocols, and concerns about family care providers spreading Ebola. WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in the CCCs to prevent further spread of the virus. The WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in Community Care Centers to prevent further spread of Ebola. Compliance with this guideline may be challenging due to common collective familial care practices in Liberia, as well as factors such as loss of income and emotional stress. Infection prevention protocols require strict use of personal protective equipment and proper waste management practices within CCCs to prevent the spread of the virus. The affected countries face deficiencies in waste management, with less than 20% having access to improved sanitation facilities in 2012. Ensuring strict adherence to IPC protocol among lay care takers without medical training may be a challenge, especially if they lack access to sanitation. Oversight and monitoring are critical for success, with once daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers recommended. Supply chain management issues affect publicly funded health clinics in the affected areas. Due to poor supply chain management, health clinics in affected countries lack essential protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, leading to EVD infections among health workers. WHO advises a gradual approach to ensuring continuous supply of commodities to Community Care Centers. The US has already provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. The White House reports that the US Government has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. Questions arise about US oversight of grantees managing Community Care Centers and the standardization of quality control. Critics have raised concerns about WHO's leadership in the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced the organization's effectiveness. Critics question WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak, citing bureaucratic issues and weak health systems in affected countries. Debates continue on whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity. Suggestions include establishing a Health Systems Fund and ready-to-deploy emergency health responders. Donors struggle with addressing health emergencies in dysfunctional health systems. The weak health systems in West Africa have been a major factor in the spread of diseases. Donors have debated on how to address health emergencies, with some supporting disease-based funding through non-governmental groups, while others argue it worsens human resource shortages. The introduction of PEPFAR intensified this debate, as U.S. agencies provided funding outside of government networks to combat HIV/AIDS, saving millions of lives but also creating dependency on U.S. support. In the second phase of PEPFAR, increasing resources were used to support health systems to build country capacity. Debate has resumed on the use of PEPFAR funds for health system building, with concerns that budgetary reforms may jeopardize efforts. The U.S. Congress faces a similar dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries require focused support to contain it. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak as affected countries need focused support to contain it. Donors must support the development of strong health systems to prevent future disease outbreaks. USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to bolster health systems post-outbreak. No specific appropriations target health system strengthening efforts. While U.S.-funded health programs have tried to respond to calls for greater investment in health systems, appropriations mainly target specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader health system strengthening activities. The ongoing Ebola outbreak is being addressed by various U.S. agencies, with the Department of State leading diplomatic efforts, USAID coordinating responses, CDC heading public health activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows for flexibility in responding to unforeseen events. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic engagements through existing channels without requiring additional funding. CDC outbreak responses can be financed through various accounts, while DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. USAID receives specific directives from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak without reprogramming funds. USAID is reprogramming funds to address the current Ebola outbreak, including responses to H7N9 avian influenza and MERS-CoV. Supporters view the appropriation structure as a tool for overseeing health programs, while opponents argue it limits agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with surveillance and response mechanisms, impact can be minimized. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is 30% less than FY2014. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, 30% less than FY2014. Even if funded at the FY2014 level, it may not be enough to meet current demands. Experts predict containment by end of January, but high death tolls are causing long-term effects. MSF reports villages in Sierra Leone losing adult members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns rise for growing number of Ebola orphans, already vulnerable due to fear of the virus. Countries in West and Central Africa have large orphan populations from various causes. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to a significant increase in orphan populations, with over 4 million children losing parents to AIDS in 2012. The outbreak is straining government capacity to address health issues, potentially leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. The full health effects of Ebola may not be known until containment. This could spark a debate on the allocation of U.S. global health assistance funds, with concerns about worsening health and development issues such as maternal and child mortality, orphanhood, and poverty. The Ebola outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa has raised concerns about health and development issues, including maternal and child mortality, orphanhood, poverty, and water-borne infections. Therapeutic options for Ebola remain undeveloped, with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested, but the ethical debate surrounds the equitable distribution of these resources. The WHO announced it is ethical to offer unproven interventions for Ebola treatment. Testing of two vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers is planned for January. Limited experimental treatment may be available in Liberia by early November. Discussions are ongoing to fast track testing and distribution. Discussions were held with various stakeholders to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines. WHO warned neighboring countries of Ebola risk, with Mali reporting its first case. Concerns arise about future outbreaks in forested areas where fruit bats reside. Future Ebola outbreaks may occur in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity. Questions arise about the effectiveness of the U.S. response, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, impact of disease-specific funding, reprogramming of USAID funds, and capacity building in affected countries and the region."
