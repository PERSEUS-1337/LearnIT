    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration must use a specific method to determine these estimates for the following calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes from a facility producing biofuel from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires determining the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production during a specified period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires determining the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on actual production during a specified period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates calculating the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires determining the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility in the current calendar year based on the average monthly production volume. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimating the total production of cellulosic biofuel for the upcoming year based on the combined annual volumes of all production facilities. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify using exact production data and requiring a specific volume for reduction. Amendments to the Clean Air Act require changing \"may\" to \"shall\" and \"same or a lesser volume\" to \"same volume\" in the second sentence. The definition of Cellulosic Biofuel is also revised to exclude certain sources like compressed natural gas and electricity from biogas produced from specific facilities. In relation to the Clean Air Act, regulations regarding cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways are being revised to align with recent amendments. The Environmental Protection Agency is required to update rules to comply with the changes made. Additionally, adjustments are being made to the cellulosic biofuel mandate. The Clean Air Act is being updated to align with recent amendments, including revisions to regulations on cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways. The Environmental Protection Agency must update rules accordingly. Additionally, adjustments are being made to the cellulosic biofuel mandate for calendar year 2014."
