    "content": "The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" aims to ensure that legislative powers are solely held by Congress as per the Constitution. It requires regulations proposed by the executive branch to be approved by Congress before taking effect, promoting accountability and democracy. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS.\n\nRegulations cannot take effect before the enactment of a bill containing the regulation's text. Agencies must submit a report to Congress with the proposed regulation's text and an explanation of its basis and purpose.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS. (a) Introduction.--Within three legislative days of an agency submitting a report under section 3(b), the Majority Leader of each House of Congress must introduce a bill containing the regulation's text. If not done, any Member may introduce the bill. \n(b) Bill.--A bill refers to a legislative document that approves agency regulations as law. \n(c) Referral and Consideration.--The bill does not go to a committee and can be considered by any Member the day after announcing their intention. Points of order can be raised during consideration. The motion to proceed with the consideration of a bill is highly privileged and not debatable. Once agreed to, the respective House must immediately consider the bill without delay. Debate on the bill is limited to one hour, with equal time for supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is permitted. An amendment to the bill is not allowed. Limiting debate is permitted and not debatable. Postponing the bill, considering other business, or reconsidering the vote is not allowed. Appeals on Chair decisions regarding Senate or House regulations are decided without debate. Final passage of the bill must occur within 60 days. Suspending subsections (c) and (d) requires a majority vote. If the other House has acted, specific procedures apply. Upon passage of a motion, the bill will be treated like other bills. If the other House has passed a bill with the same text, it will not be referred to a committee in the receiving House. The procedure will be the same, but the final vote will be on the bill from the other House. Once the other House's bill is dealt with, the original bill is no longer considered. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" in accordance with existing laws. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions."
