    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations in progress that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. TPA grants the President fast track authority to consider trade agreements without amendment, provided certain conditions are met. TPA, or Trade Promotion Authority, is a tool that Congress uses to exercise its authority over trade policy while giving the President negotiating leverage. It has evolved over time to include tighter oversight and consultation requirements, leading to more controversy over its renewal. The central questions now are when and in what form TPA might be renewed, as it is the result of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch. The evolution of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) shows the need for cooperative flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. Congress has authority over foreign trade, while the President negotiates treaties. Both branches play a role in developing and executing trade agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates for imports. In the early years of the United States, Congress controlled foreign trade by setting tariff rates. The President's role was to negotiate and implement bilateral treaties. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 significantly changed U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates during the Great Depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed high tariff rates during the Great Depression, leading to retaliatory tariffs by major trade partners and worsening the economic effects. In response, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to enter into agreements to reduce tariffs within predefined levels, delegating expanded trade authority to the executive branch. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 granted the President expanded trade authority to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea, not receiving MFN status. Congress renewed presidential trade agreements authority for tariff reductions 11 times until 1962, with general tariff levels declining and the significance as a trade barrier diminishing. The establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 shifted the major forum for trade negotiations. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reduction agreements. The act expanded Congress's role in the negotiating process and allowed the President to conclude the GATT Kennedy Round, focusing on reducing tariffs and addressing nontariff barriers. The Kennedy Round addressed nontariff barriers (NTBs) through agreements on customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress opposed these agreements as they required changes beyond tariff modifications, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. This highlighted the increasing importance of addressing NTBs in future trade agreements, which would necessitate changes in U.S. law. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements that reduced tariffs. It also required Congress to pass implementing legislation for agreements that required changes beyond tariff modifications. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, with Congress required to pass implementing legislation for agreements that required changes beyond tariff modifications. Congress agreed to give trade agreements expedited treatment to address concerns about unlimited debate and amendment procedures potentially hindering negotiations with U.S. trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, allowing expedited treatment for trade agreements. Congress required limited time for committees to consider implementing bills, with no amendments allowed during time-limited debate on the floor. The act also mandated consultation with relevant committees and notification to Congress before signing agreements. Additionally, 10 Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. This authority facilitated the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT, resulting in agreements on non-tariff barriers. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 focused on NTBs like government procurement practices, product standards, customs regulations, and antidumping procedures. It extended fast track trade negotiating authority until 1988 and allowed tariff modifications by proclamation. Congressional procedures for trade agreements authority have remained unchanged since 1974. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for trade agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. It added trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The act waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but limited expedited procedures to agreements before June 1, 1991. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the U.S. Trade Representative failed to consult adequately. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the U.S. Trade Representative failed to consult adequately. In response to the Uruguay Round negotiations, Congress passed H.R. 1876, extending the authority until April 16, 1994. The Trade Act of 2002 renewed fast track authority after a hiatus since 1994. In 1998, Congress failed to pass new trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. Republicans wanted more limited coverage than Democrats and the Clinton Administration. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations also contributed to Congress's decision. The Trade Act of 2002 renewed fast track authority as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), with new provisions for labor and environmental issues. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act included the Congressional Oversight Group for consultation. Labor groups and some Members of Congress opposed TPA for not mandating enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. The Trade Act of 2002 renewed fast track authority as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) with new provisions for labor and environmental issues. It included the Congressional Oversight Group for consultation. The original House version of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act passed by one vote largely along party lines. The legislation was combined in the Senate with other trade-related acts and approved. The 2002 version of TPA allowed Congress to approve implementing legislation for Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority Act was introduced in 2015. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority Act (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. It was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. The legislation, passed in May 2015, contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It also adopts provisions on labor and the environment. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority Act (BCTPA) introduced in 2015 contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It also includes provisions on labor, the environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used to consider agreements from ongoing negotiations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority Act (BCTPA) introduced in 2015 aims to reduce or eliminate trade barriers on goods to promote the environment and consider agreements from the Doha Round of WTO negotiations. Through TPA/fast track, Congress seeks to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track trade negotiating authority to address nontariff barriers in trade agreements, requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation for agreements to enter into force. This authority includes expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, ensuring adherence to trade policy priorities and reaffirming Congress's authority over trade agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track trade negotiating authority for qualifying bills, known as trade implementing bills. These bills must meet certain conditions, including progress in meeting negotiating objectives and approval of the agreement by Congress. Expedited procedures are enacted by Congress to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track trade negotiating authority for trade implementing bills, giving Congress control over approval and implementation of trade agreements. The President can enter into force agreements by notifying Congress in advance, providing required changes to U.S. law, and transmitting the final legal text of the agreement. The President transmits the final legal text of the trade agreement, a draft implementing bill, a statement of administrative action, and supporting statements to Congress. If Congress is satisfied, expedited legislative procedures are followed, requiring immediate action on the bill and representing a departure from ordinary procedures. Congress plays a crucial role in trade policy through Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. TPA involves the introduction of implementing bills in Congress, limited debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade for the U.S. economy and global benefits. The President must adhere to these objectives during trade negotiations to expedite the consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for U.S. trade policy under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. Congress establishes objectives in three categories: overall, principal, and other priorities. These objectives guide trade negotiations by setting broad and specific goals, such as reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. Consultation with Congress is also a key obligation. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation establishes crucial trade negotiating objectives in three categories: overall, principal, and other priorities. These objectives guide trade negotiations by setting goals such as reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. The language defining these objectives has been contested in the past, leading to controversy in the renewal process. The labor provisions, emphasized in all objectives, have been a point of contention, particularly regarding enforceable standards. This issue has been evident in debates over specific trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation sets trade negotiating objectives in three categories: overall, principal, and other priorities. The labor provisions have been a point of contention, especially regarding enforceable standards, as seen in debates over specific trade agreements. The TPA authority is extended to the President with consultation requirements, including with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers. The notification and consultation requirements have been revised in each renewal of authority. The President must conduct notifications and consultations before negotiations and agreements under the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. This includes notifying Congress, consulting with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), and providing special consultations on specific issues such as agriculture and tariffs. The President must also notify Congress of intentions to enter into agreements, consult on the nature and potential effects of the agreement, and notify revenue committees of any potential changes to trade remedy laws. The consultation process under the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation involves notifying Congress, consulting with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), and providing special consultations on specific issues like agriculture and tariffs. It also includes notifying revenue committees of any potential changes to trade remedy laws. The process aims to ensure that trade policy remains under the purview of the legislative branch by allowing opportunities to influence trade negotiations. The effectiveness of this consultation process has been questioned, with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluating it based on multiple interviews. The consultation process under the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation involves notifying Congress, consulting with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), and providing special consultations on specific issues like agriculture and tariffs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated this process and found that despite extensive consultations with Congress on FTAs, many congressional staff felt they did not have enough time to provide input and that the process did not always allow for meaningful exchanges of views. Concerns have been raised about the need for greater and earlier congressional input into trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation aims to streamline the consultation process with Congress on trade agreements. TPA procedures were adopted by Congress to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners. Congress retains its constitutional authority over trade matters and includes provisions in TPA to limit expedited procedures. Renewals of TPA provide limited time for expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows for congressional oversight over trade agreements. TPA-2015 extends the procedures for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021, without a deadline for implementing legislation. The President must request an extension of TPA authority, which can be granted unless a disapproval resolution is passed by either House of Congress. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows for congressional oversight over trade agreements. TPA-2015 extends procedures for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021, without a deadline for implementing legislation. Resolutions must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees, and failure to fulfill consultation and reporting obligations may result in Congress withdrawing TPA procedures for an implementing bill. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows for congressional oversight over trade agreements. TPA-2015 extends procedures for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021, without a deadline for implementing legislation. Resolutions must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees, and failure to fulfill consultation and reporting obligations may result in Congress withdrawing TPA procedures for an implementing bill. A CCR is triggered if either committee of jurisdiction reports implementing legislation unfavorably, and different procedures subsequently are followed in each chamber. The Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides that expedited procedures for trade implementing bills are enacted as rules of procedures for each house, with the recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules at any time. Congress reserves its constitutional right to withdraw or override the expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote by either house. Cooperation between the legislative and executive branches is crucial for the success of TPA. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows for congressional oversight over trade agreements. Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been absent since at least 1993, with certain procedures integrated into the process of congressional approval of trade agreements. Congress insists on reviewing a trade agreement before introducing the implementing bill, followed by hearings and informal markup sessions. The Ways and Means and Finance Committees conduct informal markup sessions and mock conferences to review and amend the draft trade agreement implementing bill. This process allows committee members to raise concerns and suggest changes before the final legislation is introduced. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in the markups and reinforce congressional positions. The Administration may make clarifications or translations of key points in the final bill without altering the basic agreement. In the final implementing bill, the Administration can make clarifications or translations of key points without changing the basic agreement. Congress can suggest changes, but the Administration has discretion in accepting them. Side agreements or letters may be added to trade agreements to include additional obligations after the original agreement is signed. Side agreements or side letters can involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed. They act as clarifying devices and can address specific issues in bilateral FTAs. Side agreements and letters accompany the agreement but do not change its text, requiring official signatures from all negotiating parties to be considered in force. Enforcement of these agreements remains untested, relying on informal commitments between Congress and the executive branch. The Bush Administration accommodated special interests in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill to secure congressional support. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and President Obama faced criticism for delaying a request for its renewal. He eventually requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may consider revamping the 2002 law that governs TPA due to perceived outdated elements. The technical changes that may be contemplated regarding Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) include building consensus on trade policy, signaling congressional support for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and defining negotiating objectives. The timing of TPA renewal is also a key consideration, with suggestions to wait until negotiations for a specific FTA are near completion. FTA nearing completion provides rationale for congressional action. TPA should be addressed early in negotiations for Congress to weigh in on critical matters. U.S. trade negotiating objectives have expanded with changing trade structure, including new topics like state-owned enterprises and regulatory cooperation. TPP negotiations highlight issues such as trade effects on SMEs and global supply chains. The implications of FTAs on global supply chains and the treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements are key considerations for Congress. The Trade Act of 2002 led to partisan disagreements, delaying approval of FTAs until a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2007. The \"May 10th Agreement\" included significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have set a baseline for future trade agreements. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on the May 10th Understanding commitments in trade agreements, with concerns raised about further improvements. TPA-2015 includes key provisions on labor and environmental issues, but there are uncertainties about the extent of IPR provisions. Congress has expressed dissatisfaction with the executive branch's execution of trade negotiation consultation processes, especially in the context of TPP negotiations. The issue of dissatisfaction with trade negotiation consultation processes, especially in the context of TPP negotiations, has gained new life with the TPP negotiations. Key concerns include ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process and have access to draft texts. There is bipartisan interest in enforcing trade partner commitments, with separate legislative efforts addressing trade enforcement. Members emphasize the importance of being kept current on trade agreement negotiations to influence the text and participate meaningfully in drafting implementing bills. President Obama has established the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to enforce trade agreements. Congress may need to address trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues with TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress may need reevaluation, including the interpretation of \"necessary or appropriate\" provisions in implementing legislation. Some Members may want to define this language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility in applying the standard. Some argue for defining the \"necessary or appropriate\" language more precisely in TPA, while others prefer flexibility. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills raise the question of time limitations. Changes to FTA text after negotiations may have violated TPA, prompting consideration for addressing this issue in TPA renewal. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority or extending it for specific agreements like the TPP. TPA allows for fast track authority in trade negotiations, with options for renewal or extension for specific agreements like the TPP. Congress could grant permanent TPA authority in a two-tier procedure. Without TPA, trade policy can still progress through other agreements and measures. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about expedited procedures. In the 114th Congress, legislation to renew TPA was signed by the President on June 29, 2015, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes consultation requirements with Congress and private sector advisers, along with trade negotiating objectives covering various topics like goods, services, intellectual property, labor, and environment. The bills include new trade policy issues such as digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and currency as principal negotiating objectives. Congressional Trade Agreements Authority has been granted to Presidents since 1934, with expedited legislative procedures under TPA. Under TPA expedited procedures, mock markups are held by House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees to review draft legislation. The vote and amendments made during these meetings are not binding on the Administration. The President then sends the final legal draft of the trade agreement and implementing bill to Congress, which must be introduced in each house and referred to the relevant committees. The committees have 45 in-session days to report the bill, or it will be automatically discharged. Under TPA procedures, implementing bills subject to expedited review are considered revenue bills. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on the House bill. Once reported or discharged, any Member can motion to consider the bill with limited debate. The bill passes by a simple majority, with the second House typically taking final action on the bill received from the first House. The implementing bill under TPA procedures is considered a revenue bill and goes through a process where both houses ultimately act on the same measure. Once the bill is signed, it enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation, following assurance from the USTR and exchange of notes with the trading partner government."
