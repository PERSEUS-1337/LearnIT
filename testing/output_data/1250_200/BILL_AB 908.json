    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2655 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to determine an individual's weekly benefit amount based on the wages earned during the highest quarter of their disability base period. The table sets forth different weekly benefit amounts corresponding to wage brackets. The table shows weekly benefit amounts based on wage brackets ranging from $1,400 to $1,749.20. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1991, if an individual's highest quarterly wages exceed $1,749.20, the weekly benefit is 55% of those wages divided by 13, capped at $266 or the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability amount. If not a multiple of $1, round up to the next dollar. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2000, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the individual's highest quarterly wages exceeding $1,749.20, divided by 13, with a cap at $336. For disabilities starting between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2018, the weekly benefit amount is also 55% of the highest quarterly wages exceeding $1,749.20, divided by 13, not exceeding the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount. For disabilities starting between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2022, the weekly benefit amount is calculated to the next higher multiple of one dollar if not already a multiple of one dollar. If an individual's wages during the highest quarter of their disability base period are less than $929, the weekly benefit amount is $50. When an individual's wages during the highest quarter of their disability base period are $929 or more but less than one-third of the state average quarterly wage, 70 percent of those wages divided by 13 is used to calculate the weekly benefit amount, rounded up to the next dollar if necessary. The weekly benefit amount for an individual is calculated based on their wages during the highest quarter of their disability base period. It is determined as either 23.3 percent of the state average weekly wage or 60 percent of the wages earned during that quarter divided by 13, whichever amount is greater. The weekly benefit amount cannot exceed the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount set by the Department of Industrial Relations. For disabilities starting on or after January 1, 2022, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the highest quarter wages, not exceeding the maximum set by the Department of Industrial Relations. The \"State average quarterly wage\" is the state average weekly wage multiplied by 13. The State average quarterly wage is calculated by multiplying the State average weekly wage by 13. The Department is required to submit a report to the Legislature by March 1, 2021, detailing data on paid family leave and disability insurance utilization, benefit costs, and supplemental disability insurance contribution rates. The report, due by March 1, 2021, will include projections for the years following 2022. It must be submitted to various committees and will be repealed on January 1, 2024. Section 3303 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is also being amended. Section 3303 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to provide family temporary disability insurance benefits for bonding with a minor child or caring for a seriously ill family member. Eligibility criteria include making a claim, a seven-day waiting period, and filing a required certificate. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2024.
