    "content": "The Act titled \"North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017\" requires a report on designating the government of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. Congress found that North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988, but this designation was rescinded in 2008 due to commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. However, North Korea has not upheld these commitments, posing a growing threat to the United States and global nonproliferation efforts. The Government of North Korea has harbored members of the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking and provided material support for a 1972 terrorist attack in Israel. North Korea has also been found to have materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah. In 2014, a US district court found North Korea supported Hezbollah's terrorist attacks against Israel. In 2010, North Korean officials were convicted of attempting to assassinate a dissident. In 2015, South Korea blamed North Korea for a cyber attack on nuclear power plants. The FBI concluded North Korea was responsible for cyber attacks on Sony Pictures and threats against theaters. Malaysian authorities alleged North Korea's involvement in poisoning Kim Jong-nam with VX nerve agent. Congress believes North Korea likely meets criteria for designation.
