The Act, known as the \"Federal Computer Security Act,\" defines key terms related to federal computer systems, including terms like agency, covered agency, logical access control, and multi-factor logical access controls. The Act also requires an Inspector General report on federal computer systems. The \"Federal Computer Security Act\" mandates that within 240 days of enactment, each Inspector General of covered agencies must submit a report to the Comptroller General and relevant committees detailing logical access standards for accessing Federal computer systems containing classified or personally identifiable information. This includes a list and description of access controls used, and whether multi-factor controls are in place. The covered agency must report on the use of multi-factor logical access controls for Federal computer systems containing classified or personally identifiable information. Additionally, they must describe data security management practices, including software inventories and licensing agreements for security controls. The covered agency must report on the use of software security controls for monitoring and detecting threats, including data loss prevention and digital rights management software. They should also describe their policies for ensuring that entities providing services to the agency implement data security management practices. The report required under this section may be based on an audit, evaluation, or report relating to programs or practices of the covered agency. It may be submitted as part of another report and can include a classified annex. The report shall be made available to any Member of Congress upon request. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment, analyzing impediments to agency use of security software and devices. The report may include a classified annex but will be in unclassified form."
