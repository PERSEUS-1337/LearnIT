    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State Board of Equalization in California amends Section 8670.40 of the Government Code to collect a fee for regulatory costs related to oil spill prevention. The fee will not exceed $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is imposed on owners of crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries in California. The fee is collected per barrel for each delivery that passes over state waters, whether from within or outside the state. The rebuttable presumption exists for crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries in California, indicating they passed over state waters. Operators can overcome this presumption with evidence showing otherwise. The State Board of Equalization is restricted from petition for redetermination and claim for refund under the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law. The State Board of Equalization can accept petitions for redetermination or claims for refund of fees based on whether crude oil or petroleum products passed over state waters. They will forward appeals to the administrator for review. The oil spill prevention and administration fee must be remitted to the State Board of Equalization by refinery or marine terminal operators on the 25th day of the month based on the volume of crude oil or petroleum products received. The fee will not be collected if it has already been paid at another facility, and operators can presume the fee has been previously collected for petroleum products derived from in-state crude oil. The administrator annually prepares a plan projecting revenues and expenses over three fiscal years, setting the fee to match expenses. Any surplus may be allowed for contingencies. The adjusted fee rate is notified to the State Board of Equalization and takes effect after 30 days. The moneys collected from the fee shall be deposited into the fund, with the State Board of Equalization responsible for fee collection and regulations. The fee is used for oil spill prevention programs, research, environmental studies, emergency response programs, and funding the Oiled Wildlife Care Network. The fund moneys cannot be used for spill response. Section 46008 defines a \"barrel\" as 42 gallons of crude oil or petroleum products. Section 46018 is repealed, and Section 46101 is amended to require registration for those operating refineries, marine terminals, or pipelines related to crude oil or petroleum products. Every person operating a refinery in the state or a marine terminal must register with the board for Section 8670.40 purposes. The Legislature intends for the State Board of Equalization to collect the oil spill prevention fee only upon the first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal, not on subsequent movements of the same crude oil or petroleum products."
