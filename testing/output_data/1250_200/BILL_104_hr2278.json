National security exceptions are also outlined. SEC. 3 of the \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" outlines national security exceptions for importing spent nuclear fuel, including exemptions for countries suspected of nuclear weapons development. The President must notify Congress in advance. SEC. 4 requires port authorities to establish guidelines for safe shipment of certain materials. Port authorities have the authority to establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports, ensuring public health and safety. Guidelines may include worker training, response plans for emergencies, and community notification. Port authorities have the authority to establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports. Local communities must be informed of the unloading, transfer, or shipment of the fuel, with guidelines including standards for storage and transport, and prohibitions against movement under certain conditions. Radiation exposure levels for workers must not exceed public exposure standards. The guidelines for safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports must be more protective than other laws. Existing laws on fuel transfer do not prevent the adoption of stricter guidelines. The Act does not impact the port's liability in handling nuclear materials. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, \"port authority\" as an authority with jurisdiction over port operations in the US, and \"repository\" as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Act defines \"repository\" as per the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and \"spent nuclear fuel\" as defined in the same Act."
