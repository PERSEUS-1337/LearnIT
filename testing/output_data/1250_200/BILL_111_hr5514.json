States receive funds through different means and some are more effective in spending taxpayer dollars. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to objective data for comparing government performance and costs. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings in a format that uses total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. This will objectively compare government performance and costs to ensure taxpayers are getting the best value for their dollar. State governments receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget before the end of the fiscal year. The report should include a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with unit-cost summaries. The Director will publish these reports on their website within 30 days. Additionally, there will be standardization of State fiscal accounting reports. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports to allow for comparison. State governments must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days. A classification system will be established for agency activities based on the submitted descriptions and relevant data. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison. State governments must submit program descriptions within 180 days. A classification system will be established for agency activities, identifying conduct and performance measures for each activity. Performance measures will be electronically linked to agency activities in published reports. SEC. 5. UNIT-COST SUMMARY. Each unit-cost summary for a State government budget entity shall be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE requires a budget entity to identify sources of funds available for expenditure, including State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined appropriate by the Director. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. The agency activity line item listing requires identifying the agency activity, total funds expended, activity units, and unit cost. It also describes conduct, purposes, and beneficiaries of the activity. The determination of expenditures for agency activities involves allocating funds to similar activities with measurable accomplishments. Payments to contractors or subordinate entities must be included in total expenditure calculations. Unit-cost for agency activities is determined using a specific formula. The formula for determining adjusted expenditures of a budget entity involves UC (unit-cost), m (amount), and q (number). Reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures must identify and explain any differences. The formula for adjusted expenditures involves EXP, PT, and REV, where EXP is total expenditures, PT is pass-throughs, and REV is reversions. Pass-throughs and reversions must meet criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance results in a 10% withholding of federal financial assistance. Rules are also established. The Director is authorized to make rules necessary for the Act. Definitions include \"State government,\" \"budget entity,\" \"agency activity,\" and \"Federal financial assistance.\""
