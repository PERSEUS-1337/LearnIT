    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, the most abundant fossil energy resource in the US, accounts for over half of electricity generation and can supply the country for 250 years at current rates. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. The text chunk discusses the reduction of pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21%, the potential for new technologies to improve efficiency and eliminate emissions, and the importance of continued research towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for coal technologies in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives and agencies is required. Timing for this assessment is within 120 days of enactment. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals within 120 days of enactment, followed by final goals submitted to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs related to achieving specific goals. Recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities are also required. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs related to achieving specific goals. Recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities are also required, with due weight given to expert advice. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies under various Acts to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. SEC. 7 authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This is in addition to existing authorizations and does not cap Department of Energy fossil energy research. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for new or existing power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. A plan outlining program elements, management structure, and technical milestones must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The plan must include technical milestones for advanced coal-based technologies at facilities serving coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts, aiming for efficiency improvements and enhanced environmental performance. The plan must include means of recycling coal combustion wastes, capturing carbon dioxide at low costs compared to existing technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. The regulations specify emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on the type of boiler and heat input levels. For sulfur dioxide, the limits range from 5% to 15% of potential combustion concentration. Nitrogen oxide emissions are set at 0.1 pound per million British thermal units for most boilers, but 15% of uncontrolled emissions for cyclone-fired boilers. Particulate matter emissions are limited to 0.02 pound per million British thermal units. The regulations specify emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on the type of boiler and heat input levels. Emissions must meet specified levels or comply with Clean Air Act standards during construction of advanced coal-based technology. Financial assistance is provided for projects producing coal combustion byproducts with economic value without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. The Secretary provides financial assistance for projects reducing coal usage costs, enhancing coal competitiveness, meeting energy criteria, and applicable to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal share of project costs funded should not exceed 50%, with an authorization of $100,000,000 annually for this purpose. The Secretary is authorized to use $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for fossil energy programs. Any unobligated funds can also be used for clean coal technology projects, reducing the appropriations for that fiscal year accordingly."
