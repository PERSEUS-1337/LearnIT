    "content": "The House and Senate approved FY1999 defense bills, signed into law on October 17. An omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 provided additional defense funding of $8.3 billion, including funds for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and other defense-related programs. The President signed the bill into law on October 21. The President signed the annual defense appropriations bill (P.L. 105-277) into law on October 21, providing funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other purposes. The bill includes funding for DOD programs, Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund, intelligence community management, national foreign intelligence activities, and other agencies. The Administration's FY1999 budget allocated $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. The Administration's FY1999 budget allocated $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. Congressional debate over major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees approved initial 302(b) allocations for defense and other programs. Final allocations for defense subcommittees are slightly below the Administration's request, while military construction subcommittee allocations are above. The final House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays for the national security subcommittee. See Table B-1 in Appendix B for all defense discretionary funds. The House and Senate approved defense budget allocations. The House passed the FY1999 defense authorization bill on May 21, while the Senate passed it on June 25. The authorization bill conference agreement was reached on September 17 and signed into law on October 17. The House marked up its defense appropriations bill on June 17. The House and Senate approved defense budget allocations for FY1999. The House passed H.R. 4103 on June 24, while the Senate passed S. 2132 on July 30. Conferees reached an agreement on the defense appropriations bill on September 22, which was signed into law on October 17 as P.L. 105-262. The congressional budget resolution was approved by the Senate on April 2 and the House on June 5. The House and Senate approved defense budget allocations for FY1999. The House passed H.R. 4103 on June 24, while the Senate passed S. 2132 on July 30. A conference agreement on the resolution was never completed. Supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved on April 30 for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, totaling $2.7 billion for the Defense Department. Defense-related supplemental appropriations for FY1999 were approved on October 20. Defense-related supplemental appropriations for FY1999 were approved on October 20, providing additional funding of $8.3 billion for various defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. These funds are designated as emergency appropriations. The conference agreements on defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved major issues, including relations with China. The conference dropped language banning satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review from Commerce to State Department and requiring advanced congressional notification of satellite sales to China. The defense appropriations bill includes provisions transferring technology export review from Commerce to State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification of satellite sales to China, and prohibiting export of missile equipment to China without certification from the President. It also prohibits the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company and includes measures related to forced abortions in China. The defense authorization bill includes provisions prohibiting DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requiring a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. It does not approve new rounds of military base closures as requested by the Administration. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill prohibited new policies until a commission reports. The Senate rejected a Brownback amendment on June 24 and endorsed a substitute by Senator Snowe allowing current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps to separate male and female sleeping quarters. The House-Senate authorization conference adopted the Senate language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The authorization bill also included a provision for commanders to display \"exemplary behavior,\" and both chambers rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House-passed bill included a measure to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors. The House-passed authorization bill included a measure to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors, potentially requiring new facilities in South Carolina. The Senate version allowed DOE to choose the long-term option, with a one-year delay for Congress to review. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels. The House also provided a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request for a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. Both the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide the 3.6% raise. The Senate included $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding, while the House did not initially approve it. The House-passed authorization bill did not address emergency funding for Bosnia, but included a provision to cap spending at $1.9 billion. The Senate version included a statement encouraging a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement authorized $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if certified by the President for national security needs. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding initially, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia initially, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure. Contentious weapons issues were few compared to past years, with the Administration objecting to additional funding for C-130J aircraft. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure, and funding for another Theater Missile Defense system was also reduced or eliminated in the Senate bills. The appropriations conference agreement cuts funding for Theater Missile Defense systems, including MEADS and ABL programs. Funding for new aircraft carrier development was also reduced due to Navy's decision. The Navy decided not to pursue a new carrier design and instead focus on progressive changes to the current design. Funding was provided for an amphibious ship and new aircraft procurement, with some objections raised by lawmakers. The authorization conference agreement included restrictions on F-22 aircraft testing, which could be waived. The authorization conference agreement includes restrictions on F-22 aircraft testing, which could be waived. Some long-term weapons issues have been resolved this year, such as the battle over B-2 bomber procurement and the House National Security Committee not renewing its fight for a design competition in the New Attack Submarine program. Both House and Senate bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to the defense health care system. The authorization conference agreement includes pilot projects to test FEHBP for military retirees, using TRICARE as a supplement for Medicare and providing access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. Key matters discussed in the defense debate include military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, military readiness, defense modernization funding, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, and military health care policy. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget was constrained by budget agreements, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" where any additions had to be offset by reductions in other programs. Congress ultimately added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the FY1999 budget, avoiding a confrontation with the Administration over priorities. The budget constraints led to a \"zero-sum game\" where additions had to be offset by reductions in other programs. The debate over defense priorities did not materialize in House and Senate actions on the authorization and appropriations bills. The House and Senate did not engage in a contentious debate over defense budget priorities in the FY1999 bills. Some funds were allocated for unrequested weapons programs, with a notable $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The congressional defense debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report, which highlighted important ongoing themes for discussion. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and other defense reports in the late 1990s emphasized the need for a revised U.S. defense strategy, the ability to win two major wars simultaneously, efficiency measures to reduce force pressures, and the revolution in military affairs. They also called for increased efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported these points but also emphasized homeland defense and preparing for different types of future threats. Less emphasis on preparing for two major wars was suggested. The National Defense Panel report emphasized homeland defense and preparing for future threats, calling for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new technology. It recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Secretary Cohen made congressional approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 a top priority. The report on base closures reaffirms earlier estimates of annual savings from previous closure rounds. Resistance to more closures in Congress has been fueled by objections to the Administration's actions following the 1995 closure round, particularly the plan to privatize two Air Force maintenance facilities instead of closing them. The Administration's plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force maintenance facilities has sparked controversy in Congress. Lawmakers have raised concerns about politicizing the base closure process and eroding support for further closures. Secretary Cohen has suggested including a prohibition on privatization in place in future base closure legislation and has urged Congress to approve more closures to prepare for the long-term. Cohen has argued for more base closures to be approved by Congress in preparation for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action on additional base closures for FY1999 was not approved, with SASC voting down a proposal for one more closure round in 2001. An amendment by Senator Inhofe to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process was approved by the Senate but later dropped. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress will approve another base closure round in 2001. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved $1.8 billion for FY1998 and $1.9 billion for FY1999. The funding was included in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) and designated as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise spending caps. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved $1.8 billion for FY1998 and $1.9 billion for FY1999, with the latter designated as emergency appropriations to raise spending caps. The proposal to raise caps on defense discretionary spending was contentious, with Congress insisting on including ongoing military operation costs within existing defense spending caps. The Administration argued that Bosnia costs were not initially factored into defense plans, leading to the need for emergency appropriations to avoid cuts in other defense programs. In FY1999, additional emergency funding for Bosnia was requested by the Administration, with a cap of $1.9 billion set by HNSC. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia but rejected a proposal to cut off funds without congressional approval. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia without congressional approval. An amendment to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia was approved. The Senate added $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia to the defense appropriations bill. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval, which the White House threatened to veto. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the condition that the President certifies the funding is needed for national security. The appropriations conference agreement allows expenditure beyond provided funds if certified necessary for national security without reducing readiness. Emergency funding for Bosnia was not included, leaving it for future consideration. The Skaggs amendment was removed. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia was granted in the FY1999 Omnibus bill. Congressional focus on relations with China, technology exports, and trade sanctions due to allegations of assistance to China by Loral Space Corporation and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports. The White House objected to these measures, and the Senate debated China-related amendments before delaying action on the defense appropriations bill. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer amendments related to China policy, but Senator Stevens delayed floor action due to concerns about contentious amendments. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments on China. Senator Hutchinson later offered a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation, which passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions shifting technology export review to the State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. The conference agreement includes provisions on technology export review, advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and a ban on missile equipment exports to China unless specific conditions are met. Other efficiency measures recommended include staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cuts in civilian and military support personnel, and pursuing public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. The Department aims to reduce overhead personnel while facing barriers to cuts in civilian personnel levels. Congress debates cuts in acquisition personnel and privatization measures at local facilities. HNSC criticizes DOD for not complying with reporting requirements and imposes a $500 million funding cut. The House-passed authorization bill includes cuts in funding for consultants and reductions in the number of Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Military readiness issues have been a focus in congressional hearings, with concerns raised about shortages in key skill areas and equipment. The curr_chunk discusses various symptoms of a potential readiness crisis in the military, including shortages in key skill areas and equipment, as well as a decline in pilot retention rates. While some officials acknowledge problems, they argue that overall readiness remains high and issues are being addressed. The military is facing readiness problems, with shortages in key areas like Air Force engine spares and declining pilot retention rates. Efforts are being made to address these issues, including higher reenlistment bonuses and limiting deployments. Concerns about recruitment and retention have been raised by officials, leading to calls for increased defense spending. Congressional action includes restructuring operations. The Senate took action to address military readiness issues by restructuring funding for maintenance and implementing changes in reporting. Additional funds were allocated for readiness-related accounts, and amendments were approved to address family life, morale, and retention concerns. The authorization conference agreement emphasized improved readiness reporting, increased benefits for troops, and quality of life measures. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, but did not make changes to military retirement benefits. Long-term funding for defense modernization remains a concern, with procurement funding close to last year's levels due to adjustments in weapons programs following the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, relying on efficiency savings and base closures. However, achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending is challenging, as senior defense officials admit. Various factors like maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, and contingency operation expenses could hinder reaching the target. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler stated that reaching the $60 billion procurement target is becoming more difficult. Congressional action does not include substantial increases in modernization funding. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs but no other funds for weapons modernization. The QDR mandates a reduction of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, with some resistance in Congress to proposed cuts due to concerns about strain on active duty forces. The Army has long faced shortages in certain skills, relying on unit fill-outs to compensate. The Army faces shortages in certain skills and relies on unit fill-outs to compensate. Congress must agree to reduce active duty personnel levels to carry out QDR reductions. HNSC rejected the administration's request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength and approved a reduction of 11,000 fewer positions than requested. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal. The Senate approved reducing authorized end-strength by 11,000 positions, despite the Administration's request for more cuts. A dispute between the active Army and Army National Guard over combat unit roles has escalated, with Congress appointing special advisors and increased funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. Army Chief of Staff is working to ease tensions. The Army Chief of Staff has been meeting with ARNG leaders to ease ongoing disputes over Guard and reserve weapons procurement. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including major weapons programs like Missile defense. The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs, leading to less contentious debates in Congress. The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs, leading to less contentious debates in Congress. Major policy disputes remain unresolved, with advocates pushing for early deployment of a nationwide defense system. Disputes over TMD systems, including THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS, continue. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy system procurement for affordability reasons. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to provide an improved air/missile defense system for forward deployed troops. Congressional Action: In the past, provisions to require deployment of a nationwide defense have sometimes held up completion of defense authorization and appropriations bills. Congress has considered separate legislation establishing missile defense policy, with the Senate failing to invoke cloture on the bill. Additionally, Congress has approved additional funding for selected TMD programs in FY1998. The FY1998 supplemental funding bill includes $179 million for TMD programs, with additional funding for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The THAAD program faced test failures and funding cuts, with the Senate approving a $253.9 million reduction due to delays in engineering development. The House approved restructuring the THAAD program, requiring a second contractor to compete and shifting funds to technology development. MEADS funding was cut and DOD was required to study alternatives. The Senate appropriations bill shifted funding from engineering development to technology development, cut MEADS funding, and required DOD to study alternatives. SASC also reduced funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. Additionally, SAC added money to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology and endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD. The authorization conference cut THAAD and MEADS funding, prohibiting further MEADS expenditures until included in long-term defense budget plans. The agreement followed Senate increases in the Space Based Laser program. The appropriations conference agreement cuts THAAD by $376 million, reduces MEADS to $10 million, and cuts the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense with no specific allocation of funds indicated. Congressional action this year does not add money to procure more B-2 bombers, potentially marking the end of the B-2 battle. HNSC added a limited amount for B-2 upgrades, while SAC cut some funding. The defense bills for this year do not allocate funds for more B-2 bombers, potentially ending the B-2 battle. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter program. Congress reduced F/A-18E/F procurement from 30 to 27 aircraft, with concerns about the cost of the F-22 in the Senate. The Senate reduced F/A-18E/F procurement from 30 to 27 aircraft but made no changes to major tactical aircraft programs. There is a requirement for the F-22 to complete 10% of planned flight tests before the next round of procurement funding is released. The authorization conference approved funds for 30 F-18s and allows a waiver for the flight test requirement for the F-22. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. One major issue is the procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to the FY2001 budget by DOD. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal to accelerate funding was not chosen. The development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer involves Ingalls Shipbuilding, Bath Iron Works, Lockheed-Martin, Raytheon, and combat system integrators. The Navy has formed teams with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to pursue competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine. Additional funding was added for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new-design aircraft carrier and instead focus on upgrading Nimitz-class carriers. There are funding discrepancies for carrier research and development, with the Senate recommending cuts for CVX R&D and increases for CVN-77. The House Appropriations bill also reduced funding for the CVX. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for the futuristic aircraft carrier concept by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement allocated $110 million for CVX R&D. Congress also addressed other weapons issues such as procurement of F-16 aircraft and JSTARS aircraft. Congressional action included adding funds for F-16s and advance procurement for additional JSTARS aircraft. The House appropriations bill included funds for additional JSTARS aircraft, National Guard and Reserve equipment, C-130 cargo aircraft, and F-16s. The Senate provided funds for JSTARS and additional C-130s, while the SAC funded more C-130s and Guard and Reserve procurement. The C-130J funding was a contentious issue, with Rep. Obey proposing to reallocate funds to upgrade existing C-130s and restore F/A-18E/F procurement. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for C-130s, F-16, JSTARS advance procurement, and Guard and Reserve equipment. The appropriations conference agreement includes funds for C-130s, JSTARS advance procurement, and Guard and Reserve procurement account. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons and recommended pursuing leap-ahead technologies. The Defense Department is advised to reduce or terminate legacy programs and focus on leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. The Panel criticized various programs, and Congress is considering changes. SASC approved a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review and criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program. Social issues like sexual harassment are also being debated in defense funding bills. The focus of discussion in defense funding bills this year has been on sexual harassment cases in the Army and gender-integrated training. Recommendations for separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training were made by a commission headed by Nancy Kassebaum Baker. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on making changes. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, but the Senate approved a substitute allowing current practices to continue. The House and Senate were in disagreement on gender-integrated training, with the HNSC also requiring exemplary conduct from the Secretary of Defense and the President. The HNSC authorization bill includes provisions for separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training, a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training, and requirements for exemplary conduct from senior officials. Congress is evaluating defense health care issues, including the effectiveness of Tricare and health care benefits for military retirees. Congressional action ensures continued access to health care for military retirees. Congressional action was taken by HNSC and SASC to ensure military retirees have access to healthcare at defense facilities. Demonstration projects were established to test alternative healthcare options, including enrolling retirees in FEHBP, providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and offering Tricare pharmacy benefits. Additionally, defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for medical programs such as bone marrow transplants and cancer research, with the Senate setting aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, with priorities determined by the Defense Department. Funding for breast cancer and prostate cancer research should not be reduced below FY1998 levels. The House bill included separate amounts for medical earmarks. The appropriations conference agreement provided separate funds for various medical programs, including cancer research, and addressed Year 2000 computer issues. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers. However, the House Republican caucus decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and an additional $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities, but the defense appropriations bill does not provide funds for DOE. The defense authorization bill addresses tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs. The House bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium from commercial sources, while the Senate bill allows DOE to choose its preferred option. The conference agreement allows DOE to decide but delays implementation for a year for congressional review. The conference agreement on tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs allows DOE to choose its preferred option but delays implementation for a year for congressional review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, feeling it is urgent for DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The House and Senate approved bills for emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters and overseas peacekeeping efforts for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The Senate inserted provisions from S. 1768 into H.R. 3579 and passed it by unanimous consent, leading to a conference request on the amendments. In 1998, H.R. 3616 was introduced to authorize appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999. The bill went through various stages in the House and Senate, including amendments and a conference agreement, before being signed into law as P.L. 105-74 on May 1, 1998. S. 2057 (Thurmond) authorized appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999. The bill went through full committee markup and was approved by the Senate on June 25, 1998. It was then inserted into H.R. 3616 and passed by the Senate on the same day. The original bill for Department of Defense appropriations for fiscal year 1999 went through subcommittee and full committee markups, was considered by the Senate and House, and ultimately passed as H.R. 4103. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17, 1998. The conference agreement for H.R. 4328, an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999, was approved by the Senate (94-2) on September 29, 1998, and signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17, 1998. The House and Senate both approved the conference agreement, with the President signing it into law as P.L. 105-277 on October 21, 1998. Defense appropriations for FY1995 to FY1999 were detailed in the budget authority in billions of current year dollars. Administration Defense Plan for February 1998 also outlined budget authority in billions of current year dollars. The Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office provided data on Ballistic Missile Defense Funding for FY1999 in billions of dollars. Congressional actions on major weapons programs for FY1999 were also detailed, excluding initial spares and military construction costs. Military construction requests for Ballistic Missile Defense were reported separately. The military construction request for Ballistic Missile Defense in FY1999 is $17.2 million, often reported separately. Guard and Reserve Equipment funding excludes items for regular forces and C-130 aircraft. Emergency funding is not included in the omnibus appropriations bill. The FY1999 Defense-related supplemental appropriations and congressional actions on defense authorization and appropriations bills are detailed in H.R. 4328. The data includes budget authority in billions of dollars and reflects CBO scoring. Sources for the information include various House and Senate reports. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other national defense activities. Other appropriations bills fund construction of military facilities, atomic energy defense activities, civil defense activities, and activities of the Selective Service System. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense and other national defense activities. It is the largest of the defense-related appropriations measures and includes mandatory funding. The FY1999 funding breakdown by appropriations subcommittee is provided in Table B-1. The national defense budget function also includes net mandatory funding, which reflects receipts from sales of items to the public. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 are also included. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 reflect a budget agreement finalized in June 1997. Budget authority for national defense will grow slowly in nominal terms but will be essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. Defense spending has steadily declined from its peak in the mid-1980s, with budget authority almost 38% below the level in FY1985 by FY2003. Cuts in the defense budget have been achieved by reducing the military force size and slowing weapons modernization pace. The Quadrennial Defense Review, released in May 1997, outlines plans to reduce the military force size and slow weapons modernization. Active duty end-strength will decrease from 2.2 million in FY1987 to 1.36 million by FY2003. Funding for weapons acquisition has also declined significantly, with procurement funding 65% below FY1985 levels. The goal is to increase procurement funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and controlling operation and maintenance expenses. The Administration projects $61.3 billion for procurement by FY2001, contingent on achieving savings through defense business reforms. The Congress has added substantial amounts to the annual defense budget request for the past three years, but due to last year's budget agreement, they have no room to add to the FY1999 request. Table C2 shows congressional additions to the request in recent years. The CBO scoring of the Administration submission includes estimates from the Office of Management and Budget for various years. Adjustments are made for supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and technical adjustments, with significant changes in contract authority for Defense Working Capital Funds. Additionally, there are various CRS Issue Briefs on topics such as U.S. military operations in Bosnia, China-U.S. relations, Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the Department of Energy's Tritium Production Program, defense acquisition reform, F-22 and F/A-18E/F aircraft programs, homosexuals in the U.S. military, and military medical care services. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS Issue Briefs on topics such as U.S. military policy, military retirement, NATO expansion, space launch vehicles, emergency appropriations, tactical aircraft modernization, women in the armed forces, and more. The curr_chunk includes a list of CRS reports on topics such as V-22 Osprey aircraft, women in the armed forces, Army Reserve components, China missile technology transfers, defense budget for FY1999, Iraq crisis, Joint Strike Fighter, military base closures, and national missile defense. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various defense-related topics, including Navy aircraft carrier programs, maritime fire support, land attack destroyers, shipbuilding programs, and budgetary proposals for fiscal years. The curr_chunk lists various reports from the U.S. General Accounting Office on defense-related topics, including military readiness, combat air power, and Navy aviation. It also provides information on defense budget, programs, and congressional actions. The curr_chunk provides links to various defense-related websites, including Congressional sites, the Defense Department, and specific branches like the Army and Navy. The curr_chunk lists various military branch websites, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, along with budget and public affairs resources."
