    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It consists of four parts: A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services; B covers medical services like physician services and durable medical equipment; C offers private plan options for those enrolled in A and B; and D provides optional prescription drug coverage. Medicare consists of four parts: A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services; B covers medical services like physician services and durable medical equipment; C offers private plan options for those enrolled in A and B; and D provides optional prescription drug coverage. Medicare expenditures are influenced by factors such as enrollment levels, medical service complexity, healthcare inflation, and life expectancy. In 2017, Medicare served about 58.4 million individuals at a cost of $710.2 billion. The program has two trust funds - the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, overseen by the Medicare Board of Trustees. The HI Trust Fund of Medicare faces projected shortfall and insolvency, while the SMI Trust Fund cannot become insolvent. HI portion of Medicare is self-supporting and financed through payroll taxes. ACA imposes additional tax on high-income workers. The ACA imposes an additional tax on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. The HI Trust Fund receives income from various sources including premiums from voluntary enrollees, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and interest on federal securities. It is a financial account in the U.S. Treasury that operates on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. No actual money is transferred into or out of the fund. The HI Trust Fund receives income from various sources including premiums, federal income taxes, and interest on securities to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. When the fund has a surplus, it is reflected as assets on the balance sheets but is not reserved for future benefits. The HI Trust Fund receives income from various sources to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. Surpluses are not reserved for future benefits but are bookkeeping entries indicating how much Medicare has lent to the Treasury. If the fund spends more than it receives, it has a cash-flow deficit and can redeem securities accumulated in previous years. When assets reach zero, the fund is deemed insolvent. The Medicare Board of Trustees projected insolvency for the HI Trust Fund starting in 1970. The Medicare HI Trust Fund has avoided insolvency through various methods, such as adjusting the payroll tax rate and implementing legislative changes to control spending. Efforts to curtail Medicare spending intensified in the mid-1990s, leading to the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which improved the financial outlook of the HI Trust Fund. Following the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97), improvements were made in the short-term projections for the Medicare HI Trust Fund. These improvements were due to lower expected expenditures, efforts to combat fraud and abuse, and strong economic growth generating more revenues. Concerns arose that the savings from BBA 97 were greater than intended, leading to the enactment of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA 99) and the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA 2000) to reverse some spending reductions. The BIPA 2000 and BBRA 99 were enacted to reverse BBA 97 spending reductions. Despite these measures, the 2001 and 2002 Medicare Trustees Reports delayed the projected insolvency date due to economic growth and lower program costs. However, the 2003 report projected insolvency in 2026, earlier than previously expected, due to lower payroll taxes and higher hospital expenditures. The 2004 report projected insolvency in 2019, attributing the revision to slow wage growth and increased hospital benefits. Factors contributing to the revision of the projected insolvency date of the HI Trust Fund included slow wage growth, faster growth in inpatient hospital benefits, and the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The insolvency date was revised multiple times, with projections ranging from 2020 to 2017, due to various factors such as economic recession and increased utilization of HI services. The 2010 Medicare Trustees Report projected that the HI Trust Fund's assets would last until 2029, but the 2011 report revised the insolvency date to 2024 due to lower payroll taxes and slow wage growth. Despite measures like an additional HI payroll tax and spending reductions, income was still insufficient to cover expenses through 2021. The Medicare trustees projected a better short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund in their 2013 report, moving the insolvency date to 2026. The 2014 report showed further improvement, pushing the insolvency date to 2030 due to lower expenditures and changes in payment methodology. The 2015 and 2016 reports maintained the 2030 insolvency date estimate, with slight fluctuations in the short-term outlook. The 2016 Medicare Trustees Report projected a worsened short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund, moving the insolvency date to 2028 due to lower payroll-tax income. The 2017 report showed a slightly improved outlook, pushing the insolvency date to 2029 because of lower HI expenditures and reduced future hospital service utilization. However, the 2018 report projected a worsened outlook, moving the insolvency date to 2026 due to changes in HI revenues and lower projected income from payroll taxes. The projected income from payroll taxes is reduced due to lower wages in 2017 and slower GDP growth. Expectations of reduced income from taxes on Social Security benefits are also noted. Expenditures in the HI Trust Fund exceeded income from 2008 to 2015, with small surpluses in 2016 and 2017. However, expenditure growth is expected to outpace income in 2018 and beyond, leading to depletion of trust fund assets by 2026. The practical function of the HI Trust Fund is to bridge the gap between income and expenditures. The HI Trust Fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. If the fund cannot cover all expenses, it is considered insolvent. There are no provisions in the Social Security Act for insolvency. The Medicare trustees predict that the fund will be exhausted in 2026, with only enough funds to pay for 91% of benefits. The HI Trust Fund is projected to be exhausted in 2026, leading to a shortfall in funding for Medicare expenses. Without action to increase revenues or decrease expenditures, Congress may need to find alternative funding sources. Concerns about Medicare's financial status often focus on the Trust Fund's insolvency date, but the program's overall impact on the federal budget and taxpayers is also significant. Total Medicare spending obligations are expected to strain federal resources as the number of beneficiaries and healthcare costs rise. Total Medicare spending obligations are expected to increase demands on federal budgetary resources. The shift towards outpatient settings has led to a greater portion of spending being covered by beneficiary premiums and general revenues. The portion of income taxes needed to fund SMI is projected to rise significantly in the future. Expenditures have exceeded income every year from 2008 through 2015, leading to the use of Hospital Insurance assets to cover the shortfall. The HI Trust Fund used assets to cover expenditures exceeding income from 2008 to 2015. A surplus was seen in 2016 and 2017, but deficits are expected from 2018 onwards until depletion in 2026. After that, the fund may not have enough to cover Part A expenses. See Table A-1 for historical and projected Medicare financial data through 2027."
