ARTICLE II of the compact becomes operative once ratified by two or more member states. ARTICLE III designates state foresters as compact administrators to coordinate forest fire prevention and control efforts among member states. ARTICLE IV allows for mutual aid between member states in combating forest fires. \"ARTICLE V outlines the process for amending the compact.\" \"If member states provide outside aid under this compact, employees will have similar powers, duties, and immunities as employees of the receiving state. There is no liability for acts or omissions during aid provision, and any liability is borne by the requesting state. The requesting state must reimburse the aiding state for any losses or expenses incurred.\" Each member state providing aid shall be reimbursed for any loss, damage, or expense incurred in the operation of equipment, as well as for materials, transportation, wages, and maintenance. Workers compensation benefits must be provided to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. \"ARTICLE VI of the compact ensures that member states maintain adequate forest fighting forces and equipment without curtailment. It also preserves states' powers to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires. ARTICLE VII maintains cooperative relationships between member states and the United States Forest Service.\" \"ARTICLE VII states that representatives of the United States Forest Service can attend meetings of the compact administrators. ARTICLE VIII allows for reciprocal aid in combating forest fires between states party to this compact and other regional compacts.
