    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States with laws expanding firearm rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in firearm-related crime. Federal regulations currently restrict firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, hindering individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict any individual from possessing or carrying a firearm or ammunition in these areas. Federal law should clarify that second amendment rights in National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict possession or carrying of firearms or ammunition in these areas. The purpose of this section is to require hunting activities as a land use in all Federal land management plans, unless clearly incompatible. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless incompatible with land management purposes, and reasons for any restrictions must be published in the management plan. Fee charged for hunting activities on Federal land is not considered unrestricted hunting. The fee charged for hunting activities on Federal land must not exceed the costs of land management and is considered a restriction on hunting. Fees collected are used to offset management costs directly related to hunting activities on the land. Definitions in the Act include hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing under the term \"hunting.\" Management plans for Federal land include comprehensive plans for management or use, applicable to plans developed, approved, or amended after the enactment of this section."
