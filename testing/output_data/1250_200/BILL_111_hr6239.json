    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". The Congress finds that increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline for vehicles requires ensuring it won't harm emission control systems or engine performance, as concerns exist about potential negative effects on engines and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol levels exceeding the current limit to warn consumers of potential harm to some vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact of higher ethanol blends on newer vehicles, but data is lacking for older vehicles and nonroad engines. The executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit and is in the process of making a decision on this issue. Congress is considering mitigating effects on interstate commerce from a potential increase in ethanol blending limit in gasoline. Targeted liability protections are being proposed for claims related to damages caused by or worsened by the use of ethanol in certain fuel. Liability protections are proposed for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, granting immunity from suits related to various types of losses, including death, injury, illness, and property damage. Liability protections are proposed for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, granting immunity from suits related to various types of losses, including property damage and business interruption. The immunity applies to any claim for loss causally linked to the use of renewable fuel containing ethanol, regardless of when the loss occurred. Liability protections are proposed for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, granting immunity from suits related to losses. The only exception to this immunity is for a Federal cause of action against a covered person for death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct. Actions under this exception can be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury by the affected person or their representative, and must be filed in federal court. Procedures for filing a lawsuit under the exception for willful misconduct include exclusive federal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia, application of state law where the misconduct occurred, and detailed pleading requirements for the plaintiff's claim. The complaint for willful misconduct must include facts supporting the injury claimed and a verification made by affidavit of the plaintiff under oath. Any matter not specifically identified as alleged upon information and belief shall be considered as made upon the knowledge of the plaintiff. In an action under subsection (b), the plaintiff must prove willful misconduct by each covered person sued. The case will be initially assigned to a three-judge panel for consideration of motions and related matters. Civil discovery is not allowed in such actions. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is restricted until each covered person has a chance to file a motion to dismiss and the court rules on it. Discovery is only permitted for matters directly related to contested issues in the action. Under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may only compel a party to provide information if it is necessary to prove or defend a material issue in the action and the benefits of the response outweigh the burden on the responding party. In actions under subsection (b), damages awarded to a plaintiff may be reduced by collateral source benefits received. Additionally, noneconomic damages can only be awarded in proportion to a defendant's responsibility for the harm suffered by the plaintiff. Noneconomic damages cover losses such as pain, suffering, inconvenience, and mental anguish. In actions under subsection (b), damages awarded to a plaintiff may be reduced by collateral source benefits received. Noneconomic damages cover losses such as pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, and more. Rule 11 Sanctions may be imposed for violations, including payment of expenses and attorney's fees. The United States Court of Appeals for interlocutory appeal is also mentioned. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals by covered persons within 30 days of an order denying a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on immunity or exclusion. If an act or omission by a manufacturer or distributor with respect to a covered countermeasure is subject to regulation by the Clean Air Act and no enforcement action has been initiated, it shall not be considered willful misconduct. In this section, enforcement actions initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Attorney General must be resolved before any action or proceeding can proceed. The United States retains its rights, remedies, and defenses under other laws, including tort claims procedures. A covered entity is defined as an entity involved in fuel manufacturing, sale, or distribution. The term \"covered entity\" refers to an entity involved in fuel manufacturing, sale, or distribution of renewable fuel. An \"enforcement action\" includes various legal proceedings for misconduct. A \"covered remedy\" is a final outcome like a criminal conviction or injunction resulting from a court or agency decision. The term \"final\" refers to a court judgment or agency order that is not subject to further review and has not been reversed. Willful misconduct does not include actions taken in compliance with regulations or guidance. The term \"final\" denotes an act or omission taken intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose, knowingly without legal or factual justification, and in disregard of a known or obvious risk."
