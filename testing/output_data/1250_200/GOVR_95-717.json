    "content": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows tort suits to be brought against the United States by waiving sovereign immunity for some tort suits. Congress has the power to waive or qualify immunity, making the US liable for the negligent acts of its employees under certain circumstances. The FTCA allows tort suits against the United States, waiving sovereign immunity for some cases. Exceptions exist where the US may not be held liable, such as the Feres doctrine, discretionary function exception, and intentional tort exception. Other exceptions include strict liability under state law, interest prior to judgment, punitive damages, and claims related to postal matters or tax collection. The FTCA allows tort suits against the United States, waiving sovereign immunity for some cases. Claims must be presented to the federal agency before filing suit, with a two-year time limit to do so. If the agency denies the claim, the claimant has six months to file suit in federal district court. No limitations apply if the agency fails to act within six months. The FTCA allows tort suits against the United States, waiving sovereign immunity for some cases. If a claim is filed against a federal employee for a tort committed within the scope of their employment, the United States will be substituted as the defendant in federal court. The claimant must file a claim with the appropriate federal agency within 60 days after the dismissal of the suit, with no jury trials allowed. Settlements over $25,000 require approval from the Attorney General. Settlements over $25,000 require approval from the Attorney General or his designee. United States attorneys can settle claims up to $1 million. Attorneys representing claimants under the FTCA cannot charge more than 25% of a court award or settlement. Court may order the US to pay claimant's attorneys' fees only if bad faith is found. The Westfall Act, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), amended the FTCA to make it the exclusive remedy for torts committed by federal employees within the scope of their employment, providing immunity from state tort law. However, federal employees can still be sued for constitutional violations or violations of federal statutes. In United States v. Smith, the Supreme Court ruled that federal employees are immune from state tort law suits even if an FTCA exception precludes recovery against the United States. In United States v. Smith, federal employees are immune from state tort law suits even if an FTCA exception precludes recovery against the United States, as the claim arose in a foreign country. The Attorney General can certify if the employee was acting within the scope of employment, leading to the United States being substituted as the defendant in the action. If certification is refused, the employee can petition the court for certification. The Westfall Act allows federal employees to petition the court for certification that they were acting within the scope of employment. If certified, the United States becomes the defendant. The Attorney General's certification is reviewable in court, as established in Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno. The Westfall Act allows federal employees to seek certification that they were acting within the scope of employment. If certified, the United States becomes the defendant under the FTCA. Judicial review of the Attorney General's certification is allowed, as seen in Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno. In Osborn v. Haley, the Supreme Court ruled that judicial review of executive action should not be cut off unless Congress clearly intended to do so. In Osborn v. Haley, a federal employee sued in state court was certified by the Attorney General to have been acting within the scope of employment. The federal district court invalidated the certification, but the Supreme Court affirmed it, stating that the United States must remain as a defendant unless it is proven the employee acted beyond their scope of employment. The Court also examined conflicting statutory provisions regarding remanding a case from federal to state court. The Supreme Court ruled that once the Attorney General certifies a case for removal from state court to federal district court, the federal court must retain jurisdiction and cannot remand the case. This decision was made in the context of conflicting statutory provisions regarding remanding cases from federal to state court. The Supreme Court found that while there is no explicit exclusion for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service, such exclusion results from construing the act to fit into the entire statutory scheme of remedies against the Government. This is because the act makes the United States liable only \"to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\" and there is no liability for service-connected injuries against a private individual. The Supreme Court's decision in Feres was influenced by the fact that the act makes the law of the place where the act occurred govern liability, and that Congress did not provide for recovery under the FTCA affecting entitlement to compensation for injuries in the armed services. The Court concluded that the Government is not liable under the FTCA for injuries to servicemen arising out of activity incident to service. The Supreme Court's decision in Feres established that the Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen arising out of activity incident to service. The relationship between the Government and members of the Armed Forces is distinctly federal, and liability cannot depend on where the soldier was stationed at the time of injury. The Feres doctrine is based on three rationales identified by the Supreme Court in Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States. The Feres doctrine, established by the Supreme Court, provides a \"no fault\" compensation scheme for injured servicemen, regardless of government negligence. It is based on the unique relationship between soldiers and their superiors, aiming to maintain discipline and prevent extreme outcomes from suits related to military duty. The Feres doctrine, established by the Supreme Court, provides a \"no fault\" compensation scheme for injured servicemen, regardless of government negligence. Each case must be examined individually in light of the statute as construed in Feres and subsequent cases. Factors determining if the doctrine bars a suit include second-guessing military decisions and impairing military discipline. Other factors like the federal nature of the government-military relationship and alternative compensation systems are no longer controlling. In Atkinson v. United States, a servicewoman brought a medical malpractice suit under the FTCA for injuries suffered in an Army hospital. The Ninth Circuit initially allowed the suit, but reversed its decision after the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Johnson. The plaintiff alleged negligence by Army hospital personnel resulting in a stillborn child and physical/emotional injuries. The panel's first decision in Atkinson stated that the Feres doctrine only bars suits that second-guess military decisions or impact military discipline. In Atkinson v. United States, the court emphasized that military malpractice suits should be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than a blanket immunity under the Feres doctrine. The court highlighted the lack of military involvement in the plaintiff's medical treatment, stating that there was no connection to military decision-making or discipline. This decision did not exempt all military malpractice suits from the Feres doctrine, leaving room for potential situations where a connection may exist. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Johnson that the Feres doctrine applies to military personnel injured incident to service, even in cases involving torts committed by civilian agency employees. The court reaffirmed the reasons for the Feres doctrine, stating that whether the tortfeasor was a civilian or military employee was not significant. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing against the application of the Feres doctrine in such cases. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Feres doctrine in United States v. Johnson, stating that it applies to military personnel injured incident to service, even in cases involving torts by civilian agency employees. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing against the doctrine's application in such cases. The Feres doctrine was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Johnson, applying to military personnel injured incident to service. In Del Rio v. United States, a servicewoman's medical malpractice suit under the FTCA was barred by the Feres doctrine. In Irvin v. United States, another servicewoman's claim of negligent prenatal care was denied. In Bowers v. United States, the court held that the Feres doctrine prevents individuals from suing for medical malpractice during pre-induction physicals, even if they were not service members at the time. The court found that the federal relationship and impact on military decisions were key factors in upholding the doctrine with no exceptions for medical malpractice cases. The Feres doctrine, which prevents individuals from suing for medical malpractice cases related to military service, may see changes in the future due to potential actions by the Supreme Court or Congress. Some Members of Congress have shown interest in amending the doctrine to allow for medical malpractice suits. The doctrine has been applied to bar suits against the United States under various statutes, including the Privacy Act. The Feres doctrine may undergo changes regarding medical malpractice suits related to military service. The Carmelo Rodriguez Military Medical Accountability Act of 2009 was introduced in the 111th Congress to allow claims by armed forces members for injuries from improper medical care. The discretionary function exception in the FTCA immunizes the United States from claims based on discretionary functions. The discretionary function exception in the FTCA protects federal employees from liability for negligence in carrying out discretionary duties, as established in Dalehite v. United States and United States v. Varig Airlines. This exception covers decisions made by executives or administrators in setting plans or operations, and extends to acts of subordinates following official directions. The FAA implemented a \"spot-checking\" program to ensure manufacturers' compliance with safety standards. The Supreme Court ruled that judicial intervention in this decision-making process would require courts to second-guess agency judgments. FAA employees conducting compliance reviews were protected under the discretionary function exception. In Berkovitz v. United States, it was established that the government could be held liable for negligence if federal employees failed to fulfill their duties. In Berkovitz v. United States, the Supreme Court held that the government could be held liable under the FTCA for negligence when federal employees failed to follow regulations in licensing and approving a vaccine. The regulatory scheme required thorough examination of data and product compliance with safety standards before issuing a license. The regulatory scheme governing release of vaccine lots required thorough examination of data and product compliance with safety standards. The agency allegedly adopted a policy of testing all vaccine lots for compliance and preventing distribution of non-compliant lots. If proven, the discretionary function exception would not bar the claim, as operational level acts and omissions were not exempt. In United States v. Gaubert, the Court held that the discretionary function exception barred suit against the United States for the activities of federal bank regulators in connection with a failing savings and loan association. The regulators became involved in day-to-day business operations, advising on financial matters, mediating disputes, and actively intervening in regulatory matters. The plaintiff alleged negligence in these activities, resulting in $100 million in damages. The plaintiff, chairman of IASA and its largest shareholder, claimed negligence by federal bank regulators cost him $100 million in damages. The court ruled that the discretionary function exception applied to both policy and operational decisions, protecting the regulators from liability. The intentional tort exception under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) excludes certain claims from the FTCA, but the United States can still be held liable for specific torts committed by federal law enforcement officers. This exception was enacted in 1974 due to abusive incidents involving federal narcotics agents. In Sheridan v. United States, naval corpsmen encountered a naval enlisted man named Carr who displayed a rifle after regaining consciousness from alcohol consumption. In Sheridan v. United States, naval corpsmen encountered Carr, who regained consciousness, displayed a rifle, and later shot at passing vehicles. The plaintiffs sued the government for negligence in failing to alert authorities about Carr's threat. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that the intentional tort exception should only apply to claims authorized by the basic waiver of sovereign immunity. The tortious conduct of an off-duty serviceman does not automatically give rise to the exception. The intentional tort exception under the FTCA does not apply to claims authorized by the basic waiver of sovereign immunity. The government is only liable for torts committed by an employee within the scope of their office or employment. Therefore, the government could not be held liable for the acts of Carr, whether negligent or intentional, and the intentional tort exception did not bar a suit based on the negligence of others that led to Carr's actions. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether negligent hiring, supervision, or training could lead to liability under the FTCA for foreseeable assault or battery by a Government employee. There was a split in federal circuits on this question. Justice Kennedy expressed concern that intentional torts by Government employees could be attributed to negligence of supervisors. In Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., the Court established a \"government contractor defense\" in certain cases involving design defects in products liability cases under state law. The Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" in cases involving design defects in products liability under state law. This defense allows manufacturers to assert that they followed government contract specifications, protecting them from liability that could impact government contracts. The Court emphasized the need to avoid conflicts between federal policy and state law. The government contractor defense allows manufacturers to avoid liability for design defects by following government contract specifications, preventing conflicts between federal policy and state law. In cases where state-imposed duty of care conflicts with federal contracts, the defense may not be available. The Fourth Circuit reasoned that contractor liability would conflict with the Feres doctrine, as it would increase the cost of the contract and defeat the purpose of government immunity for military accidents. The Supreme Court did not adopt the Feres doctrine for the government contractor defense, as it only covers service-related injuries and not injuries caused by the military to civilians. Instead, the Court found that the discretionary function exception provided a better basis for the defense. The Supreme Court found that the discretionary function exception provided a better basis for the government contractor defense. State law holding contractors liable for design defects in military equipment can conflict with federal policy and must be displaced in certain circumstances. Liability cannot be imposed when the United States approved precise specifications, the equipment met those specifications, and the supplier warned about known dangers. The government contractor defense relies on three conditions: precise specifications, equipment conformity, and supplier warnings about known dangers. This defense applies to both civilian and military contractors, as seen in Nielson v. George Diamond Vogel Paint Co. The government contractor defense applies to both civilian and military contractors, with a focus on military considerations. There is a split in the circuits regarding its applicability to non-military contractors. In Hercules, Inc. v. United States, the Supreme Court rejected a claim by Agent Orange manufacturers for reimbursement from the government for tort claims. The manufacturers of Agent Orange sued the United States under the Tucker Act for reimbursement of tort claims brought by Vietnam veterans. The Court ruled that there was no contract with the government for reimbursement, and the government's warranty of specifications did not cover third-party claims. Numerous personnel involved in atomic weapons tests from 1946 to 1962 claim to have suffered long-term medical injuries. Many military and civilian personnel who participated in atomic weapons tests from 1946 to 1962 claim to have suffered cancer and other long-term medical injuries. Federal law generally precludes personnel from recovering in tort against the government or contractors involved. The Feres doctrine bars military personnel from recovering against the United States, while spouses and children face limitations in seeking damages for injuries related to a serviceman's service-connected injury. Courts of appeals have held that the Feres doctrine bars spouses and children of soldiers from recovering for injuries related to the soldiers' service-connected injuries, such as those caused by exposure to radiation. However, the doctrine does not prevent veterans from suing the government for post-service negligence, like failure to warn or monitor for radiation exposure. Civilians have also been denied recovery for injuries from atomic testing under the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The discretionary function exception to the FTCA applies to all plaintiffs, including military personnel in atomic testing cases. The Supreme Court has not addressed this exception in such cases but has upheld decisions barring recovery based on it. In cases like In re Consolidated United States Atmospheric Testing Litigation, negligence in following safety guidelines established in detailed Operation and Safety Plans was argued to have resulted in harm. The Ninth Circuit held that failure to follow safety guidelines during atomic testing resulted in overexposure of test participants. The court ruled that safety decisions were part of policy decisions and fell under discretionary function exception. Plaintiffs argued government negligence for not warning about radiation exposure risks. The court ruled that the decision not to issue warnings about radiation exposure risks during atomic testing fell under the discretionary function exception. This decision required difficult judgments balancing the risks of radiation exposure against the potential consequences of creating public anxiety and health hazards. The court concluded that every aspect of a warning program in this case involved discretionary policy decisions. In Allen v. United States, the court found that the government's failure to fully monitor offsite fallout exposure and provide public information on radioactive fallout fell under the discretionary function exception. The court determined that these activities involved broad discretionary policy judgments and did not clearly contravene specific statutory or regulatory authority. In Allen v. United States, the court found that the government's failure to fully monitor offsite fallout exposure and provide public information on radioactive fallout fell under the discretionary function exception. The plaintiffs' case against the government contractors involved in atomic testing was based on the argument that better plans could have been made, but this was deemed insufficient for FTCA liability. Federal law prohibits victims of atomic testing from suing government contractors, with the \"Warner Amendment\" providing that FTCA actions are the exclusive remedy for injuries due to radiation exposure. The \"Warner Amendment\" states that FTCA actions are the only remedy for injuries from radiation exposure due to atomic testing by government contractors. However, the Feres doctrine and discretionary function exception limit recovery for military personnel and others. The constitutionality of the Warner Amendment has been upheld, and its repeal would not automatically result in contractor liability. In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a compensation program for victims of atomic testing and uranium mining. It provides monetary compensation for individuals who contracted certain cancers or diseases due to radiation exposure. Accepting compensation under the act forfeits the right to sue the United States or federal contractors for related claims. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 provides compensation for victims of atomic testing and uranium mining. Accepting compensation under the act forfeits the right to sue the United States or federal contractors for related claims. Federal employees may be immune from liability for constitutional torts under certain circumstances. The Supreme Court held that federal officials can be held liable for constitutional torts under Bivens, allowing injured parties to recover damages. However, there may be limitations when \"special factors counselling hesitation\" are present, as seen in the case of Chappell v. Wallace. The Supreme Court in Chappell v. Wallace held that enlisted military personnel cannot sue their superior officers for constitutional torts under Bivens due to the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment. In United States v. Stanley, the Court applied this ruling to a case where a serviceman was given LSD without his knowledge, leading to severe consequences. The plaintiff's attempt to distinguish his case from Chappell was unsuccessful as the chain-of-command concerns were still applicable. The Court found that the injury was not \"incident to service\" and the chain-of-command concerns in Chappell are not directly implicated. The Court stated that the officer-subordinate relationship is not crucial, and military concerns should be protected in Bivens suits as they are in FTCA suits. The Feres doctrine applies equally to preclude military personnel from suing the government under the FTCA or federal officials under Bivens. Bivens-type actions are not permitted when Congress has provided an alternative remedy viewed as equally effective. In Carlson v. Green, a Bivens-type action was allowed against a federal prison official for violating the Eighth Amendment. The Court held that Congress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel causes of action, with limitations on Bivens actions. Bivens actions cannot be brought against federal agencies or private entities acting under federal law. The purpose of Bivens is to deter misconduct. The Supreme Court explained in Wilkie v. Robbins that the decision to recognize a Bivens remedy may involve two steps. Firstly, considering if there is an existing process for protecting a constitutionally recognized interest that would deter the need for a new remedy. Secondly, even without an alternative, the courts must carefully consider authorizing a new type of federal litigation. In Wilkie v. Robbins, the Supreme Court declined to allow a Bivens action for damages sought from officials of the Bureau of Land Management, citing difficulties in identifying illegitimate pressure and the potential for a flood of Bivens actions. The Court also clarified that Bivens liability cannot be established solely on a theory of respondeat superior, emphasizing that federal officials cannot be held liable for their subordinates' wrongdoing. The Bivens doctrine allows for individual liability for constitutional violations, but in practice, the federal government often pays for representation and settlements. Data shows that very few Bivens claims result in successful judgments or settlements, with plaintiffs rarely receiving damages. Federal employees have limited immunity from liability for constitutional torts under the FTCA, with qualified immunity being a significant barrier to constitutional tort actions. In Butz v. Economou, the Supreme Court ruled that federal executive officials are entitled to qualified immunity, except in cases where absolute immunity is necessary for public business. State executive officers are also immune from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, depending on the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office. Qualified immunity is granted to executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct, based on reasonable grounds and good-faith belief at the time. Federal officials may be liable for violating constitutional rights, even if the FTCA's discretionary function exception would preclude government liability. Congress has the power to grant additional immunity to federal officials."
