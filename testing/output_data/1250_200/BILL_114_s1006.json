    "content": "The \"Positive Train Control Safety Act\" includes provisions such as implementation deadlines, transparency, positive train control on high-hazard flammable trains, spectrum coordination, confidential close call reporting systems, commuter rail track inspections, and a study on the effectiveness of positive train control at grade crossings. The Positive Train Control Safety Act allows for deadline extensions for implementation under certain circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, such as funding availability and technology constraints. The Positive Train Control Safety Act allows for deadline extensions for implementation under certain circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, such as funding availability and technology constraints. The applicant must present a revised positive train control implementation plan by December 31, 2018, taking into consideration areas of greater risk and operational failure. The Secretary must review and approve or disapprove the application within 120 days of receiving it. The Secretary may extend the implementation deadline for an applicant whose application is under review, but not beyond June 30, 2016. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY. Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation on the status of their positive train control system plans. Reports must be submitted every year until system certification by the Secretary. The amended Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code now mandates progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation on their positive train control system plans. The reports must include details on the train control components installed, remaining to be installed, employee training requirements, training status, estimated completion date, and challenges to full system implementation. The amended Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code now requires progress reports from railroad carriers and entities on their positive train control system plans. The reports must detail installed components, remaining challenges, and be made public within 30 days of receipt. SEC. 4. POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL ON HIGH-HAZARD FLAMMABLE TRAINS. Amends Section 20157(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code to require positive train control on main lines with 20 or more tank cars of flammable materials. SEC. 5. COORDINATION OF SPECTRUM. Amends Subchapter II of chapter 201 of title 49, United States Code to assess spectrum needs for positive train control systems in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission. SEC. 6. CONFIDENTIAL CLOSE CALL REPORTING SYSTEMS. The Positive Train Control Safety Act mandates the Secretary to establish regulations for confidential close call reporting systems within a year of enactment. The program aims to protect railroad carrier employees from enforcement actions and utilize third parties for data collection and distribution. Program development and oversight must be in place within 180 days of final regulations. Within 180 days of final regulations, railroad carriers must develop and submit a confidential close call reporting system program to the Secretary for approval. The program proposal should outline core principles, stakeholder roles, concerns, and operational details. The Secretary will review and approve or disapprove each program promptly, providing feedback on areas for improvement if necessary. Within 2 years of the Positive Train Control Safety Act enactment, railroad carriers must establish a confidential close call reporting system. The Secretary will conduct annual reviews to ensure compliance with approved programs. Railroad carriers must correct deficiencies promptly and update their programs as needed with Secretary's approval before making major changes. Each applicable railroad carrier must provide a safe environment for employees to report unsafe events and conditions within a confidential close call reporting system. They are required to protect employees from discipline for reporting such events, implement corrective actions based on the information collected, and use the data to identify safety issues and emerging risks. Railroad carriers must consult and reach agreement with directly affected employees on program development. Railroad carriers must consult with directly affected employees, including labor organizations, on the development and implementation of safety programs. If consensus is not reached, employees and organizations can submit statements to the Secretary for consideration. Non-applicable carriers can voluntarily establish safety programs under the same regulations. The section outlines the use of confidential close call reporting data by the Secretary for various purposes, defines the term 'applicable railroad carrier', and authorizes appropriations for the implementation of the program. The text amends the table of sections for chapter 201 of title 49, United States Code to support the implementation of confidential close call reporting system programs nationwide. SEC. 7. COMMUTER RAIL TRACK INSPECTIONS. Sec. 7 introduces regulations for commuter rail track inspections, requiring railroad carriers on high density commuter railroad lines to inspect main lines and sidings regularly by vehicle or on foot. This does not limit the Secretary's authority to issue regulations or orders. SEC. 8. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the effectiveness of positive train control in reducing collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. Funding is authorized for this study.\n\nSEC. 9. Within a year of the Positive Train Control Safety Act, the Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations requiring redundant signal protection for maintenance-of-way work crews on high density commuter railroad lines."
