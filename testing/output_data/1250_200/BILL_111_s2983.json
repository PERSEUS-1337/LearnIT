A qualified employer is defined as any employer other than the United States, any State, any local government, or any instrumentality of the foregoing. The term 'qualified employer' refers to any employer other than the United States, any State, any local government, or any instrumentality of the foregoing. A 'qualified individual' is someone who starts working for a qualified employer between February 3, 2010, and January 1, 2011, certifies they have not worked more than 40 hours in the 60 days before starting, is not replacing another employee unless they left voluntarily or for cause, and is not described in section 51(i)(1) with 'qualified employer' substituted for 'taxpayer'. The provision allows qualified employers to elect not to have certain subsections apply, and excludes wages paid to qualified individuals from the payroll tax forgiveness unless the employer makes an election. Appropriations are made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Appropriations are made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to offset revenue reductions caused by amendments.

The credit increases the current year business credit by $1,000 for each retained worker who meets specific criteria. A retained worker is defined as a qualified individual employed by the taxpayer for at least 52 consecutive weeks, with wages meeting certain requirements."
