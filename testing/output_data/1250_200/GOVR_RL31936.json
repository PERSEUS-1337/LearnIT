    "content": "The report provides a history and analysis of general revenue sharing (GRS), a federal program that provided grants to state and local governments without specific spending requirements. The program was implemented in 1972 and expired in 1986. Congress considered reviving GRS in 2003 and 2004 to address state budget shortfalls. Observers suggest a new GRS program in 2009 could prevent spending cuts and tax increases. Budget gaps were estimated at $31.0 billion for FY2009 and $64.7 billion for FY2010. Examining the past GRS program could offer insights for policymakers considering a revised program in 2009. The report discusses the history and economic rationale of general revenue sharing (GRS) as authorized by the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972. It analyzes the potential use of GRS for stimulating the economy in 2009 and provides a detailed legislative history of the program. GRS involves unconditional federal grants to state and local governments for spending flexibility, with a fixed annual grant amount allocated by formula. The original GRS program from 1972 to 1986 transferred over $83 billion to state governments. The GRS program from 1972 to 1986 transferred over $83 billion to state and local governments. To achieve a comparable magnitude of assistance today, approximately $313 billion would need to be distributed over the next 15 years. GRS allocations were determined by a formula based on tax effort, population, and per capita income. The GRS program distributed over $83 billion to state and local governments from 1972 to 1986. Allocations were determined by a formula using tax effort, population, and per capita income. The formula adjusted state allocations based on ability-to-pay and tax structure. The GRS program distributed over $83 billion to state and local governments from 1972 to 1986 based on a formula that considered tax effort, population, and per capita income. The formula included the Relative Income Factor (RIF) and the Gross Tax Effort Factor (GTEF) to adjust state allocations. The GTEF component disincentivized states from reducing taxes and relying more on federal revenue. The allocation procedure involved calculating each state's share based on the formula, with one-third going to the state government and two-thirds to local general purpose governments within the state. The GRS program distributed over $83 billion to state and local governments from 1972 to 1986 based on a formula that considered tax effort, population, and per capita income. The allocation formula was criticized for generating inequitable treatment of local governments, with similar governments receiving different revenue sharing payments due to geographic location. The inequities were primarily created by tiering allocation procedures. The GRS program distributed over $83 billion to state and local governments from 1972 to 1986. Proponents and opponents of GRS modified their arguments based on changing political and economic conditions. Three economic rationales behind GRS include fiscal reallocation, addressing government liquidity crises, and synchronizing federal and state-local fiscal policy. Fiscal reallocation involves replacing state and local tax regimes with federal taxes and aligning federal spending objectives with state and local priorities. The GRS program distributed over $83 billion to state and local governments from 1972 to 1986. Proponents of reallocating funds through GRS argue for a more progressive tax structure at the federal level. However, the effectiveness of GRS in achieving this objective is uncertain, as it would shift spending decisions to state and local governments. While some believe that state and local governments are better equipped to meet resident preferences, the overall efficiency gains of a GRS program on a national scale are questionable. The arguments for and against fiscal reallocation through a GRS program are subjective, as they revolve around fairness in the tax system. State and local governments often face fiscal liquidity issues due to revenue fluctuations during economic slowdowns, leading to budget deficits. The impact of fiscal reallocation on government fiscal relationships and the desirability of such a shift are not analyzed in this report. State and local governments face budget deficits during economic slowdowns, unable to use debt to close gaps like the federal government. A countercyclical GRS program could help with short-term liquidity issues. Opponents argue that poor fiscal management leads to deficits, but research shows state budgets are asymmetric over the business cycle, saving less during expansions. Political pressure to reduce taxes during surpluses is a common reason for this. State and local governments tend to save less during expansions due to political pressure to reduce taxes when budget surpluses accrue. The federal government employs countercyclical fiscal policy to stabilize consumption patterns and the price level during economic cycles. This policy involves tax reductions or increased government spending to stimulate demand for goods and services, leading to economic expansion and recovery. However, state and local governments may counteract federal fiscal policy by raising taxes and reducing expenditures during recessions, creating a \"pro-cyclical\" effect. During economic downturns, state and local governments may undermine federal fiscal stimulus by raising taxes and cutting expenditures, creating a \"pro-cyclical\" effect. The 1976 debate on general revenue sharing highlighted this issue, with Senator Muskie arguing that while the federal government was cutting taxes to boost economic recovery, state and local governments were being forced to raise taxes, delaying the impact of federal efforts. The current economic situation is compared to the 1973-1975 recession, which was deeper and longer with an oil supply shock. The debate on countercyclical aid to states today echoes the 1975-1976 debate. The potential impact of implementing general revenue sharing in 2009 is analyzed. The analysis focuses on the potential economic impact of implementing General Revenue Sharing (GRS) in 2009. It discusses the size of GRS compared to state deficits, implementation issues, and the question of whether state actions without federal assistance would dampen the effect of federal fiscal policy. Despite remaining state budget gaps in FY2009, closing them with revenue sharing would likely have little effect on the national economy. The National Conference of State Legislatures reported a $31.0 billion gap for 38 states in FY2009, which is a small percentage of the U.S. GDP. However, projected shortfalls for FY2010 are higher, indicating a potential need for GRS grants. The potential economic impact of implementing General Revenue Sharing (GRS) in 2009 is discussed. A one-time GRS grant to states could provide significant fiscal stimulus, assuming states spend the federal grants immediately. Research shows that not all of the grant would translate into new spending due to leakage theory. Federal spending flowing seamlessly through states to designated programs is assumed, but two factors may affect this flow. The discussion focuses on potential time lags in implementing fiscal stimulus through General Revenue Sharing (GRS) grants. Time lags in implementation can hinder the effectiveness of fiscal policy during a recession, potentially leading to mistimed actions and pro-cyclical effects. Policy makers should exercise caution in using fiscal stimulus to avoid inflationary pressures. The potential time lags in implementing fiscal stimulus through General Revenue Sharing (GRS) grants can hinder the effectiveness of fiscal policy during a recession. At the federal level, policy makers must agree on the need for stimulus, its size, and a grant allocation scheme. This process can lead to delays in implementation. At the state level, federal grants arriving before June 30, 2009, could prevent pro-cyclical state actions like budget cuts and tax increases. If the grants arrive too late, state budget officials may struggle to incorporate this revenue effectively. Unconditional revenue sharing grants can help states avert pro-cyclical actions like budget cuts and tax increases. States have options for federal grants: increase spending, reduce taxes, reduce debt, or contribute to a rainy day fund. Increased spending is the most stimulative in the short run, injecting money into the economy immediately. This can help retain state employees, maintain operations, and prevent scaling back social programs like education and healthcare. The fiscal stimulus is most effective when government spending is quickly multiplied through the economy, known as the \"multiplier effect.\" To achieve the greatest stimulus, states should avoid contractionary actions like layoffs and furloughs. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) categorized state spending strategies for FY2009 to reduce budget gaps. For FY2010, some states may increase taxes to close budget gaps. Avoiding job losses would provide the most relative stimulus for each dollar spent. Avoiding net job losses would provide the most relative stimulus for each dollar spent. Layoffs reduce aggregate demand and government services, leading to direct reductions in economic activity. Preventing job losses could avoid negative effects on the economy and enhance the stimulative effect. Preventing job losses could enhance the stimulative effect on the economy by avoiding negative effects. Saving behavior of separated employees could further boost this effect, especially for low-income workers. Across-the-board cuts and local government aid also play a role in economic stimulus, with varying impacts across states. Tax cuts are generally less effective in stimulating the economy. The stimulative effect of avoiding cuts in local aid and tax increases is uncertain. Tax cuts are less stimulative than direct spending increases. Debt reduction and contributing to a rainy day fund offer little stimulus. The combined effect of state and local government responses to federal grants is difficult to quantify. The State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 authorized unconditional GRS grants for state and local governments, with specific allowable expenditures including public safety, environmental protection, public transportation, health, recreation, libraries, social services, and financial administration. Education was excluded from the list of acceptable uses for the grants. The 1972 State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act authorized unconditional GRS grants for state and local governments for various purposes such as public safety, environmental protection, public transportation, health, recreation, libraries, social services for the poor or aged, and financial administration. The grants could not be used for education. The 1976 extension discontinued the priority expenditure list and allowed for \"ordinary and necessary capital expenditures.\" Congress believed GRS was necessary due to changing citizen demands for government services and the increasing costs of public services. The Nixon Administration signed the legislation for the GRS program to address the increasing demand for public services and the difficulty in raising necessary revenue. The program aimed to decentralize government, stabilize or reduce state and local taxes, equalize fiscal conditions, and shift reliance to income taxation. The 1972 State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act authorized unconditional GRS grants for various purposes excluding education, with the 1976 extension allowing for capital expenditures. The 1976 Extension of the GRS program extended it through FY1980 with minor modifications. Reasons for the extension included rising service costs, declining tax bases, and the elastic demand for public services by state and local governments. The 1976 extension of the GRS program aimed to address rising service costs and declining tax bases for state and local governments. It eliminated spending restrictions and prioritized flexibility in fund usage. The $25.5 billion extension aimed to stabilize the economy and restructure intergovernmental transfers, with potential countercyclical benefits. The 1980 Extension of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments (P.L. 96-604) extended the general revenue sharing program through September 30, 1983, but only for local governments. The state share was eliminated to help balance the Federal budget, reducing GRS grants by one-third to $4.567 billion for local governments only. The 1980 Act extended the general revenue sharing program for local governments until 1983 and introduced a countercyclical assistance program to provide aid during recessions. The program allocated $1 billion for fiscal years 1981-1983, triggered by economic downturns based on specific criteria. Funding was tied to declines in real gross national product and wages, with funds allocated based on the severity of the recession. The program aimed to provide assistance to state and local governments during economic downturns. The 1980 Act introduced a countercyclical assistance program to provide aid during recessions, allocating $1 billion for fiscal years 1981-1983. The program aimed to provide assistance to state and local governments based on declines in real gross national product and wages. However, no grants were provided under this program as the trigger threshold was never crossed. The 1980 Act introduced a countercyclical assistance program to aid state and local governments during recessions, but no grants were provided as the trigger threshold was never crossed. The program aimed to provide assistance based on declines in real GNP and wages. The GRS legislation provided $13.7 billion in grants to local governments, representing 2.3% of total own-source revenue. However, these grants had little effect on the national economy, amounting to only 0.14% of U.S. GDP over the three-year period. The $1 billion allocated for countercyclical aid for 1981-1983 was never spent and would have had a negligible impact on the economy even if fully utilized. The 1983 Extension of the GRS program aimed to stabilize the fiscal condition of local governments by providing $13.7 billion in grants over three years. This extension was intended to help local governments meet the needs of their communities during fiscal stringency. The program ended on September 30, 1986, without extending the countercyclical aid program."
