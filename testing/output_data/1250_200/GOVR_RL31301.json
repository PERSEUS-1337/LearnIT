    "content": "The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7, H.J.Res. 2) signed into law by the President includes $74.25 billion in funding for USDA and related agencies, with $17.545 billion for discretionary programs. An additional $3.1 billion is allocated for supplemental disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters in 2001 or 2002. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates through 30 internal agencies with 100,000 employees, and its FY2002 gross outlays were $79.95 billion, with food and nutrition programs accounting for 50% of spending. In FY2002, USDA spending totaled $79.95 billion, with 50% allocated to food and nutrition programs, including the food stamp program, child nutrition programs, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. The second largest spending area was for farm and foreign agricultural services, totaling $22.9 billion. Additionally, $7.0 billion was allocated for natural resource and environment programs, with a focus on the Forest Service. Rural development programs received $2.72 billion in gross outlays for FY2002. USDA spending in FY2002 totaled $79.95 billion, with key areas including food and nutrition programs, farm and foreign agricultural services, natural resource and environment programs, and rural development. Approximately three-fourths of USDA spending is classified as mandatory, with programs like farm commodity support, food stamps, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation receiving funding. The USDA budget in FY2002 totaled $79.95 billion, with three-fourths classified as mandatory spending. This includes funding for food stamp and child nutrition programs, commodity support programs, and other mandatory programs. The remaining 25% is for discretionary programs like Forest Service programs, rural development programs, and food inspection programs, funded through annual appropriations acts. The USDA budget in FY2002 totaled $79.95 billion, with three-fourths classified as mandatory spending for food stamp and child nutrition programs, commodity support programs, and other mandatory programs. The remaining 25% is for discretionary programs like Forest Service programs, rural development programs, and food inspection programs, funded through annual appropriations acts. Funding for USDA discretionary programs is provided by the annual agriculture appropriations act, while Forest Service programs are included in the annual Interior appropriations act. Congress controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility and benefit formulas, while discretionary programs are controlled by annual appropriations. The Bush Administration released its budget request for FY2003, requesting $74.062 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies. This amount is $814 million above the FY2002 enacted appropriation. The FY2002 enacted level includes supplemental appropriations in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Bush Administration requested nearly $500 million in supplemental appropriations for USDA, FDA, and CFTC in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The requested $17.421 billion for discretionary accounts was $1.145 billion above the FY2002 appropriation. The 107th Congress adjourned without passing the appropriations bill, and the 108th Congress considered it as part of an omnibus bill. The House Appropriations Committee completed markups of the FY2003 agriculture bill for USDA and related agencies. The total appropriations in the bill were $74.306 billion, with $17.601 billion for discretionary programs and $56.705 billion for mandatory USDA programs. The discretionary level in the House bill was $1.325 billion higher than the regular FY2002 appropriations. The full House adopted a continuing resolution to finalize funding decisions on remaining regular appropriations. The House adopted a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 2) in early January 2003 to finalize funding decisions on remaining regular appropriations bills, including agriculture. The Senate-amended version of H.J.Res. 2 was an omnibus appropriations measure that included the full-text of each outstanding regular bill. Prior to H.J.Res. 2, FY2003 spending for USDA and related agencies was governed by eight continuing resolutions. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill (S. 2801) with total funding of $74.66 billion, $354 million above the House bill. The Senate combined the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill with other bills into an omnibus package, which was adopted as an amendment to H.J.Res. 2. Funding levels for USDA in H.J.Res. 2 were similar to S. 2801, with additional funds for farm assistance and emergency famine relief in Africa. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (H.J.Res. 2) included $3.1 billion in farm assistance, $500 million for emergency famine relief in Africa, and an across-the-board reduction in discretionary programs. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 108-7 on February 20, 2003, combining 11 appropriations bills from the previous Congress. The total budget authority for USDA and related agencies was $74.25 billion, with $17.55 billion for discretionary programs and $56.70 billion for mandatory programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 108-7) included $3.1 billion in farm assistance and an across-the-board reduction in discretionary programs. The discretionary appropriation was $56 million below the House-reported level and $805 million below the Senate-passed level. The total budget authority for USDA and related agencies was $74.25 billion, with $17.55 billion for discretionary programs and $56.70 billion for mandatory programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 108-7) included funding for various mission areas and agencies within USDA, as well as for the Food and Drug Administration. Most spending for USDA's mandatory agriculture and conservation programs is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which has the legal authority to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury. This report will continue to track congressional action on FY2003 agriculture appropriations. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds ongoing farm programs, emergency spending, and disaster payments. It must repay borrowed funds but relies on congressional appropriations to replenish losses and maintain borrowing authority. The CCC receives an indefinite appropriation due to difficulty in estimating funding needs. The CCC has received an indefinite appropriation in recent years to cover losses from crop and weather conditions. In FY2000, net outlays totaled $32 billion, exceeding the $30 billion borrowing limit. The Administration requested $16.285 billion for FY2003, with an additional $3.1 billion for farm disaster assistance. This was approved in the omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) due to severe drought conditions. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L.108-7) provides $3.1 billion in economic and disaster assistance for agricultural producers affected by severe drought in 2001 and 2002. The assistance is funded by a spending limitation on the Conservation Security Program over the next 10 years. The Administration did not request assistance and insisted on offsetting any aid with reductions in other farm spending. Major provisions include crop disaster assistance with a payment formula similar to the one used in 2000. The Commodity Credit Corporation will fully fund a disaster payment formula similar to the one used for ad-hoc 2000 crop disaster payments. Eligible producers can receive a payment equal to 50% of the relevant price for crop losses exceeding 35% in 2001 or 2002. Producers who waived insurance will receive 45% of the price. Sugar and tobacco have separate disaster payment programs. Producers must choose between a 2001 or 2002 payment, not both. The total disaster payment, crop insurance, and crop value cannot exceed 95% of the crop value. Participants must purchase crop insurance for the next two crop years. The Livestock Assistance Program under P.L. 108-7 provides $250 million for compensating livestock forage or feed losses due to natural disasters in 2001 or 2002. Producers in disaster-declared counties can choose between 2001 or 2002 losses and are eligible for the Livestock Compensation Program without date restrictions. The program is estimated to cost $100 million and is funded through Section 32 funds traditionally used for surplus commodity purchases. The LCP provision under P.L. 108-7 costs $100 million and is funded through Section 32 funds. The omnibus act requires new spending to come from the Commodity Credit Corporation and reimburses Section 32 with $250 million in CCC funds. Other assistance includes disaster payments to sugar beet producers, payments to sugarcane producers for hurricane losses, compensation for tobacco producers, and funds for Florida citrus growers affected by citrus canker. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offering free catastrophic insurance with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The federal crop insurance program offers producers the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at a subsidized rate through approved private insurance companies. The program is funded through appropriations, with discretionary funding for RMA salaries and expenses and necessary funding for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. The FY2003 appropriation for RMA salaries and expenses is $70.708 million, slightly below the House-reported level. The FY2003 appropriation for RMA salaries and expenses is $70.708 million, slightly below the House-reported level. The Administration request for the crop insurance program is $72.771 million, with mandatory expenses estimated at $2.89 billion for FY2003. The FY2003 appropriation for the crop insurance program is virtually equal to the FY2002 estimate. Annual spending on the program is difficult to predict due to weather and crop conditions. Legislative enhancements in 2000 have contributed to significant improvements in the program. The crop insurance program saw legislative enhancements in 2000, leading to higher farmer participation. The FY2003 budget proposed limiting private insurance companies' underwriting gains to 11.5% of retained premiums, but no legislative action has been taken yet. The Senate directed USDA to follow current procedures before making any risk-sharing changes. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs, with USDA overseeing program administration. Credit Corporation serves as the funding mechanism for farm income support and disaster assistance programs, with administration handled by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). FSA also manages commodity support programs, farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $976.7 million for FSA salaries and expenses, with an additional $70 million authorized from the Commodity Credit Corporation for farm disaster implementation costs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $976.7 million for FSA salaries and expenses, with an additional $70 million authorized from the Commodity Credit Corporation for farm disaster implementation costs. The requested increase in funding is mainly due to increased pay costs and lack of carryover funds from the previous year. The funding level for FY2003 does not include any new activities associated with the 2002 farm bill. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) provides $50 million in new mandatory funding for FSA salaries and expenses. FSA farm loan programs serve as a lender of last resort for family farmers, offering direct loans and guarantees for timely repayment. Some loans have subsidized interest rates, with an annual appropriation made to cover federal loan costs. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $228.3 million to subsidize direct and guaranteed farm loans of $3.937 billion for FY2003. This funding level allows FSA to offer nearly double the amount of direct operating loans compared to FY2002. Supplemental funding has been provided in recent years for federal farm loans in response to low farm commodity prices, limiting farmers' ability to secure commercial farm loans. USDA's agricultural trade and food aid activities include programs funded by appropriations and borrowing authority of the CCC. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) mainly addresses programs requiring appropriations, while CCC-funded activities are primarily addressed in budget proposals. The program level for USDA's international activities was about $6.1 billion for FY2003, reflecting increased spending for food aid. The program level for USDA's international activities was estimated at about $5.5 billion in FY2002, with increased spending for food aid. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers USDA's international programs, including P.L. 480 Food for Peace. P.L. 108-7 provides $129.9 million for FAS salaries and expenses, slightly less than requested. P.L. 480 food aid accounts for $1.343 billion out of an appropriation. The enacted amount for USDA's international activities in FY2002 was about $5.5 billion, with increased spending on food aid. P.L. 108-7 provides $1.477 billion for discretionary agricultural trade programs, with $1.2 billion authorized for humanitarian commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II. An additional $250 million was allocated for emergency relief activities under P.L. 480. Total appropriated international programs increased by $344 million from FY2002, mainly for humanitarian food donations in response to urgent food needs. The Administration's decision to phase out food aid based on commodity surpluses has led to an increase in food aid appropriations in response to urgent global food needs. Proposed reductions in surplus commodity programs are recommended, with a shift towards private voluntary organizations for food aid distribution. The FY2003 budget proposes an increase in P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations to offset the phase-out of certain programs. The Administration recommended increasing P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations in the FY2003 budget to compensate for the phase-out of Section 416(b) donations. Initial proposals excluded CCC funding for Food for Progress (FFP), which provides commodities to developing countries. The FFP program was reauthorized in the 2002 farm bill, complicating efforts to phase out CCC-funded food aid programs. P.L. 108-7 amended the FFP statute, requiring a minimum volume of commodities and agreements with various organizations. The President's FY2003 estimates include $158 million of CCC funding for Food for Progress (FFP) agreements with various organizations. The use of commodity surpluses for U.S. food aid has been criticized by trading partners for circumventing WTO export subsidy reduction commitments. The budget assumes $118 million for Section 416(b) programming in FY2003, mainly surplus nonfat dry milk. In FY2003, $118 million will be available for programming under Section 416(b), consisting mainly of surplus nonfat dry milk. Additionally, USDA international programs funded through CCC borrowing authority include $4.225 billion for export credit guarantees. U.S. export credit programs have been a topic of discussion in WTO agricultural trade negotiations. The EU and other trading partners criticize the U.S. export credit programs for giving unfair advantages in exporting agricultural commodities. Negotiations in the OECD were unsuccessful, and changes to the programs face strong congressional support. CCC-funded programs like MAP and FMDP aim to develop overseas markets for U.S. agricultural products. Spending for these programs is authorized in the 2002 farm bill. The EEP program has a spending limit of $28 million, reduced from the authorized level in the farm bill. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) spending is limited to $28 million, resulting in savings of $450 million from the authorized level in the farm bill. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is expected to receive $57 million, and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) has $100 million allocated for FY2002, with additional funding in subsequent years. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) received $100 million for FY2002 and additional funding in subsequent fiscal years. The program began as a pilot project during the Clinton Administration and is financed by CCC funds. The Administration plans to expend $100 million on IFED in FY2003. For more information on agricultural trade and food aid, refer to CRS Issue Briefs IB98006 and IB10077. The natural resources and environment mission area within USDA is implemented through various programs. Conservation spending includes discretionary and mandatory funding, with over $1 billion in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act. Funding for the Forest Service is provided in the annual Interior appropriations bill. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides over $1 billion in discretionary conservation spending within USDA. Mandatory conservation funding, estimated at almost $3.0 billion, includes $1 billion in new spending authorized by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171). The CBO estimated an 80% growth in overall mandatory conservation funding by FY2007. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides over $1 billion in discretionary conservation spending within USDA. The House committee-reported bill (H.R. 5263) allocated $9 million less than the Senate-passed measure (H.J.Res. 2) and $22 million below the Administration request of $1.049 billion. The FY2003 enacted level is a decrease of $29 million from the FY2002 appropriation. The largest discretionary conservation program is Conservation Operations (CO), with P.L. 108-7 providing $825 million for CO in FY2003. This is less than the Administration request but a significant increase from the previous year. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides over $1 billion in discretionary conservation spending within USDA. The law includes 114 earmarks for CO totaling more than $110 million, with some earmarks for specific projects or activities. The largest earmark is $21.5 million for the grazing lands conservation initiative. Additionally, P.L. 108-7 allocates $110 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and $11.2 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides over $1 billion in discretionary conservation spending within USDA, including $110 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $11.2 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, and $30 million for Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The Administration proposed consolidating these programs into a $110 million Emergency Watershed Protection fund, but this was not supported by either chamber. The House recommended $110 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $11.2 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, and no funding for Emergency Watershed Protection or Watershed Rehabilitation. The Senate recommended $105 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $11.0 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, and $30 million for Watershed Rehabilitation. P.L. 108-7 includes provisions limiting spending for technical assistance and expenditures related to protecting threatened and endangered species. No funds were provided for the Emergency Conservation Program. The proposal for FY2003 funding assumed $48.7 million based on past 10 years, with $51 million provided for the RC&D Program in P.L.108-7. No funding was allocated for the Forestry Incentive Program. Technical assistance funding for mandatory programs remains limited under a cap set by the Commodity Credit Corporation charter. The Administration's FY2003 proposal to address technical assistance funding for conservation programs was strongly rejected by Congress. The disaster assistance package in P.L. 108-7 specifically prohibits the use of discretionary funds for mandatory conservation programs. The Administration's request for FY2003 did not include any increase in mandatory conservation funding levels despite the reauthorization and increased funding in the 2002 farm bill. The Administration's FY2003 request did not include anticipated reauthorizations or increases in mandatory conservation funding levels. Most mandatory conservation programs had either reached their authorized ceilings or were unfunded due to previous limitations. The $3.1 billion in agricultural disaster assistance in P.L. 108-7 offset spending on the new Conservation Security Program (CSP), limiting its funding to $3.773 billion over ten years. The CSP was intended to pay farmers for conservation practices on productive land, but its implementation was delayed to FY2003. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act, P.L. 108-7, limited funding for certain conservation programs, including the Wetlands Reserve Program, EQIP, and Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. It did not address the Conservation Reserve Program. The Conservation Security Program's funding was offset by agricultural disaster assistance, totaling $3.773 billion over ten years. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act limited funding for conservation programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program and EQIP. It did not address the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to retire environmentally sensitive land. The budget assumes $1.856 billion for existing and new CRP contracts. Other programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program and EQIP will see rapid growth in funding. For more information on USDA conservation issues, refer to CRS Issue Brief IB96030 and for farm bill conservation provisions, see CRS Report RL31486(pdf). The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $2.506 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies, slightly higher than the Senate-passed bill and significantly more than the House-reported bill. The funding is $61 million above the FY2002 level and supports agencies like the Agricultural Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, and Economic Research Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion supporting research programs and $119.5 million for modernizing facilities. This represents a $73 million increase for research programs from FY2002. Additionally, there is virtually level funding for ARS research and an increase in funds for facilities construction compared to previous measures. The Administration requested $971.4 million for ARS research and $16.6 million for construction projects for FY2003. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion for research programs and $119.5 million for facilities construction. The conference report includes language supporting the continuation of all ARS research projects and locations recommended for termination or consolidation by the Administration. Additionally, there is a provision blocking funds for a review of ARS research quality and relevance. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized the ARS study, but the final FY2003 appropriations law states that USDA should review the existing NAS study before requesting another. The FY2003 appropriations law authorized additional funding for ARS to upgrade bioterrorism research facilities. It also allocated $190 million for research on bioterrorism prevention, preparedness, and response. P.L. 108-7 provided $1.125 billion for CSREES to support research and extension programs at land grant colleges of agriculture, representing a $97 million increase from the previous year. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $1.125 billion for CSREES to support research and extension programs at land grant colleges of agriculture, with increases in funding for research and education programs, as well as extension programs. The final law provided funding for core research and extension programs at 1862 land grant institutions, forestry research, research at historically black land grant colleges, extension at 1890 colleges, and extension at 1862 institutions. Additionally, funding for Special Research grants was increased to $112.3 million, higher than the proposed termination amount of $3.3 million. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $1.125 billion for CSREES, with increases in funding for research and extension programs. Funding for Special Research grants was increased to $112.3 million. P.L.108-7 also provides $30 million for earmarked grants under the \"Federal Administration\" portion of the CSREES budget. $167.1 million was allocated for the National Research Initiative Competitive Research Grants program. The conference report retains the block on the expenditure of $120 million in mandatory funds for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The 2002 farm bill reauthorizes the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, increasing funding to $200 million annually by FY2006-07. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 provides authority for security improvements at land grant college facilities. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act does not contain appropriations under this authority. Funding for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is provided in P.L. 108-7, with $69.1 million for ERS and $139.4 million for NASS. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates funds to various agencies, including $139.4 million for NASS, slightly below the Senate's proposal but above the House's level. The act also provides $759.8 million for FSIS, higher than the House's proposal and fully funding the President's request. Additionally, FSIS will have access to an extra $101 million in user fees for inspection activities. In FY2003, FSIS will receive an additional $101 million in user fee income for inspection activities. P.L.108-7 includes $5 million to hire 50 personnel to enforce the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The omnibus appropriations act provides $868.1 million for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs, slightly below the House and Senate proposals. The omnibus appropriations act provides $868.1 million for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs, with $735.5 million allocated to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). This amount is $11.3 million lower than the FY2002 total, but represents an increase in funds for APHIS salaries and expenses over the previous year. The omnibus appropriations act provides $868.1 million for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs, with $735.5 million allocated to APHIS. There is an increase in funds for APHIS salaries and expenses over FY2002, and a $2.8 million increase for facilities renovation. The requested FY2003 appropriation for APHIS was $775.3 million, but the final amount provided was $749 million. The conferees did not include a Senate proposal to increase APHIS salaries and expenses by $17 million for stepped-up border inspections. The inspection function, equipment, Beagle Brigade, and employees have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. USDA retains control of user fees collected to repay DHS for border inspection costs. Approximately $275 million expected in FY2003. Funding increases in P.L. 108-7 for APHIS activities include surveillance against biological attacks, managing plant pests, Johne's disease, and Wildlife Services programs. $15 million allocated for chronic wasting disease management. APHIS required to expand laboratory testing. The funding in P.L. 108-7 includes $15 million for chronic wasting disease management in deer and elk, with a requirement for APHIS to expand laboratory testing capacity. The bill does not include proposals for additional funds for CWD research. The funding in P.L. 108-7 includes $86.8 million, with $15.8 million allocated for the pesticide data program. AMS manages the Section 32 program, providing funds for various farm sector activities. Concerns were raised about adequate funding for emergency commodity purchases. There were concerns about adequate funding for emergency commodity purchases, including a special livestock disaster assistance program. The Department made adjustments in USDA spending accounts to cover these activities. Additionally, a provision in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act required the transfer of $250 million from the CCC to Section 32 for emergency surplus removal of agricultural commodities. P.L. 108-7 prohibits reprogramming funds without notifying Appropriations Committees. GIPSA oversees grain standards and fair trading practices. Funding for GIPSA in FY2003 was $39.95 million, lower than proposed amounts. The Administration requested $12.2 million, down from $33 million in FY2002. User fees were proposed to cover the shortfall. The Administration proposed a $29 million increase in new user fees in FY2002 to fund Packers and Stockyards Act inspections and grain standard testing activities. However, P.L.108-7 does not assume adoption of these user fees. The final law includes a directive for a 2-year study on packer ownership of livestock. USDA's rural development mission aims to enhance rural communities by targeting resources in areas of greatest need through agencies like the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $2.795 billion for rural economic and community development programs, exceeding the Administration's budget request of $2.587 billion. This includes a loan authorization level of $12 billion for rural development loans, with additional funding for unsubsidized guaranteed housing loans and electric utility loans. The Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) is funded through consolidated funding for 12 rural field offices. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $2.795 billion for rural economic and community development programs, exceeding the Administration's budget request. The Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) consists of funding for 12 rural development loan and grant programs in three accounts. P.L. 108-7 allocates $907.7 million for the RCAP accounts, with varying amounts for Community Facilities, Rural Utilities, and Business and Cooperative Development. P.L. 108-7 allocates $87.7 million for the Rural Business Development account, with additional funding for water and waste disposal grants in the Rural Utilities account. It also earmarks funds for technical assistance grants and programs in Alaskan native villages, Federally Recognized Native American Tribes, the Delta Regional Authority, and colonias along the U.S.-Mexican border. Funding for colonias is $5 million more than proposed by the Senate. Funding for the colonias in P.L. 108-7 is $5 million more than proposed by the Senate and the same as proposed by the House. The bill also includes funding for grants to rural communities with high-energy costs and facilities in rural communities suffering from extreme unemployment and economic depression. Additionally, $7 million is designated for the Rural Community Development Initiative, with $1 million allocated to a demonstration program for Rural Cooperative Home Based Health Care. $37.6 million is designated for Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities and Rural Economic Area Partnerships Zones. The Rural Housing Service receives a total appropriation of $305.5 million for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program account. The Rural Housing Service in P.L.108-7 receives a total appropriation of $305.5 million for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program account. This supports a rural housing loan authorization level of $5.8 billion, including funding for various housing loan programs. Additionally, the bill provides $100 million for Section 538 multi-family loan guarantees and $4.5 million in loan subsidies. The budget for Section 538 multi-family housing guarantees was $100 million, matching the House proposal. P.L. 108-7 allocated $202 million for Section 502 single family housing, exceeding the budget request by $17 million. For Section 515 housing, $115 million in loan authorization was provided, almost double the budget request. Additionally, $54 million in direct loan subsidies were allocated for Section 515 rental housing. The bill also allows loans for new construction of Section 515 housing, despite the Administration's request against it. The focus is on long-term rehabilitation needs in the multi-family housing portfolio. The budget for Section 538 multi-family housing guarantees was $100 million, while P.L. 108-7 allocated $202 million for Section 502 single family housing, exceeding the budget request by $17 million. For Section 515 housing, $115 million in loan authorization was provided, almost double the budget request. The focus is on long-term rehabilitation needs in the multi-family housing portfolio. P.L. 108-7 also provides funding for Section 504 housing repairs, Section 521 rental assistance, Farm Labor Program grants, rural housing assistance grants, mutual and self-help housing grants, and rural housing loans for empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and REAP Zones. Rural Utilities Service receives a total subsidy of $12.5 million. The Agreement earmarks $11.6 million in rural housing loans for empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and REAP Zones until June 2003. It provides a total subsidy of $12.5 million for programs under the Rural Electrification and Telecommunications Loan Program. The loan authorization level is set at $5.6 billion, including $1 billion for guaranteed underwriting of credit payments. For the Rural Telephone Bank, the proposed loan level is $174.6 million. Additionally, there are loan subsidies and grants of $56.9 million for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. P.L. 108-7 provides funding for various programs including $380 million for loan authorization, $19.3 million for Rural Development Loan Fund, $9 million for Rural Cooperative Development Grants, and $15 million for EZ/EC areas. Additionally, there are no funds allocated for the Local Television Loan Guarantee program.
