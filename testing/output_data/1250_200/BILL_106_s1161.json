    "content": "The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" aims to establish a framework for enacting unilateral economic sanctions while minimizing adverse effects on US businesses. The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines terms like new unilateral economic sanctions law, new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, and unilateral economic sanction. The term \"unilateral economic sanction\" refers to measures taken by the United States to advance foreign policy or national security interests, constraining economic activities and government programs, excluding obligations under international agreements. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the US foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing sanctions if in the national interest, ensure contract sanctity unless it hinders the effectiveness of sanctions, allow the President to consider the impact on innocent parties, and not restrict certain actions. The sanctions should be narrowly targeted and not restrict humanitarian aid, agricultural exports, or activities aimed at changing the sanctioned behavior. The President must review the effectiveness of the sanctions annually and report to Congress. The evaluation of sanctions includes assessing their effectiveness, likely effectiveness, objectives, multilateral support, costs and gains to the US, and any decisions made to exercise related authorities. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. In considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should ensure complete information on costs and gains, consider international legal obligations, assess consistency with existing sanctions, and evaluate administrative costs. The costs and gains include the likelihood of each sanction's effectiveness. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should evaluate the costs and gains, including the likelihood of each sanction achieving its objective, importance to US national interests, impact on humanitarian conditions, relations with allies, and other national security interests. Diplomatic and other steps taken by the US should also be considered. When evaluating new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should consider the likelihood of achieving objectives, impact on national interests, humanitarian conditions, relations with allies, and national security interests. Additionally, the potential for multilateral adoption of similar measures and the potential harm to US interests and reputation should be assessed. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The House and Senate cannot consider new unilateral economic sanctions legislation unless it meets specific criteria. Any new sanctions legislation is considered a Federal private sector mandate and must be assessed for its impact on the US economy, trade performance, employment, growth, and international reputation. The House and Senate must adhere to specific criteria when considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation to assess its impact on the US economy, trade performance, employment, growth, and international reputation as a reliable supplier of products, agricultural commodities, technology, and services. Congress enacts this section as an exercise of its rulemaking power, recognizing the constitutional right of each House to change the rules related to its procedures. The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and establish procedures for public outreach. Rules regarding sanctions imposed by the Executive Branch or statutory enactments should also be implemented. The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions if the gains for national interests do not outweigh the costs. If sanctions are refrained from or suspended, they can be reimposed with prior notification to Congress. Congressional disapproval can be expressed for Presidential actions regarding sanctions. The President can refrain from imposing sanctions based on national interests, but Congress can disapprove within 30 days. Sanctions can be suspended or terminated with a 30-day notice to Congress, which can express disapproval through a joint resolution. Congressional procedures for disapproval are outlined in the Senate. The congressional procedures for disapproval of sanctions involve specific processes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Any joint resolution must be considered according to established provisions, and motions to proceed with the resolution are treated as highly privileged. Additionally, the provisions in this section take precedence over any other laws."
