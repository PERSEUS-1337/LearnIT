    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings of Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, and well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, self-esteem, and overall health. The increasing rates of childhood obesity and its economic impact are also addressed. The prevalence of obesity among children in the United States is a significant issue, leading to costly obesity-related diseases and a high number of deaths due to inactivity and poor diet. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Despite recommendations for daily physical education for students, little progress has been made in implementing these programs. Despite recommendations for daily physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made in providing high-quality physical education opportunities. It is essential for students to have access to quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity, promoting healthy and active lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. Goals include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive development for children. Physical education programs aim to support the physical, mental, and social development of children, including cognitive concepts, social skills, and healthy eating habits. Teachers should receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as large and small student populations. Funding applications can include home-schooled and private school students. Reports are required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving grant or contract funding. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the success of programs in improving physical fitness. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of the funds, and the federal share must supplement, not supplant, existing funds. The Federal share for project assistance is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available federal, state, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations includes $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004."
