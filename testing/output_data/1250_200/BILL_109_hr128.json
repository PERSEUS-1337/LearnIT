    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"College Fire Prevention Act\" is cited as the short title. Congress found incidents of fires at universities due to lack of fire alarms, hidden rooms causing difficulties for firefighters, and fatal fires in apartments with no sprinklers or proper smoke detectors. Several fires at universities caused significant damage and forced evacuations. In one incident, a fire at Pennsylvania State University displaced 11 students, while another fire at DePauw University caused over $1,000,000 in damage and forced the evacuation of 116 students. These incidents highlight the importance of fire safety measures such as automatic fire sprinkler systems. Several fires at universities caused significant damage and forced evacuations. On February 16, 2002, a fire started at Amherst College in a residence converted into student housing due to a halogen lamp. The building lacked an automatic fire sprinkler system and had smoke detectors and a fire alarm system. Another fire occurred on January 19, 2000, at Seton Hall University dormitory, resulting in three deaths. Three male freshmen, all 18 years old, died in a university dormitory fire. Fifty-four students, 2 firefighters, and 2 police officers were injured. The dormitory, a 6-story, 350-room structure built in 1952, housed around 600 students and lacked a fire sprinkler system. In a separate incident in 1996, a fire at a fraternity house in North Carolina killed 5 college juniors and injured 3 due to the absence of fire sprinklers. Between 1980 and 1998, an average of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities caused 1 death, 70 injuries, and $8,000,000 in property damage. Arson is the leading cause of fires in these locations. In dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, arson is the leading cause of fires, followed by cooking and smoking. New dormitories are required to have fire sprinklers, but existing buildings are rarely retrofitted with them. In 1998, most campus building fires occurred where smoke alarms were present, but only a third had fire sprinklers. Establishment of Fire Suppression Demonstration Incentive Program. The Secretary of Education will establish a program to award grants for installing fire suppression technologies in student housing owned by eligible entities, including accredited institutions of higher education and historically Black colleges. The Secretary of Education will prioritize grants for fire suppression technologies in student housing based on financial need. A portion of the grants will be reserved for historically Black colleges, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges, and social fraternities and sororities. To apply for a grant under this section, eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Applicants must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 50% of the activity costs. No more than 10% of the grant can be used for administrative expenses. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the number and types of entities receiving assistance. The report will detail the number and types of eligible entities receiving assistance, the amounts of assistance and non-Federal funding leveraged, student housing with fire suppression technologies, types and costs of technologies, barriers to technology development, and any other relevant information for evaluating the program's effectiveness in improving fire safety in student housing. The program's effectiveness in improving fire safety in student housing will be evaluated by detailing the assistance provided, funding leveraged, and technologies used. $100,000,000 is authorized annually for the program, with unobligated funds reverting to the Treasury after fiscal year 2009. SEC. 3. ADMISSIBILITY AS EVIDENCE. Any application for assistance under this Act, negative determinations by the Secretary, or reasons for such determinations cannot be used as evidence in any legal proceedings, except in cases related to agreements with eligible entities under section 2."
