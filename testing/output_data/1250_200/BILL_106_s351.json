    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Taxpayer Oversight of Surplus Property Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act established a system for fair allocation of surplus property to various recipients. The benefits of the program save taxpayer dollars by repurposing property. Oversight by officials ensures accountability to taxpayers, as surplus property belongs to the American people. State agencies have successfully distributed surplus property to benefit taxpayers. The State agencies have distributed surplus property to benefit American taxpayers, including items like office equipment, clothing, furniture, vehicles, aircraft, boats, and generators. However, the current system is hindered by prioritizing foreign entities over the needs of American taxpayers. New legislation is needed to prioritize domestic transfers of excess property to Federal agencies over foreign assistance programs. The legislation aims to prioritize states and local organizations for the transfer of nonlethal excess supplies from the Department of Defense. Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code is amended to allow nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense to be made available to states or local governments before humanitarian relief purposes. The term 'State' includes states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. possession. SEC. 4 amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to allow property transfers for environmental protection in foreign countries. It specifies conditions for property transfers and prohibits transfer restrictions. SEC. 5 requires a report on surplus personal property disposal and donation. The Administrator of General Services must review statutes on surplus personal property disposal and donation within 180 days of this Act's enactment. A report to Congress should assess program effectiveness, property amounts, and types administered in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Legislative recommendations for integrating and consolidating programs under a single Federal authority with State agencies are also required."
