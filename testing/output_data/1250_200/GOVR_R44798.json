    "content": "Following each decennial census, the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided among the 50 states, with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. Congressional redistricting must occur every 10 years to ensure equal population distribution among districts. This process involves state and federal legal requirements, including constitutional provisions like the Elections Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause ensures equal protection under the law, while redistricting maps must comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congressional district boundaries must adhere to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices, including minority vote dilution and denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or language minority membership. It also ensures equal opportunity for minority groups to elect representatives of their choice. Before 2013, Section 5 required certain states to obtain preclearance for voting law changes, including redistricting maps. The Voting Rights Act required states to prove non-discrimination in redistricting maps to obtain preclearance. In Shelby County, the Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, impacting Section 5 as well. This decision affected nine states and jurisdictions. The Supreme Court invalidated the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, impacting Section 5 and removing preclearance requirements for nine states and jurisdictions within six additional states. This decision has significantly influenced redistricting disputes and the drawing of congressional districts, addressing population equality, the Voting Rights Act, partisan gerrymandering, and the constitutionality of state ballot initiatives for redistricting by independent commissions. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to require equal population in congressional districts, known as the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote.\" This principle was established in cases like Wesberry v. Sanders and Reynolds v. Sims, applying to both congressional and state legislative redistricting to ensure equal voting rights. The Supreme Court has set the \"equality standard\" for congressional and state legislative redistricting, requiring equal population distribution to ensure equal voting rights. The Court has specified the maximum population deviation allowed between districts, with stricter requirements for congressional districts compared to state legislative districts. In cases like Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, the Court invalidated redistricting plans with significant population deviations from the ideal equality standard. The Supreme Court has established the \"equality standard\" for redistricting, requiring equal population distribution for voting rights. The Court has set maximum population deviation limits for congressional and state legislative districts. In cases like Karcher v. Dagett and Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission, the Court emphasized the need for population equality unless deviations serve legitimate state objectives like compactness and respecting boundaries. The Court in Tennant outlined a two-pronged test for congressional redistricting plans, requiring challengers to prove population differences could have been avoided and states to justify deviations with legitimate objectives. The state's burden is flexible and depends on factors like population deviation size and importance of state interests. In Tennant, the Court found that maintaining county boundaries and minimizing population shifts were valid state policies justifying minor population disparities. The Supreme Court upheld a 0.79% maximum population deviation between congressional districts, citing valid state policies like maintaining county boundaries and minimizing population shifts. The Court's redistricting jurisprudence often deals with balancing the VRA's requirements and equal protection standards, guiding map drawers on the delicate balance needed in redistricting based on race. The VRA may require creating majority-minority districts in congressional redistricting to prevent vote denial based on race or language minority membership. The Supreme Court's three-pronged test in Thornburg v. Gingles establishes criteria for proving vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA. The Supreme Court's three-pronged test in Thornburg v. Gingles establishes criteria for proving vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA, including the need for a single-member district, political cohesion of the minority group, and bloc voting by the majority. Factors such as history of discrimination and racially polarized voting are considered in assessing the totality of the circumstances. The Supreme Court's three-pronged test in Thornburg v. Gingles establishes criteria for proving vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA, including factors like racially polarized voting, candidate slating process access, discrimination effects on education, employment, and health, racial appeals in political campaigns, and minority group representation in public office. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court ruled that minority groups must constitute more than 50% of the voting population in a district to satisfy the first prong of the three-pronged test. The Court rejected the argument that minority groups needing to form political coalitions should receive special protection under Section 2 of the VRA. This decision was based on the belief that mandating recognition of Section 2 claims where minority groups rely on \"crossover\" majority voters would conflict with the third prong of the Gingles test. The Supreme Court ruled in Bartlett v. Strickland that minority groups must make up over 50% of the voting population in a district to meet the first prong of the Gingles test. The Court also stated that Section 2 of the VRA may require the creation of majority-minority districts in certain circumstances to prevent racial vote dilution. Additionally, redistricting plans must adhere to equal protection standards under the Fourteenth Amendment, ensuring that race is not the predominant factor in drawing district lines. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to cases involving racial gerrymandering, where race is the predominant factor in drawing district lines. Plaintiffs must prove that racial considerations were dominant in creating the districts. Compliance with the Voting Rights Act can sometimes conflict with equal protection standards. Plaintiffs must prove that racial considerations were dominant in creating the districts. In Easley v. Cromartie, the Supreme Court upheld a 47% black district in North Carolina as not being an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Court emphasized that challengers must show that race, not politics, predominantly influenced the district's boundaries. The Court held that challengers failed to prove that race, rather than politics, primarily influenced the redistricting process. In cases involving majority-minority districts, challengers must demonstrate alternative ways for the legislature to achieve its political objectives. The Court emphasized the need for a district-by-district analysis to determine if race is a predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny. The Court confirmed that in determining the predominance of race in redistricting, traditional race-neutral principles should not be weighed against the use of race. The Alabama Court also clarified that Section 5 of the VRA does not require a specific percentage of minority voters in a minority-majority district, but rather aims to maintain the minority's ability to elect their preferred candidate. The Court clarified that Section 5 of the VRA requires a minority-majority district to maintain a minority's ability to elect their preferred candidate. This decision may be of interest to Congress for drafting a new coverage formula. In a recent case, the Court added clarification to the standard for racial predominance in a racial gerrymandering claim. The federal district court is considering whether 11 of the 12 \"majority-minority\" districts created by Virginia in 2011 are permissible under the Voting Rights Act. The districts were drawn with a black voting-age population of at least 55%, but a lawsuit filed in 2014 argued that they were racial gerrymanders violating the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court held that the district court erred in requiring a \"conflict or inconsistency\" as a precondition for establishing a claim of racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court clarified that a conflict between redistricting map and traditional criteria is not necessary to prove racial gerrymandering. The Court rejected Virginia's argument that racial predominance requires grouping voters of the same race without shared interests. Instead, the Court emphasized that the constitutional violation in racial gerrymandering cases stems from the racial purpose of state action, not just its manifestation. The Supreme Court emphasized that racial gerrymandering stems from the racial purpose of state action, not just its manifestation. The Court is also considering the case of Cooper v. Harris, which involves the issue of racial gerrymandering in North Carolina's congressional redistricting map. In 2013, plaintiffs filed suit in federal court, alleging North Carolina used VRA's preclearance requirements as a pretext to pack African-American voters into Congressional Districts 1 and 12, reducing their influence in other districts. The court found CDs 1 and 12 to be unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, applying strict scrutiny and determining insufficient evidence that CD 1's creation was reasonably necessary for VRA compliance. The court found CD 1 and CD 12 to be unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, as the defendants failed to prove compliance with the Gingles three-prong test. The creation of CD 1 was deemed unnecessary for VRA compliance, and CD 12 was invalidated for lacking a compelling interest in using race for districting. Redistricting maps must balance VRA requirements with equal protection standards. The Supreme Court has set standards for determining unconstitutional racial gerrymandering in redistricting maps, requiring a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring. Recent case law emphasizes a district-by-district analysis and eliminates the need to show conflict with traditional redistricting criteria. Ongoing cases may further clarify these standards. The Supreme Court has struggled to establish a manageable standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, as seen in the 2004 case of Vieth v. Jubelirer. The Court has defined partisan gerrymandering as drawing district lines to benefit one political party over another, but has been unable to decide on a clear standard for judicial review. In the 2004 case of Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Supreme Court struggled to establish a standard for unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Justice Kennedy suggested that claims of partisan gerrymandering may be justiciable under the First Amendment, providing a potential avenue for relief in future cases. In future cases claiming unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, Justice Kennedy suggested that a more relevant constitutional provision could be the First Amendment, focusing on not burdening citizens based on their participation in the electoral process, voting history, political party association, or expression of political views. He emphasized that an analysis under the Equal Protection Clause would consider the permissibility of redistricting plan classifications, with race being almost never permissible. Justice Kennedy argued that when a generally permissible classification like political party association is used for an impermissible purpose, the key question is whether it imposed an unlawful burden on representational rights based on ideology, beliefs, or political views. This approach under the First Amendment may provide a better basis for intervention in such cases. In the 2006 decision League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (\"LULAC\"), the Supreme Court was divided on whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable. A plurality of four Justices opined that such claims are justiciable but could not agree on a standard for adjudicating them. Two Justices believed these claims are not justiciable, while Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito generally agreed with Justice Kennedy's position, leaving the possibility open for future cases. In the aftermath of LULAC, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito agreed with Justice Kennedy's position on partisan gerrymandering, leaving open the possibility for future cases to establish a standard for adjudicating such claims. Recently, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to address this issue in the Whitford v. Gill case, where a federal district court ruled a Wisconsin state legislative redistricting map unconstitutional. In 2011, Wisconsin redrew its state legislative redistricting map, which favored the Republican Party in the 2012 and 2014 elections. Democratic supporters challenged the map, claiming it violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment. The district court agreed, ruling that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional. The district court ruled that a redistricting map violating the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause by hindering a citizen's vote based on political affiliation is unconstitutional. The court emphasized protecting a citizen's vote from discrimination based on political preferences, citing a 1968 Supreme Court ruling on political gerrymandering. The state laws place burdens on the rights of individuals to associate for political beliefs and qualified voters to cast their votes effectively. The redistricting plan was found to aim at securing the Republican Party's control of the state legislature, increasing the number of districts favoring one political party. The court found that the redistricting plan aimed to entrench one political party's control of the state legislature by ensuring they would maintain a majority of seats for a 10-year period. This was achieved by allocating votes in a way that prevented the party from dropping below 50% in any election scenario. The court also introduced a new measure called the \"efficiency gap\" to calculate the asymmetry among districts. The \"efficiency gap\" (EG) measures wasted votes in an election, representing the difference between parties' wasted votes. It assesses redistricting methods like \"cracking\" and \"packing\" to diminish one party's electoral power. EG does not require proportional seat allocation but measures deviation from the relationship. The court used the Efficiency Gap (EG) to determine partisan gerrymandering in the redistricting plan, finding it created a burden on representational rights. The plan's discriminatory effect was not justified by political geography or legitimate state interest. The court found that the Wisconsin redistricting plan was not justified by political geography or legitimate state interest, leading to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Multiple alternative plans could have achieved the same goals with less partisan advantage, but were not used. The court deferred ruling on a remedy but enjoined the plan in January 2017. The Wisconsin state legislative plan was deemed an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, leading to an injunction against its use in future elections. The Supreme Court has yet to establish a clear standard for addressing such claims. Some states have implemented independent redistricting commissions to address concerns about partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of independent redistricting commissions established by ballot initiative, removing control of congressional redistricting from state legislative bodies. This decision was made in the case of Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, where the Court ruled that a commission can draw congressional districts instead of a state legislature, based on the Elections Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of independent redistricting commissions established by ballot initiative, allowing them to draw congressional districts instead of state legislatures. The Court emphasized that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to override state election laws to prevent political manipulation by state politicians. The term \"legislature\" in the Constitution varies in meaning depending on the context, as seen in previous cases reviewed by the Court. The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"legislature\" in the Constitution to have varying meanings depending on the context. Previous cases have shown that it can include veto powers held by the people through referendums and governors. The Court also ruled that states can empower their people with legislative functions, even through initiatives, as it aligns with the Constitution's principle that the people are the source of governmental power. The Supreme Court ruled that states can use citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process, in line with the Constitution's principle that the people are the source of governmental power. Arizona's congressional redistricting process complies with federal redistricting laws, allowing states to use their own laws and regulations, including initiatives, in creating congressional districts. Congress amended the congressional apportionment statute in 1911 to give states full authority in redistricting. The Supreme Court ruled that states can use citizen initiatives in the legislative process for congressional redistricting, as Congress amended the apportionment statute in 1911. This allows states to create districts using their own laws, as seen in Arizona's process. The Court clarified that states can enact laws through initiatives, similar to California's independent commission for redistricting. This decision suggests that state constitutional provisions for redistricting through initiatives are likely to be upheld under the Elections Clause. The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly influenced congressional redistricting through its rulings, shaping how districts are drawn and the success of challenges to redistricting plans. The Court has established that districts must have roughly equal populations and can deviate if justified by state objectives. Additionally, the Court requires that race cannot be the predominant factor in drawing district lines, as interpreted under the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court has set guidelines for congressional redistricting, emphasizing equal population distribution and limiting the use of race as the main factor in drawing district lines. Currently, the Court is reviewing cases on racial and partisan considerations in redistricting, including the establishment of standards for unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Additionally, a 2015 ruling allows states to create nonpartisan independent commissions for drawing congressional districts through ballot initiatives and referenda. The Supreme Court ruling allows states to create nonpartisan independent commissions for drawing congressional districts through ballot initiatives and referenda."
