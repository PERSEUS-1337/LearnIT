    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that large truck crashes are more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes, totaling 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes not only result in human loss but also impose a significant economic cost on society. The Department of Transportation estimates that highway crashes cost society $230.6 billion a year. Investments in advanced safety technologies by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to mitigate commercial motor vehicle crash scenarios. The goal is to reduce the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. The accelerated deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles can reduce injuries and fatalities on the roads. Congress aims to increase the adoption of these technologies by providing tax incentives to make them more affordable for businesses.
