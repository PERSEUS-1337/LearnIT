The study reveals that hidden neurons function as binary classifiers during training and testing, separating inputs into distinct categories. These observations shed light on the internal mechanics of neural networks and have the potential to influence future theoretical and practical advancements in the field. The curr_chunk discusses the surprising capabilities of deep neural networks, such as object detection and universal representations, even with limited memory or computation. However, challenges like continuous learning, robustness, and unsupervised learning still exist. The paper aims to explore the characteristics of SGD trained neural networks that lead to these behaviors and limitations. The curr_chunk delves into the complexities of deep neural networks, emphasizing the need for a better understanding through experiments due to theoretical limitations. It highlights the mystery surrounding hidden neurons and their potential role in detecting relevant concepts. The focus on interpretability and abstraction levels of these neurons in convolutional networks is a common theme in research. The curr_chunk discusses how the encoding and dynamics of a neuron in deep neural networks can be characterized by the behavior of a binary classifier. It emphasizes the need for experimental approaches to understand the information processing of neurons, especially in convolutional networks. The behavior of neurons in deep neural networks can be characterized by the sign of the partial derivative of the loss with respect to activation, leading to a binary partition of inputs. This behavior is consistent across different layers and networks, indicating a simple yet undiscovered phenomenon in neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. The function of a neuron in convolutional neural networks for image classification is focused on interpretability. Recent works have developed methods to visualize how the activation of a single neuron is related to the input image, including training deconvolution networks and analyzing neuron activation when occluding parts of the input image. Inverse problem formulations have been used to reconstruct images by inverting representations obtained inside the network. Recent advancements have focused on quantifying the interpretability of the signal extracted through visualization methods, showing that individual neurons can capture important image features. The interpretability of individual neurons in CNNs for image classification has been studied through visualization methods. Object detection emerges in units with high activation, suggesting a binary encoding within the network. However, it is unclear if this reflects all relevant information in the feature maps. The study aims to validate the encoding of information in neurons and relates to network binarization for reducing computational and memory requirements. Our work challenges the binary nature of individual neurons by showing that a bimodal activation pattern naturally emerges from conventional training procedures, even in deep linear networks. This observation goes beyond previous methods that induce a negligible loss in accuracy with binary values. Our work challenges the binary nature of individual neurons by showing that a bimodal activation pattern naturally emerges from conventional training procedures, even in deep linear networks. The gradients used by the learning algorithm follow consistent patterns, with a focus on gradients with respect to activations on single samples. This perspective is crucial for understanding the representation learned by neurons in a neural network. Neurons are associated with activation functions, where each application of a non-linear function to a single value defines one neuron. The pre-activation value and the activation result are key components in defining neurons. In studying statistical distributions of activations in convolutional layers, different pixels of a feature map are considered as activations from the same neuron. Three architectures are experimented with: a 2-layer MLP with dropout trained on MNIST, a 12-layer CNN with batchnorm trained on CIFAR-10, and a 50-layer ResNet trained on ImageNet. Different activation functions are analyzed, including ReLU and sigmoid. Specific layers of these networks are referred to throughout the paper. The ResNet50 network is used with Keras applications, and layers are referred to by stage and position. The study focuses on analyzing gradients with respect to activations to understand neuron behavior. Experiments were conducted using Keras and Tensorflow libraries. During training of the ResNet50 network, gradients with respect to activations are analyzed to understand neuron behavior. The gradient of the loss with respect to activations is recorded regularly, and the average sign of partial derivatives indicates whether increased activation benefits or penalizes sample classification. Zero partial derivatives may occur when a sample is correctly classified, leading to very small gradients. During training of the ResNet50 network, the analysis of gradients with respect to activations reveals that zero partial derivatives may occur when a sample is correctly classified, resulting in very small gradients. The average sign of partial derivatives indicates whether increased activation benefits or penalizes sample classification. The histograms in FIG1 show that the average partial derivative sign is consistently either 1 or -1 for most samples, indicating a clear and regular signal in the activation gradients. This behavior aligns with the expected output of a binary classifier separating two categories. The activation gradients in ResNet50 training show a regular signal, with activations consistently pushed in the same direction for improved prediction. However, noise in gradients increases with depth in ReLU-networks, leading to sign changes in early layers. The linear version of the cifar CNN provides a clearer signal compared to the ReLU version. The cifar CNN (fourth row) shows a clearer signal than the ReLU version (third row), but noise is still present. The question of whether this noise is a result of architecture and training or a key aspect of learning is left for future work. Gradients suggest neurons are trying to separate input categories, with slow but effective progress seen in the visualization. Categories 'low' and 'high' are assigned based on average activation partial derivative signs, showing a struggle to separate them. More details can be found in the Appendix and video link provided. The visualization reveals a struggle to separate categories, with training showing slow but effective progress. The question of what mechanism regulates well-partitioned samples in a neuron is raised. Histograms show distinct categories in neuron activations, indicating consistent information for binary classification. The neuron receives consistent information for binary classification, determined by the average sign of the loss function derivative. Categories are mainly fixed by network parameter initialization, with derivative signs heavily conditioned on input class. Neurons in the output layer show signs based on class label, not input. Categories in dense2-relu are mostly entirely present or absent, occasionally split between low and high categories. In dense2-relu, classes are either entirely present or absent in a category, determined by random initial parameters. Pre-activations are separated into high and low categories during training, showing that neurons operate as binary classifiers. Further exploration of these mechanisms is left for future work. Neurons operate as binary classifiers during training, and the study aims to test if all transmitted information is encoded in the binary partition. Strategies are designed to highlight the binary aspect and reveal structural components. The experiment focuses on testing the robustness of a neural network to quantization of pre-activations. ResNet50 is also studied in this context. The experiment tests if a neural network is robust to quantization of pre-activations by using two distinct values per neuron based on percentiles. Eleven thresholds are tried, and accuracy on the test set is analyzed for different layers without training to adapt to the new distribution. Neural networks show robustness to quantization of pre-activations, with performance being stable across different layers. Only the conv1 layer from ResNet50 exhibits a significant decrease in accuracy. The experiment raises questions about how the signal is encoded and the threshold for categorizing pre-activations. The experiment involves a sliding window binarization method to categorize pre-activations in neural networks. By using two thresholds forming a window, activations are mapped to 1 or 0. The window slides from rank 5 to rank 95 with a width of 10 percentile ranks, preserving only information on whether the activation was inside or outside the window. The experiment involves sliding window binarization of pre-activations in neural networks. The transformed pre-activations are monitored for test accuracy after reinitialization and retraining of subsequent layers. Quantization is performed on a single layer at a time using percentile ranks as thresholds. This approach helps observe the binary partition used to encode information and analyze the network's ability to generalize patterns to the test set. The experiment involves sliding window binarization of pre-activations in neural networks, with quantization performed on a single layer at a time using percentile ranks as thresholds. The networks show robustness to quantization, suggesting neurons provide a binary signal to the next layers. Results indicate that performance improves when the window is away from rank 50, indicating better network performance. The results in Figure 4 show that network performance improves when the window center is further from rank 50, with a clear symmetry around percentile rank 50. This suggests a fuzzy partition of two categories with varying sizes across neurons, supporting the hypothesis of distinct but overlapping categories. The binary behavior observed in pre-activations is not causally related to activation function thresholding. The binary behavior observed in pre-activations is symmetrically arranged around the 50th percentile rank. The position of ReLU or sigmoid thresholds is not symmetric. Linear networks also exhibit binary behavior, even without thresholding effects in hidden neurons. The hypothesis suggests neurons behave like binary classifiers, separating two categories of inputs provided by backpropagated gradients. Experiments on networks of different depths and widths validate this behavior, with implications for neural network training and testing. Our experiments validate the binary behavior of neurons in deep networks, distinguishing half of observed samples. This behavior differs from focusing on highest activations and has implications for neural network interpretability and training dynamics. Further investigations are needed to understand the regularity of gradients in deep network layers. Our work offers a new perspective on the role of activation functions in deep networks, suggesting a local and precise role in promoting binary encoding in neurons. This insight could lead to the design of activation functions with well-positioned binarization thresholds for improved training dynamics. Our work provides a new angle on the generalization gap and the role of activation functions in promoting binary encoding in neurons. The results of a sliding window binarization experiment reveal a clear pattern of encoding based on a fuzzy, binary partition of inputs. The results confirm a binary partition encoding pattern across all layers and networks trained on different datasets. The prioritization effect of local minima with good generalization abilities is highlighted, suggesting that the slope leading to them also matters. The sign of the loss function partial derivative remains constant for neurons close to the output during training. The loss function partial derivative sign remains constant for neurons close to the output during training. Binarization of neuron pre-activations in any layer preserves most task information. The observations raise important questions about network learning capabilities, such as convergence in noisy environments and activation function design. The curr_chunk discusses training information for a neural network architecture, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and data augmentation. It also mentions the use of convolution, activation functions, BatchNormalization, maxpooling, and global average pooling in the network. Additionally, it records gradients and pre-activations for different layers using randomly selected samples. The architecture is based on ResNet50 from keras applications. The curr_chunk discusses the ReLU threshold position in neurons of a layer, showing convergence to a precise position in pre-activation distribution. It also presents histograms of average derivative signs collected over training for neurons in different layers. The curr_chunk discusses the statistics of average derivative signs for neurons in different layers during training. It shows how some neurons consistently affect sample activations, allowing them to act as binary classifiers. The histograms reveal that half of the input samples have negative derivatives and the other half have positive ones. The evolution of pre-activation distributions across training is also analyzed for different types of neurons. The curr_chunk illustrates the evolution of pre-activation distributions across training for neurons in different layers. It shows how high and low pre-activations are separated during training, with the final highest pre-activations highlighted. The video format of these illustrations can be viewed on a specific YouTube channel. The final highest pre-activations of the high category are highlighted to show separation during training. Histogram displays consistency between sample class and belonging to low neuron category in dense2-relu, with peaks at 0 and 100%.
