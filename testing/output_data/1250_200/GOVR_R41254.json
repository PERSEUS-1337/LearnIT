    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction from the President's request. Additionally, $17.8 billion was provided for DOD's military construction budget in H.R. 1473. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for the Department of Defense, with $2.2 billion less than the President's request. The bill included reductions in various categories of spending, such as rescinding $2.0 billion from prior fiscal years, cutting $1.5 billion proportionately from projects and programs, reducing civilian pay by $723 million, and cutting $125 million from federally funded research and development corporations. Significant reductions were also made to major weapons programs, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The H.R. 1473 bill made significant cuts to the President's DOD budget, including $473 million for a new ground combat vehicle for the Army and $325 million for a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. However, the bill also added funds to various programs such as $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard equipment, $661.7 million for medical research, $523.2 million for innovative research, $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense systems, and $165.0 million for the Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House and Senate proposed different versions of a defense authorization bill, with the Senate bill facing opposition due to a provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. After negotiations, a compromise version (H.R. 6523) was passed without the controversial provision and signed by the President on December 22, 2010. The authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed by the President on January 7, 2011, supporting the Administration's budget request. It included a 1.4% increase in basic pay for military personnel and $485 million for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. Additionally, $5.3 billion in mandatory spending was allocated, mainly for military retirees. The FY2011 budget request for the Department of Defense included $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, bringing the total request to $708.3 billion. An additional $33 billion was requested for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. This request was $3 billion lower than the previous year's war budget. The FY2010 war budget included a $33 billion increase for operations in Afghanistan. An additional $655 million was allocated for humanitarian relief in Haiti. The FY2011 base budget requested a 3.4% increase, with 1.8% real growth in purchasing power. Other \"security agencies\" would also see real growth in spending. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. Non-security agencies saw a 1.5% decrease in funding. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, providing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. This continues the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998. The FY2011 DOD base budget shows a steady upward trend since FY1998, with the requested budget being the third largest since the Korean War. Annual increases in the budget fall short of the 2% real growth rate needed for investments through FY2015. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to provide real growth for combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. This would involve increasing funding for the fighting force (\"tooth\") by cutting costs in administrative functions (\"tail\") to sustain the current force structure amidst economic challenges. Secretary Gates proposed reallocating funds within the budget to increase support for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support functions. This shift aims to achieve sustainable growth by making significant changes to the department's structure and operations, including reducing funding for service support contractors, cutting the number of generals and admirals, and eliminating certain bureaucratic entities like the Joint Forces Command and Business Transformation Agency. Secretary Gates proposed reducing the number of generals and admirals by 50, senior DOD civilians by 150, and eliminating certain bureaucratic entities to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, which account for a significant portion of the department's annual spending. Some Members of Congress argue that the Administration's projected budget increases for the Department of Defense may be insufficient due to rising costs of personnel and operations. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about potential cuts to acquisition programs with only a 1% real growth in the defense budget over the next five years. On the other hand, Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments. President Obama's deficit reduction plan exempts the military budget, leading to potential cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD budget request remains steady at 3.6% of GDP, reflecting previous initiatives and strategies outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) reflects a shift in DOD strategic thinking towards readiness for diverse missions, prioritizing ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report emphasizes the need to support forces engaged in current operations and institutionalize capabilities for counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recommends increased funding for acquiring helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade and potentially more in the future. The report assumes that future adversaries will not directly challenge U.S. conventional military capabilities but will instead pose different types of threats. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for the military to be prepared for unconventional tactics and technologies used by adversaries, such as cyber-warfare. It highlights the importance of operating effectively in cyberspace and calls for strengthening defense capabilities in this domain. The report recommends specific steps to enhance DOD operations in cyberspace. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the importance of defending cyber-networks and calls for specific steps to enhance DOD operations in cyberspace. It also highlights the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for various missions around the globe, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. The 2010 QDR emphasizes preparing U.S. forces for asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by China and other adversaries. These threats target U.S. forward bases and naval forces crucial for projecting power globally, which are costly to maintain and make U.S. defense spending the highest in the world. The 2010 QDR highlights the vulnerability of U.S. power projection capabilities to anti-access strategies, such as attacks on ground bases and naval forces. Recommendations include increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines, as well as developing offensive electronic attack capabilities. Missile defense is also emphasized as a costly but necessary measure. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. End-strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, meeting goals three years earlier than expected. In 2010, Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400. The budget included a $1 billion raise in basic pay for military personnel, matching private-sector pay increases. The Basic Allowance for Housing was also set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has consistently approved military pay raises higher than the Employment Cost Index increase since FY2004. In 2010, Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400 and approved a $1 billion raise in basic pay for military personnel to match private-sector pay increases. DOD officials argue that service members are already better paid than 70% of private sector workers and suggest allocating funds to reenlistment bonuses and special pays instead of a higher across-the-board raise. Military advocacy groups push for a higher increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the policy due to stress from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two bills in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the 1993 law on sexual orientation discrimination. President Obama called for nondiscrimination against same-sex orientation in his 2010 State of the Union Address. DOD launched a study on implementing this change, with Secretary Gates opposing repeal until the study's completion. Gates opposed repealing the 1993 law until a study was completed. Changes were made to enforcement procedures, requiring high-ranking officers to initiate investigations. A proposed amendment would repeal the ban on openly homosexual individuals in the military after certain conditions were met. In response to congressional action, the Administration supported a draft amendment to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law. Despite Secretary Gates' preference for completing the DOD study first, the Administration accepted the proposed amendment. In September 2010, a federal judge ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional, leading to an injunction against its enforcement in October 2010. In October 2010, Judge Phillips enjoined DOD from enforcing the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Act. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction while considering the appeals process. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior to five senior officials. The DOD health care system budget for FY2011 was $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past decade and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD's health care system budget for FY2011 was $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries. The cost has doubled in the past decade and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The increase in military health care costs is attributed to factors such as an increase in retirees using TRICARE, legislative benefits expansions, and no fee increases since 1995. Despite proposals to raise fees, Congress has passed legislation to prohibit them. The Obama Administration did not propose fee increases in 2011, but Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress on the issue. In a press conference on February 1, 2010, Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control TRICARE costs. The FY2011 budget requested an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement over R&D. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program received a significant budget allocation for both R&D and procurement. The FY2011 budget requested $11.2 billion, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The Administration proposed cuts in major weapons programs, including no funds for C-17 jets or an alternate F-35 engine. Congress added funding for these programs in 2009. Questions were raised about the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which included $3.2 billion for FY2011. One controversial element is the design of a proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle. The Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, with a budget of $3.2 billion in FY2011, replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. The FCS program aimed to develop new combat equipment but was canceled due to design issues. The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program was launched to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. The Army replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which had a budget of $3.2 billion in FY2011. The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program aimed to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract in August 2010 and restarted it in November 2010. The program incorporates sensors, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, and a modified FCS command and control network into the Army's Modernization program. The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program aims to deploy Future Combat System components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, with a total of 50 new ships planned over five years. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan falls short of fully supporting the 313-ship goal. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to grow the fleet from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. However, it falls short of fully supporting the 313-ship goal in the long run. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year, but a Congressional Budget Office report estimates it would need $19.0 billion per year. This discrepancy could impact the Navy's ability to afford all the purchases in the 2011 plan. The Navy's shipbuilding plan aims to increase the fleet to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. However, it may not afford all purchases in the 2011 plan due to funding discrepancies. Specific shipbuilding issues include the development of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, with procurement estimated at $6-7 billion each. This program could compound the Navy's budget challenges. The Navy's plan to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines (SSBN(X)) could strain the budget for shipbuilding. Concerns arise that this program may limit the procurement rates of other Navy ships. Options to mitigate costs include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s, reducing missile capacity, or stretching out the procurement schedule. The Navy's plan to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines (SSBN(X)) may strain the shipbuilding budget. Options to mitigate costs include designing the SSBN(X) to carry a smaller SLBM, using split funding for procurement, and increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. Additionally, the Navy plans to resume procurement of Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class Aegis destroyers and terminate the CG(X) cruiser program in favor of an improved version of the DDG-51 starting in FY2016. The Navy plans to procure the Flight III version of the DDG-51 starting in FY2016, following the procurement of the Flight IIA version in FY2010-FY2015. The Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the supply. Demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are increasing faster than the supply, raising concerns about strain on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. The proposed FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. Congress faced decisions on approving the development of the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and providing direction to MDA or the Navy. Additionally, $1.59 billion was requested for two Littoral Combat Ships in FY2011. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) out of a planned force of 55. The Navy planned to choose between two different LCS designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, with the winning contractor building 10 LCSs over five years. Another competition would select a second shipyard to build up to five additional LCSs to the same design. The Navy planned to choose between two different LCS designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, with the winning contractor building 10 LCSs over five years. A second shipyard would be selected to build up to five additional LCSs to the same design in FY2012-FY2014. Navy officials sought approval to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team. There are concerns about a fighter aircraft shortfall in the Air Force and Navy due to budgetary limits on procurement. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortfalls, with projections of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 for the Air Force and over 100 aircraft for the Navy-Marine Corps by 2018. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with an estimated acquisition cost of over $300 billion, is key to modernizing the tactical aircraft force. Concerns about affordability and funding constraints have raised worries about the future of tactical aircraft acquisition. The F-35 program is the largest weapon procurement program for the DOD, with a total estimated acquisition cost of over $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program, including research and development funding. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the F-35 in the face of constrained DOD resources and budgetary challenges. The F-35 program is the largest weapon procurement program for the DOD, with an estimated acquisition cost of over $300 billion. The British government announced a plan to reduce their F-35 purchases from 138 to as few as 40 planes. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program for an alternate engine, with approximately $2.5 billion provided for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program. The Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program has received approximately $2.5 billion from Congress. The DOD estimated an additional $2.9 billion would be needed to complete the development of the F136 engine. Critics argue that terminating the F136 engine was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. Supporters of the termination claim that single-source engine production contracts are more cost-effective in the long run. The cancellation of the F136 engine procurement raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and efficiency in DOD acquisitions. It also questions the potential reduction in F-35 acquisitions and the challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's FY2011 defense budget includes funding for the KC-X tanker program. The FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for the Air Force's KC-X tanker program, aiming to replace aging KC-135 tankers. Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competed to build 179 new tankers, with bids submitted in July 2010. Boeing proposed a tanker based on the 767 airliner, while EADS offered one based on the Airbus A330. The DOD announced on February 24, 2011, that Boeing would be awarded the contract to build the new tanker, ending the competition with EADS. The KC-X acquisition program has been highly contested due to its value, job creation potential, and importance to military operations. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is crucial in defining the required capabilities and ensuring a fair competition. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) using BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for PAA programs, including development efforts unique to PAA and procurement of the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a 20% reduction compared to FY2010. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing is $18.7 billion, nearly 20% lower than FY2010. The reduction is mainly due to decreased spending on new facilities for units relocating from BRAC. Military family housing budget also decreased to $1.8 billion in FY2011 from $2.3 billion in FY2010, attributed to privatization of military family housing and increased Basic Allowance for Housing. The FY2011 DOD bills supported the Navy's plan to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port due to security reasons. This move would require new nuclear support facilities and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Members of Congress from Florida have expressed support for this decision. The proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Members of Congress from Florida support the plan, citing benefits for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs. However, some Members from Virginia are skeptical, questioning the benefits and suggesting that funding could be better spent on other Navy priorities. The Administration's budget includes funds for facilities on Guam for Marines and support personnel. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Additional military personnel will also be relocated to Guam from the U.S. by 2014-2016. Estimates suggest a potential increase of 56,000 in population, raising concerns about the island's infrastructure capacity to support such a surge. The Administration's budget supports the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. The reorganization of cyber forces began in 2008, integrating offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization. In 2009, U.S. Strategic Command established U.S. Cyber Command as one of its components. In June 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command for offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command while retaining the NSA directorship. Some concerns about militarization of cyberspace and privacy issues were raised. The FY2011 budget included $139 million for Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from FY2010, to set up facilities at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2010 Cyber Command budget includes funding for temporary facilities and infrastructure at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget request aims to \"rebalance\" roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation excludes two programs previously funded by DOD, now requested in the State Department budget: the \"Section 1207\" program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The State Department will also take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012. The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund for police training, despite police support funding in the State Department FY2011 budget request. The FY2011 budget includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund for police training, despite police support funding in the State Department budget. There is a debate over the roles of DOD and State Department in security assistance, with a review underway to determine the appropriate division of authorities. In a speech on February 24, 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces. This aligns with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report to strengthen the capability to train and advise partner nations' security forces. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen also highlighted the need to combine military power with diplomacy for effective national security. Both officials called for increased civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. The QDR report and top military officials advocate for bolstering civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. The FY2011 DOD budget includes funding for various security assistance programs, emphasizing the importance of integrating defense and diplomacy in international relations. The FY2011 budget includes funding for security assistance programs, including ministries and legal instruction for foreign military members. Secretary Gates emphasized the need to update the national security system, proposing a pooled fund for security assistance. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a bill authorizing $725.7 billion for defense activities, $240.7 million less than the Administration's request. The bill included a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy but was set aside after failing to invoke cloture. A compromise version of the bill (H.R. 6523) was signed into law on January 7, 2011, without the provision related to the policy. H.R. 6523, signed into law on January 7, 2011, authorized lump-sum totals for DOD and Energy Department budgets without specific program allocations. The bill authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the armed services, with a 1.4% increase in military basic pay. The House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise, adding $380 million to FY2011 military personnel costs. The final bill did not include provisions for an increase in monthly allowances for married personnel separated by deployment or for personnel at risk of hostile fire. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining qualified individuals in essential specialties. They also directed the GAO to review the process for offering incentives and determining housing allowances for service members. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The House had adopted an amendment to repeal the ban after a DOD review and certification from key officials. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons from military service. The Senate vote on cloture for consideration of the bill failed, with Senator McCain arguing for a delay due to ongoing DOD review. The bill did not include a provision from the Senate committee version regarding abortion in military facilities. The enacted version of the authorization bill did not include provisions from the Senate committee version that would have repealed the ban on using military facilities for abortions and authorized a pilot program for officers to pursue mid-career educational programs outside of their service. The final version of the bill establishes the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, requires improved protocols for medical care of sexual assault victims in the military, and guarantees access to victim advocates. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates. The final version of the bill, H.R. 6523, authorizes the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program. It requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of allowing sexual assault victims to receive assistance from military legal counsel. The bill also includes provisions prohibiting any increase in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. The enacted version of H.R. 6523 prohibits any increase in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. It allows TRICARE beneficiaries to extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, similar to private health insurance programs. The bill did not include a provision for a unified medical command or a new Defense Health Agency. It includes a requirement for proper documentation of academic and military performance for officers in the services' medical corps in response to an incident at Fort Hood in November 2009. The final version of the authorization bill, in response to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock, did not include provisions for special compensation to victims or earmarking funds for implementing recommendations. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions for special compensation to victims or earmarking funds for implementing recommendations. However, it supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including funding for missile defense and development of Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The bill did not allocate specific programs for the authorized funds, except for the $205 million for the \"Iron Dome.\" The final version of the authorization bill did not allocate specific programs for the authorized funds, except for the $205 million for the \"Iron Dome.\" H.R. 6523 does not specify funding for the Administration's missile defense plan, but includes provisions affirming that the New START treaty would not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for programs associated with the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. It includes restrictions on deploying defenses until technology is proven effective and host governments ratify agreements. The Secretary of Defense can waive restrictions for national security reasons. H.R. 6523 allows the Secretary of Defense to waive restrictions on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for national security reasons. It also authorizes a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic and includes statements on intercepting Iranian ICBMs, developing ground-based interceptors, and maintaining strategic stability with Russia. The final version does not include provisions from the House bill on U.S. nuclear weapons reductions. The final version of the authorization bill does not include provisions from the House bill on U.S. nuclear weapons reductions. It approved the $15.7 billion requested for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for specific programs like two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, and two Littoral Combat Ships. The Navy shipbuilding authorization bill includes funding for various programs such as two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, a high-speed troop and cargo carrier, an oceanographic research ship, the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt carrier refueling. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, with exceptions in the congressional appropriations process. The Navy shipbuilding authorization bill, H.R. 6523, includes provisions for funding a helicopter carrier (LHA-7) over two years and a report on the impact of using cruisers and destroyers with the Aegis anti-missile system for regional missile defense. The final bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in fleet size, such as blocking the retirement of helicopter carriers without replacements and limiting ship retirements until the fleet reaches 313 ships. The Senate committee has restricted the Navy from retiring more ships than commissioned until the fleet reaches 313 ships. They are concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and its impact on commercial shipyards. The committee wants assessments on how the Navy's plans will affect the Marine Corps's ability for amphibious landings. While Navy and Marine Corps leaders agree on the ideal number of amphibious landing ships, cost increases and delays may prevent reaching the reduced goal of 33 ships. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization bill did not include language regarding the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of submarines. These new ships, designated SSBN(X), are expected to absorb a significant portion of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, potentially impacting the construction of other planned ships. The bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying allocations for specific programs, and did not include a provision to limit Navy spending on the SSBN(X) program until certain information is provided by the Secretary of Defense. The final FY2011 defense authorization bill did not authorize funds for the C-17 wide-body cargo jet production, despite previous budget additions. The bill included provisions to address cost overruns and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, requiring DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan. The bill did not limit the number of F-35s procured until cost and performance milestones were met, authorizing a total of $11 billion for the program. The final FY2011 defense authorization bill did not authorize funds for the C-17 wide-body cargo jet production. It addressed cost overruns and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, requiring a progress assessment plan. The bill authorized $11 billion for the F-35 program, rejecting funding for an additional F-35 and an alternate jet engine. The House-passed bill included $485 million for the alternate engine, while the Senate committee's bill did not provide additional funds. The final bill did not take a specific position on the additional funding. The final bill did not include a Senate committee provision regarding additional funding for the alternate F-35 engine. Secretary Gates intended to recommend a veto if the bill funded the alternate engine, citing concerns about program feasibility. Both House and Senate committees expressed worries about a drop in carrier-borne fighters due to F-35 program delays. To address this \"strike fighter gap,\" both bills proposed additional funding. The enacted bill does not specify the number of F/A-18E/F model fighters to address the \"strike fighter gap.\" It includes a provision for the Navy to report on dealing with the gap by extending the service life of current F/A-18s or reducing the number of planes in certain squadrons.

The enacted version did not specify funding levels for the BCT program. The House and Senate bills denied authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program funding. The House urged a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program, focusing on basic requirements and potential upgrades. The Army was required to provide detailed plans before spending half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation. DOD reduced its funding request to $461 million, which was fully funded in the enacted bill.

If the Secretary of State couldn't certify by July 31, 2011, the Secretary of Defense could provide the funds for the Yemen project. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. This provision aimed to expand the Section 1206 program to support police agencies for domestic law enforcement. The Senate committee bill did not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding and cut the Administration's request to that level.
