The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to determine best practices for using health impact assessments to promote health and reduce disparities through public policies. The study will also review the health consequences of Federal policies and programs. A report on the study's results must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. States will review health consequences of Federal policies and programs, and consider health impact assessments for projects involving Federal funding or work. The Comptroller General will conduct a study, similar to the environmental impact statements process, and submit a report to Congress within one year. The National Demonstration Program is established under Section 3. The Secretary will award a grant to an institution of higher education to provide technical assistance, grants, and training on health impact assessments for community planning and policy making. The grant will also support the development of necessary data and evidence for health impact assessments and broad policy decisions. The Center will administer a demonstration grant program to consult with national organizations for health impact assessments.
