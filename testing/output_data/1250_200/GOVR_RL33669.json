    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), sparking a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill, along with the Terrorist Tracking, Identification and Prosecution Act of 2006. Senator Frist introduced the Terrorist Tracking, Identification and Prosecution Act of 2006, which included the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006. Several bills in the 109th and 110th Congress addressed electronic surveillance programs for foreign intelligence and counterterrorism. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides a framework for electronic surveillance and other investigative tools. The Bush Administration argued that electronic surveillance under FISA was valuable in combating terrorism but lacked speed and agility. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that FISC authorized targeting international communications involving al Qaeda members. Surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval, and the President decided not to reauthorize the TSP. The President has decided not to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) when the current authorization expires. The NSA program has faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and constitutional rights. The court ruled the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional and permanently enjoined it, leading to an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Legislation is being proposed to address electronic surveillance programs under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The proposed legislation aims to address electronic surveillance programs under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including changes to definitions, limitations on liability, and modifications to criminal provisions. The bills would repeal wartime authorities for surveillance without a warrant and discuss the impact of the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 on existing law. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. It defines electronic surveillance programs as those gathering foreign intelligence or combating terrorism, where specific targets cannot be named, and immediate or extended surveillance is necessary. The FISC would have jurisdiction to review and authorize these programs under the proposed legislation. Section 702(a) of FISA grants jurisdiction to the FISC to review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence or combating terrorism. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. If criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of FISA are met, surveillance must be discontinued. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under the electronic surveillance program authorized under Title VII of FISA if certain conditions are not met. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application is made for an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance under Section 105 of FISA. The bills also authorize the transfer of cases involving challenges to the legality of classified communications intelligence activity relating to a foreign threat to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General can trigger the transfer of a case to the FIS Court of Review by filing an affidavit stating that further proceedings in the originating court would harm national security. The proposed language in new Section 702(b)(1) of FISA requires the originating court to transfer the case upon filing of such an affidavit. However, there is uncertainty in the language of the proposed subsection 702(b)(1) regarding the specific court to which the case should be transferred. Additionally, proposed subsection 702(b)(2) of FISA gives jurisdiction to the FISC to determine standing and the legality of the program for resolution of the case. The FIS Court of Review has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of the program for resolution of the case. Any disclosure of national security information in a criminal proceeding would be governed by specific laws. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Challenges to the legality of electronic surveillance programs can be dismissed by the FISC or originating court for any lawful reason, while litigation privileges are preserved. A new Section 703 of FISA is created under Sec. 5 of S. 3931, setting out requirements for applications for electronic surveillance program approval. Subsection 703(b) authorizes the FISC to request necessary information for court determinations under new section 704. Sec. 6 of S. 3931, Sec. 206 of S. 3929, creates a new subsection 704 addressing necessary findings and contents of an ex parte FISC order approving a surveillance program. Factors for assessing constitutionality are identified in subsection 704(b) of FISA. Subsection 704(c) sets out the contents of an order approving such a program. The FISC considers factors in assessing program constitutionality. Sec. 7 of S. 3931, Sec. 207 of S. 3929, and new Sec. 705 of FISA address congressional oversight. The Attorney General submits classified reports every 180 days to intelligence committees. Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929, makes amendments to FISA, including repealing certain sections. Sec. 208(a) of S. 3929 repeals Sections 111, 309, and 404 of FISA, allowing electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war. Amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) would permit electronic surveillance by U.S. officials in the normal course of duty. Amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) would allow U.S. officials to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of duty under the Constitution or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The current provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f), ensures that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications is not affected by this chapter or other related laws. The Surveillance Act of 1978 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance and interception of domestic communications. Electronic surveillance is only allowed under FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121 of the U.S. Code. Amendments to FISA address the acquisition of foreign intelligence information authorized by federal statute or the Constitution. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The amendments specify criminal liability for engaging in unauthorized surveillance, disclosing or using information obtained through unauthorized surveillance, and using such information for unauthorized purposes. The penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance under Sec. 8(b)(2)(B) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2)(B) of S. 3929 would increase to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Sec. 9 of S. 3931 and Sec. 209 of S. 3929 make additional amendments to FISA, including expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power.\" The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA would involve the intentional acquisition of information from a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the intentional acquisition of communication contents from individuals in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA involves intentional acquisition of information from a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy, or communication contents from individuals in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy. Minimization procedures under FISA are designed to minimize acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, allowing retention and dissemination to law enforcement of evidence of criminal activity. The current FISA law includes minimization procedures for electronic surveillance to protect the privacy of US persons. Proposed changes would update these procedures to ensure that no communication involving a US person is disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 72 hours without proper authorization. The proposed changes to FISA law include updated procedures for electronic surveillance to protect the privacy of US persons. These procedures require that no communication involving a US person be disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 7 days without proper authorization. The proposed changes to FISA law include expanding the definition of \"contents\" in communications and authorizing electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The amendment to FISA law removes the requirement for the Attorney General to certify that surveillance will not acquire the contents of any communication involving a U.S. person. Electronic surveillance must still comply with certification and minimization procedures, with the Attorney General reporting to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must justify the belief that the target is indeed an agent. The Attorney General must provide a statement of facts to justify belief that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power agent. The current FISA law allows the Attorney General to direct common carriers to assist with surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimal interference. This provision is missing in the proposed FISA amendment. The proposed FISA amendment includes a new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year from individuals believed to be outside the US. This acquisition must not constitute electronic surveillance, involve communication service providers, have a significant intelligence purpose, and employ minimization procedures. The proposed FISA amendment grants the President, through the Attorney General, the authority to acquire foreign intelligence information from individuals outside the US for up to one year. The acquisition must not involve electronic surveillance, communication service providers, have a significant intelligence purpose, and employ minimization procedures. Compliance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures is required, with reporting to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General can direct a person to provide information and assistance for acquiring foreign intelligence, with secrecy protection. The person must keep records under approved security procedures and be compensated. Non-compliance can lead to FISC involvement and contempt of court. The person can challenge the directive's legality through a petition to FISC judges. A person can challenge the legality of a directive by filing a petition with the FISC judges. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours and make a determination within 72 hours. If the petition is not frivolous, the judge can modify or set aside the directive if it is found to be unlawful. Otherwise, the directive must be affirmed, and compliance ordered. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision on a petition seeking review of an FISC directive within seven days. The record of judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be maintained under security measures. Proposed subsections 102(h)-(k) of FISA outline procedures for handling classified information, immunity for providers of communication services, and limitations on the use and disclosure of information acquired under Attorney General authorization. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA provide procedures for use or disclosure of information in federal or state proceedings. The federal government can only use or disclose information acquired under Section 102 of FISA in any court or regulatory body with advance authorization. The proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA outline procedures for using information in federal or state proceedings. The government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before using or disclosing information obtained under Section 102 of FISA in any trial or hearing. Similarly, a state or political subdivision can only introduce such information in a proceeding if they notify the aggrieved person, the court, and the U.S. Attorney General. The proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA require notification to the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using information in federal or state proceedings. An aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence if unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. If the Attorney General affirms harm to national security, a motion to suppress can be made. The U.S. district court must determine the lawfulness of a Section 102 acquisition if a motion to suppress is filed or a request is made to discover related materials. The court can review relevant materials in camera and may disclose portions to the aggrieved person under security procedures. The court may disclose portions of the directive or related materials to the aggrieved person if necessary for determining the legality of the acquisition under proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA. If the U.S. district court finds an acquisition was not lawfully authorized, unlawfully obtained evidence would be suppressed; if authorized, the court would deny the aggrieved person's motion except for required discovery or disclosure. Orders related to Section 102 acquisitions would be binding on all federal and state courts except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court under proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA. Under proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA, orders related to Section 102 acquisitions would be binding on all federal and state courts except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal officers acquiring foreign intelligence information may coordinate with law enforcement to investigate or protect against various threats posed by foreign powers or their agents. Directives and orders under Section 102 of FISA must be retained for 10 years according to proposed subsection 102(u). Under Sec. 9(d) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(d) of S. 3929, FISA is amended to allow the Chief Justice to designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges. A new subsection 103(g) is added to provide authority for FISC orders under Title I of FISA. Sec. 9(e) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(e) of S. 3929 make amendments to Sec. 104 of FISA. Applications for electronic surveillance under FISA must contain specific information. The FISA amendments include replacing subsections 104(a)(1) to (11) with new subsections 104(a)(6) to (10). The certification for electronic surveillance orders would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an authorized executive branch official. Additionally, changes are made to subsection 104(b) regarding the exclusion of certain information in FISC orders for surveillance of foreign powers. The FISA amendments involve replacing subsections 104(a)(1) to (11) with new subsections 104(a)(6) to (10), with changes to subsection 104(b) regarding exclusion of information in FISC orders for surveillance of foreign powers. The application for surveillance on a foreign power must include details on whether physical entry is needed, surveillance techniques, and information on U.S. persons. The Attorney General and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall review applications for electronic surveillance under FISA. Amendments to FISA would involve changes to the approval process and specifications for electronic surveillance orders. The current subsection 105(c)(1) of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(c)(1), regarding specifications for electronic surveillance orders, will be replaced with a new subsection 105(c)(1) that combines current subsections and removes certain requirements. Additionally, current subsection 105(d) addresses excluding certain information from surveillance applications for foreign powers. The amended language in Section 105(c)(1) of FISA specifies the type of electronic surveillance needed, including the requirement for physical entry. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required, except for specific cases involving foreign-based political organizations or groups engaged in international terrorism. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for surveillance directed by foreign governments or against international terrorism groups. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted for up to one year, with new findings required. Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance without a court order can be granted for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for surveillance for up to one year with new findings required. Emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order can be granted for 72 hours by the Attorney General under current subsection 105(f), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(f). The surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA would be replaced with a new subsection 105(f) under S. 3931 and S. 3929. The new law would grant emergency electronic surveillance authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. The FISC judge must be informed of emergency surveillance decisions promptly under the new law. The decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance under new subsections 105(f)(2)(a) and (b). An application must be made to a FISC judge within seven days after authorization, replacing the current 72-hour requirement. Surveillance will terminate when information is obtained, the application is denied, or after seven days from approval by an executive branch officer. The emergency electronic surveillance authorized by an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval must follow minimization procedures. Changes to FISA include limitations of liability for those assisting with electronic surveillance or physical searches. The amendments to FISA provide limitations of liability for individuals assisting with electronic surveillance or physical searches, ensuring no cause of action can be taken against them if aid is provided in accordance with a court order or emergency request. Section 106 of FISA restricts the use of information acquired from electronic surveillance on unconsenting U.S. persons and includes notification requirements and the opportunity to suppress unlawfully acquired information in legal proceedings. The amendments to FISA provide limitations of liability for individuals assisting with electronic surveillance or physical searches, ensuring no cause of action can be taken against them if aid is provided in accordance with a court order or emergency request. Section 106 of FISA restricts the use of information acquired from electronic surveillance on unconsenting U.S. persons and includes notification requirements and the opportunity to suppress unlawfully acquired information in legal proceedings. Under the proposed amendments, unintentionally acquired communications must be destroyed unless they indicate a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA in S. 3886 and S. 2453 is unclear. It suggests inserting language regarding the destruction of unintentionally acquired communications containing significant foreign intelligence information. The proposed amendment to FISA includes provisions for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communications containing significant foreign intelligence information within the United States. This amendment also involves changes to congressional oversight provisions and conforming amendments to subsections of FISA. The proposed amendment to FISA includes provisions for a feasibility study to develop a secure document management system for electronic surveillance applications. This system would allow prompt preparation, modification, and review by relevant personnel before submission to the FISC. Amendments to Title I of FISA are also proposed, including defining categories of persons as \"agents of a foreign power.\" The proposed FISA amendment adds new categories of persons as \"agents of a foreign power,\" including those involved in weapons of mass destruction proliferation and international terrorism. The proposed FISA amendment expands the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals engaged in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities. It also defines \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, chemical weapons, biological agents, and other deadly weapons. The FISA amendment broadens the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include those involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities. It also expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include various deadly weapons. The proposed changes in FISA address the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as the international movements of surveillance targets. The FISA amendment broadens the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include those involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities. It also expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include various deadly weapons. Additionally, new provisions in FISA address the authorized period of physical search and the absence of the target from the United States. Amendments to the table of contents of FISA reflect changes in sections and titles within the legislation."
