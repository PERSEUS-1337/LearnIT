The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating consortiums as manufacturing communities and providing support to them. The term \"institution of higher education\" and \"Secretary\" are defined in the Act. The Act establishes a program for manufacturing communities to receive financial or technical assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, and Housing. The head of the agency can give preferential consideration to members who align with the economic development strategy of the consortium and meet all requirements. The Act establishes a program for manufacturing communities to receive assistance from various government agencies, including the Department of Education, Energy, Housing, Labor, Transportation, and others. Participating agencies must identify relevant programs for the established program. The Act establishes a program for manufacturing communities to receive assistance from government agencies. Participating agencies must identify programs for the established program, including preferences for consortium members seeking financial or technical assistance. The Act establishes a program for manufacturing communities to receive assistance from government agencies. Participating agencies must identify programs for preferences for consortium members seeking financial or technical assistance. Consortium members may be required to demonstrate coordination in developing their applications. The head of each agency must submit a report on how preferential consideration will be given. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities. The program provides financial and technical assistance to manufacturing communities through a designated consortium. Recipients can use the assistance to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. The program offers support for investments in infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, advanced research, and supply chain development to boost the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. Coordination is overseen by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs and avoid duplication of efforts in supply chain development. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. Eligible consortiums leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts. Eligible consortiums must represent a defined region and include institutions of higher education, private sector entities, and government entities. They may also involve private sector partners, government entities, economic development groups, financial institutions, and utilities. Eligible lead applicants for consortiums may include district organizations, Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, or special purpose units engaged in economic or infrastructure development activities. Eligible lead applicants for consortiums may include district organizations, Indian tribes, States, or institutions of higher education, as well as public or private nonprofit organizations acting in cooperation with political subdivisions. Consortiums can define their represented region to include key technologies while remaining small enough for close collaboration. Each designation under paragraph (1) prioritizes key technologies or supply chain elements and enables close collaboration among consortium members for a 2-year period. Renewal of a designation can be requested by eligible consortiums, with the Secretary having the discretion to approve it for another 2-year term upon application submission. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium that has changed its composition or submitted a revision to the plan. Evaluation for renewal includes assessing performance and progress of the consortium. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium based on the progress made with project-specific metrics, potential improvements to competitiveness of US manufacturing, and other relevant criteria. Application for designation involves assessing performance and progress of the consortium. An eligible consortium seeking a designation must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and competitive ranking nationally. The eligible consortium must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and competitive ranking nationally. The application should include an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem, workforce, supplier network, research, infrastructure, trade, operational improvements, and capital access components needed for manufacturing activities in the region. Additionally, an evidence-based plan for developing components of the ecosystem by making specific investments to address gaps is required. The consortium must describe specific investments to address ecosystem gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. They should also outline their proposed investments, implementation strategy, outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and evaluation methods. Other relevant matters may also be included as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The consortium must demonstrate regional cooperation and competitive manufacturing concentration in their proposal. Previously recognized manufacturing communities will be deemed as designated under this subsection. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from other agencies to support designated manufacturing communities under this Act."
