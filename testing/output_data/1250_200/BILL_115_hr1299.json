    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Berta Caceres Human Rights in Honduras Act\". Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses with impunity, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder. The New York Times revealed documents showing top officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators, and individuals with records of human rights abuses are appointed to high positions. International human rights bodies have reported abuses by the Honduran military and police. The Honduran military and police are known for committing human rights abuses, including killings, with impunity. Reports from the Associated Press and Human Rights Watch highlight the chronic problem of lethal force use by the national police, with investigations into abuses marred by inefficiency and corruption. The Department of State's 2016 Human Rights Report for Honduras also notes the serious issue of impunity, with slow or inconclusive prosecutions of military and police officials charged with violations. Efforts to clean up the police force have largely failed, with minimal progress in effectively prosecuting corrupt and abusive members. Rights Action documented the involvement of the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley. Human Rights Watch confirmed these killings went unpunished, with only one private actor convicted so far. Assassinations of activists, such as Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George, continue, highlighting ongoing human rights abuses by the military. The Honduran military has been involved in numerous human rights abuses, including the killings of activists like Tomas Garcia and Amado Maradiaga Quiroz. The government has expanded the military's role in domestic policing, leading to disastrous consequences such as the deaths of civilians like Ebed Yanes. The Honduran military has been implicated in human rights abuses, with reports of killings of civilians like Ebed Yanes and Erlin Misael Carias Moncada. The judicial system in Honduras is plagued by corruption, with officials linked to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to widespread impunity. Human Rights Watch highlights the rampant crime and impunity for human rights violations in the country. The Human Rights Watch reports in 2016 that Honduras is plagued by rampant crime and impunity for human rights abuses. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 exemplifies the human rights crisis in Honduras and the government's complicity. The government failed to protect Berta Caceres as mandated by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Eight suspects, including four with ties to the Honduran military, have been arrested in her killing. The Honduran military's role in her assassination is under scrutiny. The government restricts access to the case file, with the original file being stolen. Calls for justice have been made by Members of Congress and Caceres' family. The Honduran government has not allowed an independent investigation into the killing of Berta Caceres despite calls from various groups. Activists and critics of the government are at risk of human rights abuses, with previous abuses going unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina highlights the ongoing danger faced by activists. The Honduran government received significant funding for security measures, including $18,000,000 from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, and a $59,800,000 loan from the Inter-American Development Bank in 2012 with US approval. The Administration's funding request for fiscal year 2017 also includes an increase in security funding for Honduras. SEC. 3 of the document suspends security assistance to Honduras for its police and military, including equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to vote against any loans for the Honduran police or military at multilateral development banks. SEC. 4 outlines the conditions for lifting these suspensions and restrictions. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders, prosecuted human rights violators in the military and police, and withdrawn the military from domestic policing. Honduras has withdrawn the military from domestic policing, ensuring civilian authority over police functions. It protects the rights of various groups and has established the rule of law to prosecute human rights abuses by police and military members."
