    "content": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding on what networks have learned inside the deep generative representations and how photo-realistic images are able to be composed from random noises. This work shows that highly-structured semantic hierarchy emerges from the generative representations as the variation factors for synthesizing scenes. By probing the layer-wise representations with a broad set of visual concepts at different abstraction levels, the causality between the activations and the semantics occurring in the output image can be quantified. The generative representations learned by GAN are specialized to synthesize different hierarchical semantics: the early layers determine the spatial layout, the middle layers control categorical objects, and the later layers render scene attributes and color scheme. This set of manipulatable latent semantics facilitates semantic scene manipulation. The success of deep neural networks lies in representation learning, which uncovers explanatory factors in data. Prior research has shown that deep representations can spontaneously detect semantic concepts. Analyzing these representations provides insight into their generalization ability and feature transferability across tasks. However, current efforts mainly focus on discriminative models. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown the capability to transform random noises into high-quality images. However, the nature of learned generative representations and how photo-realistic images are composed in GANs remain less explored. Internal units of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) act as object detectors when trained to categorize scenes, providing an ideal solution for classifying scenes based on categorical objects. Synthesizing scenes requires deep representations to generate diverse scene images by producing individual objects relevant to specific scene categories and deciding the underlying room. The deep representations in GANs are crucial for generating diverse scene images by incorporating object details, room layout, lighting conditions, and color schemes. While previous work focused on object synthesis, understanding how GANs compose photo-realistic images with multiple variation factors at different levels remains a challenge. This study delves deeper into the hierarchical generative representations by matching layer-wise variation factors with human-understandable scene variations at layout, category, and attribute levels. The study explores how deep generative representations in GANs match layer-wise variation factors with human-understandable scene variations at different abstraction levels, including layout, category, attribute, and color scheme. By analyzing the causality between layer-wise activations and output semantics, the research identifies relevant variation factors across different layers of a GAN model. Early layers specify spatial layout, middle layers compose category-guided objects, and later layers render attributes and color schemes of scenes, enabling semantic image manipulation. The study delves into identifying manipulatable latent variation factors in GANs, enabling diverse semantic image manipulation. Various techniques have been explored to analyze internal representations of CNNs, including hidden unit analysis, back-propagation for saliency maps, and feature transfer studies. Additionally, the research examines how deep generative representations in GANs align with human-understandable scene variations at different abstraction levels. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly advanced image synthesis, with recent models able to create photo-realistic faces, objects, and scenes. This makes GANs useful for real-world image editing tasks like image manipulation, painting, and style transfer. Despite their success, it is still unclear what GANs have learned to produce such diverse and realistic images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have advanced image synthesis, creating realistic images. It is uncertain what GANs have learned to produce such diverse images. Recent studies have analyzed the generator units in GANs, showing they learn to synthesize visual contents like objects and textures. This work explores the emergence of multi-level semantics in the early latent space of GANs. The method involves using image classifiers to identify variation factors in generative representation. Decision boundaries are learned in the latent space for different concepts, and objects like sofas and TVs are added to the synthesized image. The artist refines details based on specified decoration styles. This process mimics how humans interpret scenes for drawing, contrasting with GANs that rely on end-to-end training for scene synthesis. In this work, the focus is on how GANs learn to synthesize photo-realistic scenes from scratch. Off-the-shelf classifiers are used to extract semantics from the output image, revealing that GANs construct scenes in a manner highly consistent with human perception. The synthesis process involves composing multi-level abstractions hierarchically, starting with spatial layout, followed by category-specified objects, and finally scene attributes. The method used to quantify emergent variation factors in GANs involves identifying meaningful concepts for scene synthesis models. This process includes probing latent space and using synthesized images to extract semantic information. To quantify emergent variation factors in GANs, meaningful concepts for scene synthesis models are identified by probing latent space and using synthesized images to extract semantic information. Semantic scores for each latent code are assigned using off-the-shelf image classifiers, forming a hierarchical semantic space S. Decision boundaries for concepts are established through bi-classification, separating latent space Z into sets based on the presence or absence of specific attributes like \"indoor lighting.\" The text discusses verifying manipulatable variation factors in GAN models by probing latent space and defining relevance through semantic scoring of latent codes. The process involves moving latent codes along normal vectors to quantify the relevance of variation factors to the target model. The text discusses quantifying the relevance of variation factors in GAN models by analyzing latent codes. A re-scoring technique is used to rank the factors, and a hierarchy of variation factors is identified in deep generative representations. The latent code is considered a \"generative representation\" in the context of synthesizing scenes in GANs. The text explores how GANs encode multi-level variation factors in deep generative representations, analyzing the StyleGAN model. It also discusses how GANs represent categorical information and how controlling activations can change the output image's category while preserving its layout and attributes. The approach can identify relevant attributes in a scene for semantic manipulation, with experiments conducted on StyleGAN, PGGAN, and BigGAN models. The text discusses training a mixed StyleGAN model on various scene images to understand how GAN encodes categorical information and objects. Image classifiers are used to assign semantic scores, extract color schemes, and manipulate scene attributes. GAN composes scenes hierarchically, allowing for independent and joint manipulation of variation factors in images. The text discusses training a mixed StyleGAN model on various scene images to understand how GAN encodes categorical information and objects. The model can manipulate variation factors in images at different layers, such as layout, objects, and lighting attributes. StyleGAN uses a disentangled latent space W and feeds the latent code w to each convolutional layer with different transformations. Layer-wise analysis is performed by studying the transformed latent code y instead of the conventional latent space Z. The importance of each layer with respect to variation factors is quantified using re-scoring techniques. The text discusses layer-wise analysis in GAN models, showing that different layers specialize in composing semantics hierarchically. The bottom layers determine layout, lower and upper layers control category and attribute variations, and color schemes are mostly rendered at the top. Visual inspection of variation factors is done by moving latent vectors along boundaries at different layers. Objects are transformed by GAN to represent different scene categories, with object segmentation masks varying when manipulating room layouts. The text discusses how GAN models can learn shared objects and object transformations across different scene categories. It also highlights the importance of manipulating latent codes at appropriate layers to achieve desired outputs, as changing codes at inappropriate layers may lead to inconsistent results. A user study was conducted to evaluate manipulability across layers by generating 500 samples and manipulating them with various concepts on different layers. The user study conducted evaluated manipulability across layers by generating 500 samples and manipulating them with various concepts. Results showed that hierarchical variation factors emerge in the generative representation for scene synthesis. The re-scoring method helps identify these factors, facilitating semantic scene manipulation by pushing latent codes towards desired attributes at appropriate layers. Manipulations include changing decoration style, furniture material, cleanliness, and even jointly manipulating hierarchical variation factors like room layout. The study evaluated manipulability in scene synthesis by manipulating hierarchical variation factors like room layout, scene category, and scene attribute in GAN models. The middle layers of GANs synthesize different objects for different scene categories, raising questions about scene categorization. The researchers further explored how GANs interpret scene categories and transform them from an object perspective using the StyleGAN model trained on various room categories. The study analyzed manipulability in scene synthesis using GAN models, focusing on object transformation across different room categories. A semantic segmentation model was used to segment objects in synthesized images, showing how objects are mapped between categories. For example, a sofa in a living room may be mapped to a pillow and bed in a bedroom, and further to a table and chair in a dining room. This demonstrates how objects are transformed during category changes. The study analyzed object transformation across different room categories using GAN models. Objects like a sofa in a living room can be mapped to different objects in other rooms, showing the ability to share objects across categories. This allows for control over image generation without the need for class labels, offering an alternative approach to traditional methods like BigGAN. The variation factors in scene synthesis depend on the training data, and the method was applied to a collection of StyleGAN models to capture a wide range of manipulatable attributes. The study applied a method to a collection of StyleGAN models to capture various manipulatable attributes in scene synthesis. Results show high consistency with human perception, indicating the effectiveness of the quantification method. Manipulation results with desired semantics were realistically achieved, showcasing the disentanglement of semantics in the generative representation. The study introduced a new metric for disentanglement analysis in generative representation, showcasing the effectiveness of quantification method in manipulating attributes in scene synthesis. The disentanglement of semantics was realistically achieved in StyleGAN models, aligning with human perception. Application of the method to other GAN structures further demonstrated its effectiveness. In addition to StyleGAN, the proposed method was applied to PGGAN and BigGAN models, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying manipulatable semantics. PGGAN does not support layer-wise analysis, but the re-scoring method can still be applied. BigGAN, a conditional GAN model, allows layer-wise analysis and shows that scene attributes can be best modified at upper layers. These results demonstrate the generalization ability of the approach and the emergence of manipulatable factors in other GANs. The paper demonstrates the emergence of structured variation factors in GANs with layer-wise stochasticity, allowing for photo-realistic scene manipulation. It introduces a re-scoring method to identify manipulatable semantic concepts and discusses the limitations and future directions of the approach. Additionally, it presents semantic scene manipulation results for various scene categories using StyleGAN and BigGAN models. In Sec. D, semantic scene manipulation results for various scene categories are presented. Sec. E details the model structures of StyleGAN and BigGAN, utilizing layer-wise latent codes. Sec. F includes an ablation study on layer-wise manipulation from different abstraction levels. The study experiments with PGGAN, StyleGAN, and BigGAN, trained on LSUN and Places datasets. Officially released models are used for PGGAN, while additional models are trained for StyleGAN on various indoor scene categories. For a more thorough analysis, additional models were trained on indoor and outdoor scene categories using the official implementation. The models were trained on a combination of images from different rooms for categorical analysis. The synthesis quality of each model was evaluated using Fr\u00e9chet inception distances. A conditional generative model was trained using PyTorch BigGAN implementation, with scene images synthesized at a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256. Off-the-shelf image classifiers were used to assign semantic scores to the synthesized images from multiple abstraction levels. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various models for analyzing scene images at different abstraction levels, including layout, category, scene attributes, and color scheme. These models include a layout estimator, scene category classifier, attribute predictor, and color scheme extractor. The models output probabilities for scene categories and attributes, and the layout estimator detects the spatial structure of indoor places. Additionally, a GAN model is used to generate synthesized scene images for analysis. The curr_chunk discusses using image classifiers to assign semantic scores for visual concepts in scene images. They select positive and negative samples, train a linear SVM, and re-generate samples for semantic verification. The essentiality of the re-scoring technique in identifying manipulatable semantics is verified. The study verifies the importance of the re-scoring technique in identifying manipulatable semantics by conducting an ablation study on a StyleGAN model trained for synthesizing bedrooms. The left figure shows attributes like \"no horizon\" and \"man-made\" are default and not manipulatable, while the re-scoring technique successfully filters out these and reveals more meaningful semantics like \"wood\" and \"indoor lighting\". The middle figure shows almost all attributes get similar scores, making them indistinguishable, with even the worst SVM classifier achieving 72.3%. The study demonstrates the limitations of relying solely on SVM classifiers to detect variation factors in latent space. Instead, the proposed method focuses on score modulation after varying the latent code, providing a more unbiased approach. This allows for a thorough and precise identification of variation factors. Despite the success of the re-scoring technique, there are limitations that can be addressed for future improvement. The limitations for future improvement include the need for a more general analysis of indoor and outdoor scenes, improving classifier accuracy for better manipulation boundaries, and exploring more complex semantic boundary search methods. The proposed method can identify hierarchical variation factors and facilitate semantic scene manipulation using StyleGAN, BigGAN, and PGGAN deep generative models. Experiments show manipulation results at different levels and architectures of the models. The StyleGAN, BigGAN, and PGGAN deep generative models employ layer-wise latent codes for high-resolution scene synthesis. StyleGAN and BigGAN introduce stochasticity by feeding latent codes to all convolutional layers, while PGGAN only feeds it to the first layer. Other GAN models like SinGAN and HoloGAN also use this design for better generation quality. Experimental results show that different layers correspond to layout, category, attribute, and color scheme in the models. The BigGAN model has 12 convolutional layers with 256x256 resolution. The layers are divided into lower and upper groups, with upper layers better controlling attribute-level semantics. Manipulating attributes at upper layers yields desired outputs, while lower layers result in unexpected variations. Ablation studies on StyleGAN show that manipulating attributes at all layers affects objects in the scene, highlighting the importance of layer-wise manipulation for semantic hierarchy. Manipulating latent codes at attribute-relevant layers increases indoor lighting without affecting other factors. Experimenting with bottom layers shows that modifying latent codes only at layout-relevant layers changes layout without impacting other semantics, confirming the emergence of semantic hierarchy."
