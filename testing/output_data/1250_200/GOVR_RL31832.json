    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. The EAA provides authority for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the EAA. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) provides authority for export controls on dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. The regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the Department of Commerce. The EAA focuses on regulating exports of civilian goods and technology with military applications, but there is debate over the need to liberalize export regulations for American companies to compete internationally. Some argue that liberalization may pose threats to U.S. national security. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) authorizes export controls on dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. The act has evolved over the 20th century, addressing issues such as the Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and the maintenance of export controls under IEEPA. It discusses controlled commodities and debates on technology controllability, multilateral control regimes, organization of the export control system, and the impact on the U.S. economy and business. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with concerns over national security threats and the need for careful consideration of further liberalization. The Export Control Act of 1949 was enacted in response to the new security threat posed by the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls to prevent the export of scarce goods, foreign policy controls to promote U.S. foreign policy interests, and national security controls to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance military capability. This marked a shift towards a more extensive peacetime export control system. The Export Control Act of 1949 established security controls to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance military capability. CoCom was established in 1949 to coordinate multilateral export controls with NATO allies. The Act was renewed multiple times until the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\" in the late 1960s prompted a reexamination and revision of the export control system. In the late 1960s, the U.S. export control system underwent a serious reexamination and revision due to the onset of the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\". The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the near-embargo characteristic of the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. Subsequent renewals in 1974 and 1977, along with a comprehensive rewrite in 1979, formed the basis of the current export control system. Amendments in 1985 and moderate liberalization followed, with further streamlining under the George H.W. Bush Administration. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a significant change in the external threat faced by the United States. The export control system has been streamlined under the George H.W. Bush Administration, but there are calls for revamping the Export Administration Act to enhance exports, focus on current security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 changed the export control environment. Questions arise about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has not agreed on measures to reform the Export Administration Act, leading to temporary extensions and the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Export Administration Act was extended multiple times through temporary measures and Executive Orders, with debates on the effectiveness of operating under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Efforts to reform the Act have been ongoing, with legislation introduced in Congress, including the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 (H.R. 361) after hearings by various committees. In the following Congresses, export control legislation was introduced but no significant action was taken. Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 1999 in the 106th Congress, which was unanimously voted by the Senate Banking Committee but faced concerns about national security. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) with hearings held by the Senate. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate and passed with amendments. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman with additional provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. It was passed by the House International Relations Committee with amendments. In the 107th Congress, the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments. HASC further amended and reported out the legislation, while HPSCI held hearings but did not alter it. The Administration supported S. 149 and opposed House attempts to revise it. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55) identical to S. 149, but no action was taken. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 containing provisions related to dual-use export controls. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) were the focus of provisions in response to a DOD study. The House NDAA report expressed concerns about potential military embargoes on China and the transfer of U.S. goods or technology. However, these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in October 2004. In response to concerns about military embargoes on China and technology transfer, provisions were proposed regarding the Export Administration Regulations and Militarily Critical Technology List. However, these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in October 2004. Legislation introduced in subsequent Congresses aimed to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. Despite bipartisan support for targeted changes, comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA did not pass in subsequent Congresses. The Act aimed to enhance export control enforcement and penalties, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. Legislation was introduced in Congress, with only one bill being acted upon. Representative Sherman later introduced the Export Control Improvements Act containing provisions on export enforcement, data integration, and diversion control. The Export Control Improvements Act introduced by Representative Sherman focuses on enhancing export control enforcement, integrating export control data, and addressing diversion concerns. It grants investigative authority to relevant departments and agencies, allows for search and seizure of goods, and provides guidelines for best practices in export control. The bill authorizes search, detention, and seizures at U.S. ports of entry and overseas, updates guidelines for export control compliance programs, and integrates licensing requirements into the Automated Export System. It also addresses evasion of export controls through diversion of sensitive goods. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, first surfaced in 2006. The BIS proposed a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, but no country was designated. H.R. 3515 aims to legislate the 'Category C' concept with regards to diversion to Iran. The bill aims to establish a 'Category C' concept for countries of diversion concern with regards to Iran. Countries could be designated as possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns, with different requirements for each designation. Countries of diversion concern would face additional licensing requirements and increased scrutiny. An annual report on transfers of U.S. technology to concerning countries would also be mandated. The legislation includes provisions for an annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries. President Obama initiated a review of the export control system, with Defense Secretary Gates proposing a 4-pronged approach for reform. This approach involves creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single integrated information technology system, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The administration's blueprint aims to create a single database of sanctioned and denied parties, establish a single enforcement coordination agency, and implement changes in three phases. The first phase involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and creating a tiered control structure. Phase II would implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists, leading to a significant reduction in license requirements. Certain items would be moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list, and unilateral controls on some items would be examined. The administration's blueprint for a new export control system involves moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list, establishing a single licensing agency, merging control lists, and consolidating enforcement activities. Secretary Gates predicts a 3-phase plan unfolding over the next year, with some proposals requiring legislative action. The administration's plan for a new export control system includes moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list, establishing a single licensing agency, merging control lists, and consolidating enforcement activities. Legislative consent may be required to change the structure of control lists in Phase II, with potential placement of the licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity. Key principles include types of export controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures under IEEPA authority. The 1949 Act established U.S. dual-use export controls based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. National security control items require licenses reviewed case-by-case, with Country Group D-1 as the list of controlled countries. The list \"Country Group D-1\" serves as the controlled countries list for items reviewed on a case-by-case basis for national security purposes. The Secretary of Defense identifies goods and technology for control, periodically reviewed and revised by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce. Items not covered by U.S. national security controls are controlled for foreign policy purposes. Items controlled for national security are subject to foreign availability determination. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and other appropriate agencies, with determining on a continuing basis whether any item currently subject to export control for reasons of national security meets foreign availability status. If a foreign availability determination is made, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President determines that decontrolling such items would be detrimental to national security. In that case, negotiations with multilateral control partners are required to eliminate the availability in question. The 1979 Act directs the President to enter negotiations with multilateral control partners if decontrolling items subject to export control would be detrimental to national security. The bill also established the Office of Foreign Availability, which no longer exists, and the Office of Technology Evaluation now handles foreign availability determinations. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was created in 2008 to assist in determining technologies for the control list. BIS conducts regular reviews of the CCL to streamline and protect technologies for national security reasons. BIS conducted a review of the CCL in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of it each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS lifted certain licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities. Export controls were tightened on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Some concerns remain about the time taken to resolve the issue. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress. Mass market status was defined to apply to items produced or made available for sale in large volume or to multiple buyers. Criteria for determining mass market status included the item's manner of distribution, conduciveness to commercial shipping, and usefulness for intended purposes without modification. This feature was controversial and cited as a stumbling block in negotiations over the bill in the 107th Congress. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, or deterring and punishing. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, or deterring and punishing terrorism. Foreign policy controls are in place for various purposes such as anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, United Nations sanctions, unilateral embargoes, non-proliferation objectives, and adherence to multilateral agreements on chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and missile technology. The EAA imposes limitations on the use of foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal, clear objectives and criteria reporting to Congress, negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, and compliance with international obligations. Licenses are required for exporting certain items to countries supporting terrorism. The Export Administration Act authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, terrorism deterrence, and international obligations. Licenses are required for exporting certain items to countries supporting terrorism. Foreign policy controls also apply to sales of medicine, medical supplies, food, and agricultural products. Catch-all controls require a license for export of any item if it will be used for proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security maintains an end-user list subject to these controls. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The 1979 Export Administration Act (EAA) authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry. Few short-supply controls remain, including restrictions on crude oil and horses by sea. BIS reviewed 21,213 license applications in FY2008 totaling $72.1 billion, including licenses for crude oil exports and dual-use technology. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion, including licenses for crude oil exports and dual-use technology. China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. The CCL, created under the 1979 EAA, includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply. The Commerce Control List (CCL) is a list of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). It consists of ten categories, each further divided into functional groups, with each item assigned an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). There are about 500 ECCN listings, each accompanied by a description and reason for control. The Commerce Control List (CCL) consists of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), with each item assigned an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). Nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the EAR, allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, but some products may still require a license due to high diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, dictating the regulatory regime. The Commerce Control List (CCL) assigns Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) to goods, technology, and software under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, dictating the regulatory regime. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the Department of State determines CJs. Some exporters seek BIS commodity classification for less restrictive controls. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referrals of classification requests to State and Defense. In 2008, the GAO highlighted jurisdictional disagreements between the State and Defense departments, leading to minimal coordination and differing interpretations of regulations. Despite recommendations, the departments have not resolved these disputes or improved coordination, leaving exporters to determine restrictions and review processes. The Export Administration Regulations establish procedures for license application review and interagency dispute resolution, but current procedures have not been updated since 1995. The current procedures for resolving interagency disputes regarding export licenses were established by Executive Order 12981 in 1995. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies having the ability to review licenses as well. The Secretary must take specific actions within nine days of a license application's registration, and agencies must request additional information within specific timeframes. The procedures have not been updated since 1995. The agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days, providing justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days means no objection. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism, with the Export Administration Review Board at the top tier. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) oversees the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), which includes the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration as Chair. The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, handles dispute resolution. Departments can appeal decisions to ACEP and then to the Secretary within specific timeframes. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) oversees the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) and handles dispute resolution. An appeal process allows for challenges to decisions within specific timeframes. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific considerations for reconsideration. Foreign availability assessment can be a basis for appeal, potentially leading to a reversal of a license denial. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the Operating Committee (OC) and 20 were examined by ACEP. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the Operating Committee (OC) and 20 were examined by the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Controls were reinstated in 1994 after temporary extensions of the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired. President Clinton signed legislation in 2000 to extend the authority of the 1979 Act until 2001. Several deficiencies have been noted in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority, including lapses in police power of enforcement agents, complications in obtaining Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status, lack of authorization to limit federal court jurisdiction, absence of explicit confidentiality provisions for export license applications, and inability to implement provisions to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. The United States has been criticized for not enacting appropriate legislation to strengthen export control laws, which diminishes its credibility. However, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million and civil penalties to $250,000. This act aims to deter violations involving national security controls. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties for security controls and criminal violations to $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals and $1 million or 5 times the value of exports for firms. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional attention has focused on technologically advanced computers, including supercomputers and HPCs, which can perform complex digital operations within seconds. The Wassenaar Arrangement introduced a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) in 2006, measured in weighted teraflops (WT), to calculate computing power. The control level is set at 0.75 WT for high-end proprietary HPCs used by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. This replaces the previous benchmark of 190,000 MTOPS from 2002. The level for computer software and technology is set at 0.04 WT, and for computer development and production technology at 0.1 WT. Export restrictions on HPCs have been debated due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and foreign availability of comparable models. HPC export thresholds have been raised over time, with the last change in January 2002 raising the threshold to 190,000 MTOPS for Tier 3 countries. This decontrol process has significantly impacted BIS regulations. In 1993, there were over 11,000 license applications for computer assemblies and hardware, which dropped to 14 in 2003. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. This Act imposes special conditions on the export of high-performance computers, including prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries, post-shipment verification requirements, and notification to Congress of any adjustments in threshold levels. The EAA in the 107th Congress aimed to repeal these NDAA98 provisions. Encryption involves encoding electronic messages for transfer. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure transfer. Keys are needed to decode the message. It is crucial for e-commerce security and cryptography, impacting military code-breaking capabilities. Control authority of encryption technology was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users with certain restrictions. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology, including materials and designs to evade electronic detection, falls into two categories: deflecting radar signals or absorbing them. Export control concerns arise due to civil applications of stealth materials, leading to reclassification as munitions in the 1990s. Congress debates the strictness of controlling exports of commercial satellites and effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosure of missile secrets. The Cox Committee in 1998 found that U.S. satellite manufacturers shared missile design information with China through improper transfer of launch failure analysis. Congress transferred authority to license exports of commercial communications satellites from the Department of Commerce to the Department of State in March 1999. The satellite industry argues that this has led to licensing delays and lost sales, lobbying to reverse export controls to Commerce. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The U.S. Munitions List controls technologies related to satellite systems and manufacturing equipment for missiles and aircraft engines. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 allowed for the transfer of commercial satellite components from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls on sales of manufacturing equipment, particularly regarding China. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrolling certain machine tools due to foreign availability in China and Taiwan. The technology assessment recommended decontrol of 5-axis machine tools for China and Taiwan. Concerns were raised in Congress about decontrolling hot section technology used in jet aircraft production. The civilian aviation industry is worried about DDTC's jurisdiction over aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA addresses standard equipment certification. The EAA asserts jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components, specifically addressing standard equipment certification. Commercial suppliers have raised concerns about DDTC's jurisdiction over non-FAA components. Legislation has been introduced to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for FAA approval is subject only to controls under the EAA. The new rule clarifies that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and covered by an FAA type certificate. Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for a commodity jurisdiction determination. Deemed exports of technology to foreign nationals in the US are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. Deemed exports involve transferring technology to foreign nationals in the US, requiring a license if the same transfer to their home country would need one. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) reviews deemed export license applications, with a significant number for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule in 2005 to determine which foreign nationals are subject to export controls based on their country of birth. In 2005, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) established rules for deemed export controls based on country of birth. In 2007, the Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for streamlined application processes, evaluating applicant loyalties based on various factors. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended streamlining regulations and establishing an expert panel for annual technology reviews. Industry criticized the proposals as unmanageable. BIS sought input on technology scope and country affiliation criteria. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration debates. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration debates. Reform of export control is debated from business and national security perspectives, with controversies arising over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing process, and economic impact. Issues include effective controls on potential exports to countries threatening US security, terrorists, human rights violators, and weapons proliferators. The EAA debate revolves around the foreign availability and mass market provisions, questioning the controllability of technology and the impact on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support these provisions, arguing that unilateral controls are ineffective in preventing other countries from obtaining advanced technology. They believe that only American businesses suffer from U.S. export controls, while foreign businesses gain new markets or incentives. Unilateral export controls are seen as ineffective, benefiting foreign businesses by opening new markets. The current system is challenged by globalization as component parts are sourced globally. Concerns are raised about the impact of mass market and foreign availability arguments on the U.S. control regime. Critics argue that the mass market standard could undermine the entire control system. Critics argue that the mass market standard could nullify the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items meeting certain criteria, potentially allowing proliferation items to qualify. Industry advocates for robust export industries to enhance national security, citing the shift towards commercial applications in defense procurement. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as hindering American firms with export controls could allow foreign firms to surpass our technological lead. Critics disagree, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could backfire, citing the example of U.S. weaponry ending up being used against allies in the past. In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein was seen as a counterweight to Iran, but later used technology against Kuwait in the Gulf War. R&D reliance on the civilian sector is due to declining defense budgets. Some argue defense R&D should be funded within the Defense Department to control technology exports. The rapid rise in computing power shows the export control system's inability to keep up with innovation. Attempting to control computing power is deemed ineffective and self-defeating, as it hinders market opportunities for R&D. The distinction between super-computers and commodity computers has blurred due to increasing computing speeds and networking advances. The ability to cluster commodity computers to create servers with high computing power erodes export control restrictions. American-made computers are perceived as superior, offering better networking and service. Networking a parallel processing system can increase computing capabilities. Control advocates believe limiting exports can restrict access to advanced computing technology. Export control restrictions are challenged by clustering commodity computers for high computing power. Networking parallel processing systems can boost computing capabilities, posing unique challenges for those without advanced technology access. Post-shipment verification is used to monitor end-use of controlled goods, especially for high-performance computers exported to tier III destinations like China, Russia, and India. Concerns have been raised about limited efforts to monitor compliance with export licenses, particularly in China where state-owned enterprises have close ties. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These regimes involve national discretion, a common control list, and regular reporting requirements for controlling exports of goods under national laws. Unlike the Cold War era CoCom, these regimes focus on monitoring end-use of controlled goods, especially high-performance computers exported to countries like China, Russia, and India. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral export control regimes involve national discretion, a common control list, and reporting requirements. These organizations pledge disclosure and consultation on export licensing decisions but operate by consensus, which some critics find ineffective. Industry representatives emphasize the need for effective multilateral controls to ensure all states adhere to export regulations. Industry representatives stress the importance of effective multilateral controls for export regulations, particularly criticizing the unilateral nature of current export policies towards China. They argue that stringent domestic controls combined with minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies and call for a strategy to convince allies to follow suit. Proponents of tighter export restrictions highlight America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts, emphasizing the need to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement to prevent proliferation effectively. The original EAA was adopted in 1949, leading to the establishment of CoCom. Efforts to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement require the US to lead by example in tightening export restrictions. Industry and advocates agree on the need for stronger multilateral controls, but consensus is lacking on which countries pose a threat. The export control dilemma arises without agreement on specific target countries. The export control dilemma in the context of U.S. policy towards China revolves around balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and hinder technology transfers, leading to missed business opportunities. The challenge lies in benefiting from the Chinese market while minimizing security risks associated with exporting sensitive technologies. The U.S. faces challenges in balancing economic benefits with national security risks in its policy towards China. Concerns have been raised about Chinese companies bypassing U.S. export controls, leading to technology transfer issues. The need for tightened controls and enforcement against China has been emphasized due to findings of illegal technology acquisitions and proliferation activities. In response, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published a final rule in 2007 to revise and clarify export controls for China. The final rule published by BIS in 2007 introduced new controls for certain products for military end-use in China, a VEU program, and a requirement for an end-user statement. The new controls aim to address concerns about technology exports undermining the arms embargo on China. The establishment of new military end-use controls on 20 product categories has been a focal point, requiring licenses for exports to China. The final rule by BIS introduces controls for items with military end-uses in China, requiring a license if intended for military purposes in the PRC. There is a presumption of denial for items contributing to PRC's military capabilities in key weapons systems. The rule also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from MOFCOM. The final rule by BIS introduces controls for items with military end-uses in China, requiring a license if intended for military purposes in the PRC. The rule increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from MOFCOM to $50,000 for most goods, but expands the requirement to cover all license applications reaching this threshold. The VEU component allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. China's Minister of Foreign Commerce (MoFCom) announced that companies seeking VEU status must obtain authorization from MoFCom for plant or records inspections. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program, with items controlled for crime control or missile technology not qualifying. The approved VEU can import items from any exporter and the list of approved items can be adjusted by the ERC. The VEU program allows for the export of approved items to end-users, with the list expandable or contractible by the ERC. General Electric India was the first eligible company in India, and five companies were announced as VEUs in 2007. These companies imported goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their government affiliations. The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC's diversion risks due to their government affiliations and past violations of U.S. sanctions. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies' use of U.S. technology. The GAO recommended suspending the VEU program with China due to the lack of inspection agreements and criteria for on-site reviews. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is responsible for regulating dual-use exports. The VEU program with China lacks inspection agreements and criteria for on-site reviews, according to the GAO. Concerns have been raised about AVIC I and HHNEC's diversion risks due to their government affiliations and past violations of U.S. sanctions. Representative Markey cited information about Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies in the licensing process. The Department of Defense conducts national security reviews for license applications, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have identified issues with overlapping jurisdiction between the Commerce and State Departments for certain dual-use products. The existing licensing system for dual-use products faces challenges such as overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments, extended approval times, outdated technology considerations, and lack of judicial review. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough and fair license reviews, requiring time to check items against controlled lists and coordinate with multiple agencies. Officials in agencies like BIS must have the ability to pause the approval process to investigate and ensure sensitive technologies are not misused. Some question if BIS, under the Department of Commerce, is biased towards granting export licenses over national security concerns. However, others argue that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense prevents such bias."
