    "content": "Cybercrime is on the rise, with data breaches exposing millions of personal financial records. The average cost of a cybercrime incident in FY2014 was $12.7 million. The global economy loses about $445 billion to cybercrime annually. The risks to critical infrastructure and national security from cyberattacks are significant. Increasing cybersecurity is a priority for President Obama and some Members of Congress. Sharing information about cyberattacks could help companies improve their cybersecurity at a low cost. Sharing information about cyberattacks can help improve cybersecurity at a low cost. The costs of a data breach can be significant, including detection, containment, repair, incident response, investigation, fraud losses, and lost sales. Joining a specialized sharing organization to share information is estimated to cost less than $100,000. Misaligned incentives hinder information sharing about cyberattacks. After a cyberattack, companies may notify law enforcement, other companies, customers, and stockholders. Certain regulated companies may be required to notify regulators of cyberattacks. Notification to law enforcement is done in the hope of bringing perpetrators to justice and recovering losses, while sharing information with other companies aims to enhance security. Customers are informed to prevent financial fraud, and public companies notify stockholders. Greater information sharing improves security, with customers notified to monitor financial information and prevent fraud. The SEC mandates publicly traded companies to disclose information affecting investors. The report analyzes government-private, private-private information sharing, focusing on cybersecurity economic incentives. Companies facing breaches like credit card theft do not bear full costs, as retailers face chargebacks and card issuers are not fully compensated. Consumers must monitor accounts and update bill payments to prevent cyberattacks. Software companies balance benefits of delays for improvement. To enhance cybersecurity, companies should prioritize information sharing among individuals, organizations, and governments. Sharing specific attack detection methods, recovery procedures, and general hardware/software information can significantly improve security. Despite potential costs, the benefits of information sharing are substantial, as emphasized by the White House cybersecurity coordinator. Information sharing is crucial for effective cybersecurity, as emphasized by the White House cybersecurity coordinator. Legislation has been introduced to promote information sharing in Congress. Organizations can learn about breaches from third parties like law enforcement. Sharing information can help in identifying cyber attackers and improving cybersecurity arrangements. Sharing information can also lead to collaboration with security consultants or software developers for better defense measures. Sharing cybersecurity information with competitors can be risky as it may reveal security lessons learned at great expense. Publicly disclosing a cyber breach can potentially scare customers away to competitors, leading to reduced revenue and stock price declines. Companies in 47 states and territories may be required to notify consumers of breaches involving personally identifiable information. Some argue that public disclosure can tip off attackers or be a waste of time if information is breached but not stolen. Industry participants and observers generally agree on the importance of information sharing for cybersecurity. Outfitters argue that public disclosure can alert attackers or be a waste of time if information is breached but not stolen. There is a lack of optimal information sharing about cyber attacks. While sharing information can be challenging, it has proven to enhance security. However, most details about breaches are disclosed by third-party experts rather than the affected firms. Firms are hesitant to share information due to concerns about privacy, antitrust laws, and exposing proprietary business information. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has provided guidance that cybersecurity information sharing is not considered anticompetitive behavior. However, concerns remain about firms holding back information that could enhance cybersecurity. Some argue that unresolved legal questions surrounding privacy and antitrust issues hinder information sharing. Organizations may be reluctant to help competitors and may not reciprocate sharing efforts. Some organizations are hesitant to share cybersecurity information due to concerns about free-riding and potential negative impacts if the shared information is breached. Public disclosure of breaches can lead to loss of customers, sales, and affect stock prices. Despite fears being exaggerated, evidence suggests that these concerns are the main barriers to information sharing. Target's stock price increased after a data breach, while competitors like Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco experienced declines. The Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) Council highlighted the challenges of discerning the benefits of sharing information compared to the direct risks and costs involved. The ISAC Council emphasized to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) the challenges of discerning the benefits of sharing cybersecurity information compared to the direct risks and costs involved. Information technology executives worry about data breaches leading to loss in consumer confidence and revenue decline. Companies may not share cybersecurity information due to concerns about free-riding, potential negative impacts, and the uncertainty of reputational benefits. Some cyberattacks are seen as a cost of doing business, similar to shoplifting. Firms may develop custom countermeasures if the threat is significant, but may not share information if there are no financial incentives or competitive concerns. Industries with similar products and technologies could benefit from sharing information, but competitive pressures may hinder collaboration. Firms must weigh the competitive advantage of a countermeasure against selling or sharing it. Some firms may choose to sell cybersecurity services as a countermeasure, while others may not have the capability to do so. Organizations often hesitate to share information to maintain their competitive advantage. However, some may share information to build a reputation as a good corporate citizen or prioritize national security and economic growth over immediate economic gains. External experts are often called in to investigate and remediate data breaches. When organizations experience a data breach, they may call in outside experts to investigate and remediate the breach. The consultants negotiate contract terms with the organization, keeping the details confidential. These experts may gather detailed technical information on breaches, which can be used to prevent future breaches at other clients. Cyberinsurance companies also play a role in assessing cybersecurity practices and conducting investigations after a breach claim. Legislation has been introduced to encourage information sharing among organizations. The curr_chunk discusses how organizations share information to prevent cyber threats, including new threat types, best practices, and attack effects. It mentions automatic sharing of certain information, like malware detection alerts. The chunk also highlights Target's 2013 data breach and the decision to disable automatic malware deletion in their security system. The security team at Target disabled a function, with a chief information security officer explaining that it is common for security teams to have the final decision. Machine autonomy has limitations, as machines are not as adept as humans in identifying sensitive information. Effective machine-to-machine sharing requires high levels of trust and technical expertise. Different sectors, such as private and public, share information differently. Government contractors may have stricter information sharing requirements, with the Department of Defense mandating reporting of potential classified information breaches. Critical infrastructure industries operate uniquely in information sharing practices. ISACs, created in 1998, are private-sector entities that collect and share cybersecurity information among critical infrastructure industries and other sectors. They facilitate anonymous information sharing between members and the government, aiding in rapid communication during emergencies. Some ISAC-like entities, such as the Financial Sector Cyber Intelligence Group, also exist. The Food ISAC, classified as critical infrastructure, ceased operations due to a lack of information sharing. The Food ISAC, classified as critical infrastructure, ceased operations due to a lack of information sharing. The Multi-State ISAC includes all 50 states, four U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and many local governments. The electricity sector ISAC, run by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, counts virtually all registered electricity providers as members. Membership in ISACs is voluntary, with varying levels of participation. The FS-ISAC offers membership tiers ranging from free to platinum, with costs up to $49,950 annually. This has not equalized participation rates among firms with varying resources. New York State found that 60% of large banking organizations and 25% of small organizations were members of the FS-ISAC. The FS-ISAC has helped members combat cybersecurity issues like denial-of-service attacks. The IT-ISAC has 33 members, including large cybersecurity vendors. ISACs cannot prevent free-riding, which may discourage information sharing. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose cybersecurity risks. The SEC mandates publicly traded companies to disclose \"material information\" related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Supreme Court defines material information as having the potential to significantly impact investors' decision-making. There is a debate on the timing of information disclosure, as cybersecurity breaches often require extensive investigation. Some experts advocate for mandatory sharing of certain information to enhance cybersecurity measures. Some experts advocate for mandatory sharing of cybersecurity information to enhance security measures. Geer proposes a model based on the aviation industry and the Center for Disease Control for reporting incidents. Inadequate information sharing can lead to suboptimal security and lower the market for cybersecurity products. Cybersecurity products face challenges similar to the \"market for lemons\" concept, where buyers struggle to assess product value accurately. This leads to underinvestment in product development, resulting in fewer high-quality options for buyers. The difficulty in determining a security product's effectiveness contributes to a lack of confidence in the market, potentially leading to reduced cybersecurity investment. Sharing more information in the cybersecurity market can reduce information asymmetries, increase market size and quality, and make cyberspace more secure. Clear metrics of effectiveness and third-party evaluation services are lacking. Information sharing is most beneficial for organizations using similar technologies, but there is a risk of erroneous information leading to new security holes. Greater information sharing in the cybersecurity market can enhance security measures, but there are concerns about the potential for erroneous information leading to new security vulnerabilities. The reputation of information providers can offer assurance that experts have reviewed the information. The Federal Trade Commission's authority to sue companies for deceptive practices serves as an enforcement mechanism for cybersecurity standards. However, there is a need for clear metrics of effectiveness and third-party evaluation services to ensure uniform security practices among organizations. ISACs can help analyze and filter relevant information for their members to prevent information overload and maintain focus on critical alerts. ISACs play a crucial role in analyzing and sorting relevant information for their members to prevent information overload. Greater information sharing in the cybersecurity market could boost the $1.3 billion cyberinsurance industry by improving risk assessment and security product effectiveness. A mature cyberinsurance market promotes safer practices, reducing insurers' payouts. However, cyberinsurance may have limited utility due to intangible losses like damage to reputation. Two bills in the 114th Congress aim to impact organizations' willingness to share cybersecurity information. On April 22, 2015, the House passed H.R. 1560, Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), and on April 23, 2015, it passed H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 (NCPA). H.R. 1560 authorizes voluntary sharing of cybersecurity information between the federal government and nonfederal entities. H.R. 1731 addresses cybersecurity protection advancement. H.R. 1560 authorizes voluntary sharing of cybersecurity information between the federal government and nonfederal entities, including small businesses and financial institutions. It preempts laws that could require disclosure of shared information and protects nonfederal entities from legal action for sharing information, except in cases of willful misconduct. The bill allows nonfederal entities to share cybersecurity information without violating antitrust laws. The bill allows two or more nonfederal entities to share cybersecurity information without violating antitrust laws. Title I amends the National Security Act of 1947, while Title II amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Differences exist in responsibilities and definitions between the two titles. S. 754, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, authorizes voluntary information sharing between the federal government and nonfederal entities, prohibiting the government from making sharing a condition for receiving information. S. 754, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, requires the federal government to share information without compromising security, privacy, and civil liberties. It assigns the lead responsibility for information sharing to the Director of National Intelligence and allows nonfederal entities to share cybersecurity information without violating antitrust laws. The bill aims to encourage information sharing and prohibits the government from making sharing a condition for receiving information. The proposed bills, H.R. 1560 and S. 754, aim to facilitate cybersecurity information sharing between federal and nonfederal entities. They include provisions to protect shared information from disclosure, limit its use to cybersecurity and serious crimes, and ensure that sharing does not violate antitrust laws. While these measures may encourage more information sharing, some nonfederal entities may adopt a cautious approach to see how the provisions are implemented. The bills H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to increase cybersecurity information sharing without significantly raising costs. They do not address competitive incentives for sharing but could lead to the development of informal sharing networks. Nonfederal entities, especially businesses, will need to weigh the benefits of sharing information against the costs. Membership costs for ISAOs or ISACs are not addressed by the bills. The bills H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to increase cybersecurity information sharing without significantly raising costs. Businesses must consider the benefits of sharing information against the expensive membership costs of ISAOs or ISACs. Recent events, such as the resignations of CEOs at Target and Sony Entertainment, may change attitudes towards data breaches."
