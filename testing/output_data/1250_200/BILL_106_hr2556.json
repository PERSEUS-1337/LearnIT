    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for air quality improvement through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. Participating employers are those who allow and engage in telecommuting voluntarily. The term \"participating employers\" refers to those who voluntarily authorize telecommuting. Telecommuting involves using telecommunications to work, reducing the need to commute. Regulated entities are those under the Clean Air Act for ozone precursor emissions. Ozone precursors are pollutants leading to ground-level ozone. VMTs stand for vehicle-miles-traveled. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for reducing ozone precursor emissions. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors resulting from reduced VMTs by telecommuting employees. Employers can transfer emission credits to others, and a trading forum will be available for exchanging these credits with regulated entities. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors resulting from reduced VMTs by telecommuting employees. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through direct trades and exchanges, and present them to the Federal Government or State for compliance. The Federal Government will explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and entities in different geographic areas. The Secretary will select geographic areas for a pilot program to promote telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMTs). Grantees must consult with local governments and business organizations in the selected areas. A study and report on the potential impact of the program on expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs must be submitted to Congress and the Secretary. The pilot program aims to promote telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) in selected geographic areas. The program would have positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. $250,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2000."
