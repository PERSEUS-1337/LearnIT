    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests. Congress delayed passing appropriations bills, including State-Foreign Operations, until after the fall elections, eventually passing a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government until March 27, 2013. The House later passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The Senate approved an expanded version of the bill on March 20, 2013, and it was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The State-Foreign Operations appropriation supports international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, State Department operations, and international broadcasting. The bill does not cover food aid or certain international commissions. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military bill on March 26, 2013. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution, P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013, funding State-Foreign operations accounts at the FY2012-enacted level. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, H.J.Res. 117, funded the government until March 27, 2013, with a 0.612% increase for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, providing $52.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The House Appropriations Committee approved its bill totaling $48.5 billion, 12% less than requested and 9% below FY2012 levels. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bills, with the House allocating $48.38 billion and the Senate allocating $53.02 billion. Both allocations were below the Administration's request, with the House being almost 12% below and the Senate being 3% below. The bills included Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The Obama Administration submitted its FY2013 budget request to Congress, seeking a 2.6% increase in funding for the Department of State-Foreign Operations. The total request was $54.9 billion, including $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Additionally, the Administration proposed a new bilateral economic aid account called the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) with $770 million in funds. The Administration requested $770 million for the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support Arab Spring countries. They also sought $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF), despite concerns about U.S.-Pakistan relations. The FY2013 request showed slight changes in funding distribution compared to FY2012. The State Department and Related Agencies portion of the international affairs budget request included funding for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, National Endowment for Democracy, and U.S. Institute of Peace. The Administration requested a 4.5% boost in FY2013 to a total of $18.8 billion for these accounts, with $14.1 billion allocated for Administration of Foreign Affairs. The FY2013 budget request for the State Department focused on supporting key efforts such as the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and ongoing State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department took over responsibilities from the U.S. military forces in Iraq, ranging from air transport to medical services. The FY2013 budget request for the State Department included $2.7 billion for State Operations in Iraq, reflecting a 23% decrease from FY2012. The funding decrease aimed to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence in Iraq, with cost-saving measures such as reducing staff presence, security contracts, and construction completion. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, including increased security for staff. The appropriations bill included $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with funding for increased security but not for increased staff. The FY2013 budget request reflected reforms outlined in the QDDR, including the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. The FY2013 budget request included increased funding for the State Department's operations in support of the Counterterrorism mission, with a $2.4 million increase for the new Bureau of Counterterrorism. The Bureau of Energy Resources also sought additional funding for 22 new positions to strengthen its capacity. Neither the House nor Senate bill mentioned the Bureau of Counterterrorism, but funding could still be provided for new hires within the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested an additional $5.4 million to strengthen market incentives and expand energy expertise. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not mention the Bureau. The Administration also requested increased funding for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) received a $56.5 million budget increase in FY2013, with a focus on restructuring for greater agility and expeditionary capabilities. Staffing levels were reduced by 64 positions to create a more flexible response capacity with less overhead. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) model was also modified to fund experts only when deployed, resulting in a reduction of 76 members from the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee continued to provide authority for fund transfers, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not allocate specific funding for CSO. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposal for FY2013 included no funding for Conflict and Stabilization Operations, but authorized transferring $56.5 million from Diplomatic & Consular Program funding. The Administration requested an additional $10 million from the Complex Crisis Fund. The Administration's FY2013 request for human resources included $2.5 billion, with $24.9 million to increase State's staffing by 121 new positions. Secretary Clinton aimed to increase Foreign Service Officers by 25% from 2008 to 2014, with 18% growth achieved by FY2013 through hiring 82 FSOs and 39 civil servants. The Administration's FY2013 request included funding for additional Foreign Service Officers and civil servants, aiming for a 25% growth in the Foreign Service. The request also included $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs, addressing previous pay differentials and recruitment challenges. Congress had approved prior OCP adjustments, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. Congress approved two prior OCP adjustments since 2009, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring comparability pay level to the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include funding for hiring above attrition or overseas comparability pay authority in their FY2013 proposals. In October 2011, UNESCO voted to admit Palestine as a full member, sparking a U.S. policy debate on Palestinian statehood. The United States has long opposed Palestinian statehood outside of a negotiated agreement with Israel. U.S. law prohibits funding to any U.N. agency accepting Palestinians as full members. U.S. contributions to UNESCO have been withheld since Palestine's admission. The Administration sought $80 million for UNESCO in 2012, with plans to work with Congress for a waiver. The House committee report stated it would withhold U.S. contributions to UNESCO and prohibit Economic Support Funds to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full U.N. membership. The Senate legislation did not recommend funding for UNESCO within the CIO account, as it is prohibited by law. It also included restrictions on U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting full membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals included less funding than requested for the International Organizations and Programs account. The Foreign Operations budget comprises the majority of U.S. foreign assistance programs, managed primarily by USAID and the State Department. The Foreign Operations budget, totaling $36.07 billion for FY2013, includes funding for various foreign assistance agencies and multilateral financial institutions. It also supports initiatives like the Global Health Initiative and the Global Climate Change Initiative. The FY2013 Foreign Operations budget includes funding for foreign assistance initiatives like the Global Health Initiative, Food Security Initiative, and Global Climate Change Initiative. There is also funding for war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as a new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. Congressional debate focuses on funding levels, policy issues like restrictions on international family planning programs, and aid conditions for certain countries and entities. The use of foreign assistance as a democracy promotion tool is under scrutiny due to recent uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. In North Africa, foreign assistance for democracy promotion is scrutinized after the fall of regimes in Egypt and Libya. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in FY2013 to support political transitions. This fund would include $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative and $5 million for regional activities. The remaining $700 million would be unallocated. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in FY2013 to support political transitions, with $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative and $5 million for regional activities. The remaining $700 million would have been unallocated funds for humanitarian relief, peacekeeping activities, or loan forgiveness, with concerns raised about giving the Administration too much discretion and Congress too little oversight. The House committee bill did not provide funding for a new account but allocated $175 million within the Economic Support Fund and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for the Middle East. The House committee bill allocated $175 million in the Economic Support Fund and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for the Middle East, with $50 million for Jordan and $75 million unallocated. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, increasing MEPI funding to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan are top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to these countries in FY2013, with $2.1 billion for Iraq, including $1 billion for the Police Development Program. In FY2013, $1.8 billion was designated for Iraq, with $1 billion allocated for the Police Development Program (PDP). The PDP was described as a vital part of U.S.-Iraqi relationship, despite doubts about its efficacy. The House legislation expressed support for the PDP but did not provide specific funds for Iraq. The House report expressed support for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq but did not allocate specific funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the PDP due to perceived lack of success and poor planning. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with a significant portion designated for infrastructure and justice sector programs. The House legislation did not specify total funding for Afghanistan. The House legislation for Afghanistan did not specify total funding and required security certification for aid workers. The Senate bill allocated $1.8 billion for Afghanistan, citing reduced funding needs as the Afghan government takes control of more programs. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion for Pakistan, with a focus on civilian assistance for energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. The House legislation did not specify aid levels for Pakistan, linking assistance to cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill for Pakistan included $842.3 million in foreign operations funds, with new conditions on aid including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released. The budget request for the Administration's Global Health Initiative was roughly $7.9 billion, a decrease of $300.0 million from the previous year. The budget request for the Administration's Global Health Initiative was approximately $7.9 billion, with a $300.0 million cut being the largest reduction requested. The request included decreases for most global health activities, except for an increase in funding for international family planning and the Global Fund. The House and Senate proposed more funding than the request, with the Senate proposing $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative. The FY2013 budget request included $1.7 billion for the Global Fund and $1.1 billion for Feed the Future initiative. The House proposal supported Feed the Future goals without specifying funding levels, while the Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security programs, including $200 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The FY2013 budget request included $770 million for programs supporting the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI), with funds flowing through various appropriations accounts. The initiative focuses on climate change activities such as adaptation, clean energy technologies, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. A significant portion of funding would go through World Bank Trust Funds, leveraging contributions from other donor countries and sources. The House and Senate had differing positions on GCCI in their FY2013 proposals. The House legislation recommended zero funding for the Clean Technology Fund and Strategic Climate Fund, while providing half of the requested funds for the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The Senate committee recommended $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes, a pillar of the GCCI, and strong support for multilateral climate change funds, exceeding the Administration's request. Congressional debate focuses on family planning and reproductive health activities, with contentious issues surrounding the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA). Recent congressional debate revolves around two key issues: the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The Mexico City policy, established in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by past administrations. The UNFPA has faced suspension of grants due to alleged coercive family planning practices in China. Past and current administrations have disagreed on UNFPA's involvement in such activities. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009, and requested $39 million for UNFPA for FY2013. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities and prohibited funding for UNFPA, while the Senate legislation included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both the House and Senate bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration proposed that the AEECA account be dissolved in FY2013 to reflect the end of an era of special focus on former Soviet and Eastern bloc states transitioning to democracy and free market economies. The request included $420.9 million in funding for programs currently funded through AEECA, an 18% cut from FY2012 funding of $513.9 million. The House and Senate proposed merging AEECA funds with other accounts for FY2013, without specifying a minimum funding level for AEECA-eligible countries. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests drive international affairs activities, historically focused on anti-communism during the Cold War. Since the end of the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy objectives have shifted to focus on stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing illegal drug production, promoting peace in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering human trafficking. Following the 9/11 attacks, national security objectives became a priority in foreign aid and diplomatic programs, with an emphasis on countering terrorism. Global development was established as a key pillar of U.S. national security in 2002, alongside defense and diplomacy. The Bush Administration emphasized using foreign aid as a tool of national security, focusing on diplomatic security, public diplomacy in Muslim communities, combatting HIV/AIDS globally, and creating the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Obama Administration continued these efforts. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation, global health funding, and assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Reforms were made, such as naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance and implementing changes at the Department of State. The Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction was renamed to the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Department of State proposed using OCO funds for temporary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress expanded the OCO designation to include additional accounts and countries. OCO funds do not count towards budget caps, allowing war-related funding to coexist with core international affairs activities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that OCO funds are not exempt from BCA automatic reductions starting January 2, 2013. The use of supplemental international affairs appropriations for war activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere has been criticized by the Obama Administration. Base funding increased in FY2010, but supplemental funds were still requested for emergencies like the earthquake in Haiti. In FY2011, all international affairs funding was included in the base budget due to activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. For FY2013, $8.24 billion was requested as OCO, 5% less than FY2012. The House designated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate designated $2.3 billion, mainly excluding funding for the Iraq Police Development program. The Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion for OCO, 72% less than requested, with no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with reductions in FY2011 to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding leveled off due to deficit reduction efforts, below FY2009 levels after adjusting for inflation. Appropriations for State-Foreign Operations and related agencies over the past decade are shown in tables and figures. State Department and related agencies funding trends upward over the past decade, with a spike in foreign aid in 2004. State Department funding slightly increased that year as diplomacy funding lagged. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to increase human resource capacity at the Department of State. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, after typically going to Israel and Egypt before 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, Israel and Egypt have been top recipients of U.S. foreign aid. However, Iraq and Afghanistan moved into the top five due to reconstruction efforts. Pakistan has also received increased aid to combat extremist organizations. In FY2013, Israel received the most aid at $3,100 million, followed by Afghanistan and Pakistan. Iraq saw an increase in aid, ranking fourth in FY2013. In FY2013, U.S. foreign aid to Africa would have decreased by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion, mainly due to support for the Arab Spring. Aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6% to $5.3 billion, with 88% of the aid requested for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region's request was dominated by assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. The Western Hemisphere's decline was due to reduced funding for Colombia, and Europe and Eurasia saw a 14% decline in aid due to progress made by many countries in the region. In FY2013, U.S. foreign aid to Africa decreased by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East increased by 12% to $9.0 billion, mainly due to support for the Arab Spring. Aid to South Central Asia increased by 6% to $5.3 billion, with 88% of the aid requested for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The decline in aid to the Western Hemisphere was due to reduced funding for Colombia, and Europe and Eurasia saw a 14% decline in aid due to progress made by many countries in the region. The Administration's budget requests for key interest areas showed a decrease in FY2013 compared to FY2012 for most sectors. The Administration's FY2013 budget request showed declines in funding for key interest areas, including Food Security, Global Climate Change, Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. However, there was increased funding for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation compared to the previous year."
