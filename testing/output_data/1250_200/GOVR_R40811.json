    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Existing authorities for federal agencies are broad but lack sufficient reporting on funding and accomplishments for Congress to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Improved reporting on funding and results, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, may help Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. All biomass is potential fuel for wildfires, with some fires burning surface fuels while others become high-intensity conflagrations. Wildfires can vary in intensity, from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires that burn through the forest canopy. The behavior of a wildfire depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Efforts to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires focus on altering fuel characteristics. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels that affect wildfire behavior are moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Moisture content is crucial as it requires heat to evaporate before the biomass can burn. The moisture content of green foliage fluctuates depending on weather conditions. The moisture content of biomass fuels affects wildfire behavior. Green foliage has varying moisture levels, while dead biomass has lower levels. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can ignite easily, but even 100% moisture content biomass can burn in high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized based on how quickly their moisture content decreases. Fine fuels dry out in about an hour, followed by woody twigs and branches in 10 hours, and larger fuels in 100 or 1,000 hours. The size classes of wildfire fuels range from fine flash fuels to 1,000-hour time lag fuels. Fine fuels ignite and burn quickly, while larger fuels burn intensely but contribute little to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution refers to its arrangement horizontally and vertically. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in wildfire behavior. Compactness and continuity of fuels are key factors affecting the spread of fires. Highly compact fuel beds resist burning due to reduced ventilation, while continuous fuels facilitate fire spread. Firelines are used to break the continuity of fuels and control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed influence the width of breaks needed to prevent fire spread. The spread of wildfires is influenced by factors like slope, wind speed, and fuel distribution. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and raising temperatures. \"Fuel ladders\" of continuous fine fuels can spread fires into the canopy, turning surface fires into crown fires. Wind is crucial for sustaining crown fires, which can increase their intensity and spread. Fuel load varies widely and plays a significant role in wildfire behavior. The quantity of biomass fuels, known as fuel loads, varies widely and includes dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre. Live crown biomass density is crucial for sustaining crown fires, where not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire. Wildfires consume different proportions of fuel depending on the size, with large-diameter fuels often remaining after the fire. Ecosystems vary in their adaptation to fire, with some experiencing frequent low-intensity fires and others periodic high-intensity crown fires. Many ecosystems in the US are adapted to relatively frequent wildfires, characterized by large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. Surface-fire ecosystems, which make up about 34% of all U.S. wildlands, historically consisted of grasses, needles, and small shrubs as primary fuels. However, heavy grazing and logging practices in the late 1800s altered these ecosystems by reducing grass cover and promoting the growth of branches and small to mid-sized trees. Effective fire suppression also contributed to the expansion of fuel loads in these ecosystems. In many Western ecosystems, fire suppression and changes in vegetation have led to higher fuel loads and the presence of fuel ladders, increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities to reduce fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. On the other hand, ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires, with plants resprouting after fires, such as chaparral. In crown-fire ecosystems, such as chaparral, fires are infrequent with many plants resprouting from rootstocks. Lodgepole pine is a classic example that regenerates through serotinous cones. Human activities have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. There is no evidence that reducing fuel loads and removing fuel ladders would prevent catastrophic crown fires in ecosystems like southern California chaparral. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires are patchy and leave some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, during the Yellowstone fires in 1988, only about half of the reported burned acres were severely burned. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires of limited scale, mixed with low-intensity surface fires. Whitebark pine is a classic example of a mixed-fire-regime ecosystem, where sporadic fires kill competing species but allow for regeneration through seed production and seed dispersal by Clark's nutcrackers. Other species can also exhibit mixed-fire-regime characteristics under certain circumstances. Crown-fire ecosystems, like ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine, can be mixed-fire types in certain conditions. These ecosystems account for about 24% of U.S. wildlands, but the consequences of fuel reduction activities in these areas are not well understood. It is unclear if fuel levels, sizes, and distributions are unnatural, leading to abnormal crown fire levels. The impact of fuel reduction on wildfire extent and severity in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems is also uncertain. Many suggest reducing fuel loads to suppress wildfires and decrease crown fire risk, but the effectiveness of this approach varies across ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads to decrease crown fire risk and wildfire extent has shown mixed effectiveness in different ecosystems. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 suggests that reducing fuel loads may not always protect structures and communities from wildfires. In some cases, homes survived despite crown fires in the vicinity, indicating the limitations of fuel reduction strategies. Reducing fuel loads in surface-fire ecosystems through prescribed burning and thinning may help decrease wildfire extent. However, caution is advised as these activities may not always prevent crown fires due to changes in microclimate caused by thinning. Thinning can increase surface temperatures by allowing more solar radiation to reach the forest floor. Thinning stands allows solar radiation to reach forest floor, increasing fire intensity. Prescribed burning is controlled fire used in specific conditions, but can escape control and cause damage. Wildland fire use includes naturally occurring fires within acceptable areas and conditions. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels but has limitations on large diameter fuels. It is not effective for reducing tree density and can be risky, with escaped fires becoming notable wildfires. Fire managers tend to err on the side of caution due to the potential for damage and loss of life. Prescribed burning is risky, with escaped fires becoming wildfires. Fire managers err on the side of caution, leading to high costs. Federal land management agencies allow wildfires to burn with monitoring for fire management objectives. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removing of trees in a stand, either for commercial use or to improve stand quality. Different approaches include low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning. Thinning alters biomass fuels and is counted as a fuel reduction treatment. Thinning is a method of removing trees from a stand to improve stand quality and reduce fuel. It can be done in different ways such as low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it allows for controlled removal of trees, reduces crown density, and targets specific fuel components like ladder fuels. However, it also leaves slash on the ground as a disadvantage. Thinning has disadvantages compared to prescribed burning, as it leaves slash on the ground, increasing fuel load. Slash treatment is labor-intensive and costly. Thinning can increase biomass growth but also poses fire hazards, especially in crown-fire ecosystems. However, in surface-fire ecosystems with proper slash treatment, thinning can reduce the risk of catastrophic fires. Thinning combined with prescribed burning is proposed to reduce crown fires by eliminating ladder fuels and fine fuels. However, the effectiveness of this approach is limited and costly compared to alternatives like logging, which reduces crown density but leaves substantial slash. Commercial logging focuses on removing large standing trees, but does little for fuel ladders. Commercial logging can reduce crown density but does little for fuel ladders and leaves substantial slash. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires. Pruning trees can alter fuels for wildfire protection by removing lower branches, reducing fuel ladders and crown density. However, pruning leaves slash on the ground, which can increase fire intensity and spread unless treated. Five federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands. Each agency is implicitly authorized to reduce fuels for wildfire protection within its mandate to preserve and protect the lands and resources under its jurisdiction. Since 1897, the Forest Service has been directed to protect against destruction by fire, while the National Park Service is directed to conserve scenery and natural resources. The Bureau of Land Management was provided authority in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides broad authority for managing public lands to protect various values and provide for wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and human use. The Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have similar directives for conservation and management of resources and habitats. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 grants authority for managing public lands to protect values and provide for wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and human use. The Forest Service has funding programs for biomass fuel reduction activities like prescribed burning and thinning, with Hazardous Fuels funding being the primary source. Funding for these activities increased substantially in FY2001. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly in FY2001 and continued to rise through FY2008, with a spike in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. Funding for thinning and related activities, including fuel reduction and timber production, is allocated within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item. This account also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management efforts. The portion of funding used for thinning varies annually, and the specific amount allocated for wildfire protection is unknown. The FS has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal (BD) and Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, funded by timber purchasers for activities like slash treatments and reforestation after logging operations. These funds can also be used for thinning and reducing fire hazards. The FS has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal (BD) and Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, funded by timber purchasers for activities like slash treatments and reforestation after logging operations. K-V funds can be used for reforesting and improving the forest, similar to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. Stewardship contracting allows for forest stewardship activities like thinning for fuel reduction in timber sale contracts. Funding for thinning and wildfire protection improvements is not specified. DOI agencies receive appropriations similar to FS accounts, with Hazardous Fuels sub-account providing funding for prescribed burning and other fuel-related activities. The majority of funding for prescribed burning in the Wildland Fire Management line item comes from the sub-account within Other Operations. Funding for other fuel reduction activities is also available from this account. Prior to FY2008, Wildland Fire Management was funded through the BLM, with funds allocated to other agencies. DOI fuel reduction funding in the Hazardous Fuels sub-account increased in FY2001 and has remained stable. Thinning and other fuel reduction activities are funded through general land and resource management accounts for each DOI agency. The BLM receives funds for fuel reduction activities from the Land Resources and Western Oregon Resources Management accounts. Funds from various accounts within different agencies can be used for activities that reduce wildfire threats, including reducing biomass fuels. The BLM has a mandatory spending account, the Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund, specifically for activities that improve wildfire protection by reducing biomass fuels. The specific portion of funds allocated for fuel reduction activities from each account is unknown. The Forest Service has two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction, but other agencies lack financial and technical assistance programs for biomass fuel reduction activities. One program, State Fire Assistance, provides funding for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning for fire protection, with allocation based on a non-statutory formula. The specific portion used for fuel reduction varies by state. The Forest Service has two wildfire protection assistance programs: State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance. State Fire Assistance provides funding for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning, with allocation based on a non-statutory formula. Volunteer Fire Assistance offers technical and financial support to rural volunteer fire departments for fire protection. The Community Wildfire Protection program focuses on expanding outreach, education, and establishing defensible space around private homes. The Forest Service aims to expand outreach and education for wildfire protection, including establishing defensible space around homes. They have programs for reducing biomass fuels on private lands with landowner consent, but no funds have been allocated yet. Other assistance programs offer support for forest stewardship, health protection, and emergency restoration. Funding allocation for these programs contributing to wildfire protection is currently unknown."
