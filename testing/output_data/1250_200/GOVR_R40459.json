    "content": "The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) manages fuel procurement for the Department of Defense (DOD), consuming a significant portion of US petroleum products annually. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, evolving into a key entity within the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to purchase and manage DOD's energy supplies. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) manages fuel procurement for the Department of Defense (DOD), primarily focusing on bulk petroleum products like JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. DESC awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery, typically for one-year lengths. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing fuel spending to overall DOD spending and commercially equivalent fuel prices. It also discusses refining and refineries supplying DOD's jet fuel, as well as DESC's fuel procurement practices. The report discusses refining and refineries supplying DOD's jet fuel, DESC's fuel procurement practices, recent legislation affecting fuel procurement, and the use of alternative fuels to meet DOD's needs. High fuel prices have stimulated interest in producing alternative fuels, but legislation now aims to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas emissions may minimally impact refineries, while legislation to cap emissions could affect refinery operations and responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. The majority of DESC's bulk fuel purchases are for JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army being the primary consumers. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 at 145.1 million barrels during the Iraq invasion. JP-8 purchases peaked in FY2004 and have been declining since. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase. DESC's petroleum product purchases, summarized by volume and total cost, do not necessarily correspond with DOD's actual consumption. Fuel costs and average prices continued to increase, driven by rising crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of all petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. Jet fuel prices reversed their price advantage over commercial equivalents after events like September 11, 2001, and the Iraq invasion. The military jet fuel price advantages reversed after events like September 11, 2001, and the Iraq invasion in 2003. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices increased significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. DOD responded by purchasing alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel when offered at lower prices than military specification fuel. Outlays represent DOD's actual spending on petroleum products. Total defense outlays increased significantly from FY2000 to FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs also surged by 497% during this period, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. relies on imports for two-thirds of its crude oil consumption, with a shift towards heavier sour crudes due to diminishing sweet crude supplies. The refining process of crude oil involves separating natural components into different products like gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Refineries may use heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts to process the residuum after atmospheric distillation. Specifications for jet fuel are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries are typically set up to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour, with light sweet crude being preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Refineries are set up based on the type of crude oil they process, such as topping refineries, hydroskimming refineries, cracking refineries, and coking refineries. The atmospheric distillation capacity of a refinery determines its crude oil processing limit. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries. Refineries may upgrade processes to handle heavier crude oils, while EPA regulations also impact refinery operations. Gulf Coast refineries with higher complexity can yield significant amounts of jet fuel and diesel. The EPA regulations require refineries to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel with limited sulfur content. Refiners must handle contaminated \"transmix\" to prevent additional sulfur pickup during pipeline transit. DOD has adopted the concept of using JP-8 for both aircraft and ground equipment in theaters of operation. The U.S. Army has adopted ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 for readiness. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act. They have proposed a finding that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health. A Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule has been proposed, requiring petroleum refineries to report emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future legislation and regulations. The EPA has proposed a rule that would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, which could lead to future legislation capping greenhouse gas emissions. Bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the United States with nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude capacity. The number of refineries in the US declined from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but the atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The median capacity of currently operating refineries is roughly 80,000 bpd. The charge capacity for kerosene/jet fuel in US refineries averages slightly over 1 million barrels per stream day. The 70 refineries above the median capacity make up 85% of overall US refining capacity. Gulf Coast refineries yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. US refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of US net production of jet fuel. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded US refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years. U.S. refineries do not meet all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. DESC has increased its purchase of commercial jet fuels due to the current capacity of U.S. refineries not meeting all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel as commercial jet fuel is priced lower. To ensure closer refineries supply the fuel, DESC also makes purchases through contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces and installations outside the continental United States. The Navy can purchase fuel in any manner deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Navy under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. This section supersedes 34 U.S.C. 580 and allows for the procurement of fuel under the general procurement authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304. DESC awards contracts and purchases fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund, transferring the fuel internally to DOD customers. This process allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for DOD customers throughout the fiscal year. The acquisition process for DOD involves purchasing property or services to support agency missions. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs military procurement laws, while the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) outlines federal agency acquisition regulations. The Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) is used by DOD for procurement. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment provisions. These contracts are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions under FAR and DFARS. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas. \"Departments can enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922, with options for up to three five-year renewals. Multiyear contracts buy more than one year's requirement without needing to exercise an option for each program year after the first, while multiple year contracts have a term of more than one year regardless of fiscal year funding.\" Multiyear contract authority for supplies allows DOD agencies to enter into contracts for supplies promoting national security and resulting in cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged for lower costs and national security objectives. The contract cannot exceed $500 million. The Secretary of Defense can authorize multiyear contracts for procurement of alternative fuels, including fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands. The contracts may be for one or more years, and the Secretary has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels based on market conditions. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum and natural gas. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) determines contract delivery prices based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, redistributing fuel to bases and installations. DESC levels fuel prices for all DOD customers, including a surcharge for operating costs. While DESC's contracts specify final destinations, additional costs may be incurred by operational commands for tactical fuel delivery. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider hidden costs in fuel logistics. DOD saw a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices. The act also appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military operations. Fuel costs have been a significant concern for the Department of Defense (DOD), representing up to 3% of its spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Unlike the airline industry, DOD has limited options to address high fuel costs, relying on supplemental appropriations to cover the increased expenses. DOD has explored strategies such as fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and alternative fuels to mitigate its vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations and supply shortages. The Department of Defense (DOD) has explored options such as fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and alternative fuels to reduce vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel costs based on crude oil prices. This strategy limits risk but does not control costs during rapid price increases. The airline industry uses hedging strategies to minimize fuel price risk. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel at $51/barrel when oil prices peaked at $147/barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board explored fuel hedging to reduce DOD's exposure to price volatility. They suggested engaging in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service to offset increasing fuel costs during oil price spikes. The Department of Defense (DOD) could request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to seek legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on unanticipated price changes. Interior's main revenue comes from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, with royalties-in-kind paid by OCS lessees in the form of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR was created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions, holding roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. Drawdowns from the SPR under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can be in the form of a sale or exchange. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid decline in crude oil prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of U.S. refined crude oil was heavier than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refineries processing heavy oil cannot operate at full capacity with lighter oils. The types of oil in the SPR are not fully compatible with 36 vulnerable refineries, potentially reducing U.S. refining throughput by 735,000 barrels per day. The SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil, could be compromised. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) faces operational limitations in producing jet fuel due to the yield of other petroleum products. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless they meet specific emissions criteria. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements. Private investment in a CTL fuel plant for Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana is being considered, while DESC is looking into a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel needs in Alaska. Despite recent declines in crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains. Policy and economic factors currently hinder the use of fossil-based alternatives. The DOD is focusing on efficiency in response to energy challenges, and may provide Congress with information on the full cost of fuel for military operations. Concerns for Congress include the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD procurement announcements during periods of high petroleum prices, as well as the potential impact of greenhouse gas emission caps on refinery operations. There is also a concern about the possibility of refinery shutdowns affecting defense fuel supply in the long term. In the long term, Congress may be concerned about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel supply. Background information on alternative fuel sources, greenhouse gas legislation, and various fuel classifications is available in CRS reports. Icing Inhibitor FOB is a trade term where the seller delivers goods on board a vessel designated by the buyer. It involves international transportation contracts with abbreviated trade terms. Jet A-1 is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel with ASTM specification D16555, also known as F-35 by NATO. Jet A is a similar jet fuel with a higher freeze point, supplied under ASTM D1655 specification. Jet B is a distillate fuel used as an alternative to Jet A-1, with higher flammability and better cold weather performance. JP-4 and JP-5 are military equivalents with additional additives for corrosion inhibition and fire safety. JP-5 is specifically designed for aircraft carriers due to its higher flash-point. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point suitable for aircraft carriers. It is also used as ship turbine fuel. JP-8, a military equivalent of Jet A-1, is less flammable and hazardous, with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 for safety and combat survivability. JP-8 contains less benzene and n-hexane than JP-4, with an ASTM specification of MIL-DTL-83133. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Middle Distillate range fuels like kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel are used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements over up to five years. Naphtha, a petroleum distillate, is used as a feedstock. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production for catalytic reformation into a higher octane product called reformate."
