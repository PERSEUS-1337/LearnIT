    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with teenage drivers having significantly higher fatality rates compared to older age groups. Teenage drivers also account for over a third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in. Teenage drivers account for over a third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly two-thirds of those fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The chance of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers aged 15-20. Nighttime driving by teenagers results in over 50% of motor vehicle crash fatalities involving teenage drivers. In 1997, Florida's graduated driver licensing system led to a 9% decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers aged 15-18. Michigan and North Carolina saw a 25-27% decrease in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers after implementing comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems in 1997. California's program from 1998-2000 resulted in a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries and a 24% decrease in at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board also reports on the effectiveness of these programs. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that many states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but some have not yet implemented other basic safety features. A 2001 Harris Poll shows that a majority of Americans support requirements such as 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult, a 6-month learner's permit period, and limiting the number of teenage passengers in a car with a teenage driver. State graduated driver licensing laws are addressed in Section 3. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process, starting with a learner's permit stage at 16 years old. This stage lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cellphone use while driving, night driving, and continues until the intermediate stage begins. The intermediate stage of state graduated driver licensing laws starts immediately after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cellphone use, night driving, limits non-familial passengers under 21, and continues until the driver turns 18. The learner's permit stage requires at least 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver at all times while operating a motor vehicle. The Secretary of Transportation shall promulgate rules for delaying the grant of an unrestricted driver's license for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses during the learner's permit or intermediate stage, such as driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, speeding, or other offenses as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations to implement rules for delaying unrestricted driver's licenses for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses, as determined by the Secretary, in accordance with notice and comment provisions under section 553 of title 5, United States. Incentive grants will be provided as per Section 4. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application with certification from the Governor. Grant amounts are determined based on the appropriation for each fiscal year. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States based on a formula using appropriated funds and state apportionment ratios. States can use the grant for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials, and other administrative activities related to the licensing process. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorization of $25,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for the State's 2-stage licensing process. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth year, the withholding increases to 5 percent, and from the sixth year onwards, it will be 10 percent. After the fifth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not compliant with section 3(a) of the Act. Withheld funds are available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation year. After the sixth fiscal year, funds withheld under subsection (a)(2) from non-compliant states will not be distributed. If a state complies with section 3(a) before the funds expire, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the withheld amounts to the state. The distributed funds must be spent by the state within three fiscal years, or they will revert back to the Treasury. If a state is not compliant with section 3(a) by the end of the period, any withheld funds will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
