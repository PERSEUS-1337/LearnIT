    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Illegal Worker Prevention Act\" and includes provisions for the debarment of federal contractors who do not comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act employment provisions. The \"Illegal Worker Prevention Act\" prohibits federal agencies from contracting with employers who violate immigration employment laws. The Attorney General is authorized to investigate non-compliance with these provisions. The Attorney General investigates complaints of noncompliance with immigration employment laws by contractors or their units. If noncompliance is found, the determination is transmitted to contracting executive agencies. The Attorney General investigates complaints of noncompliance with immigration employment laws by contractors or their units. The determination is then transmitted to contracting executive agencies for consideration of debarment. The head of an executive agency has the authority to debar a contractor based on the Attorney General's determination, which is not reviewable in debarment proceedings. The Attorney General investigates noncompliance with immigration employment laws by contractors or their units. Debarment may be imposed on organizational units found to violate the INA employment provisions for a period of one year, extendable if noncompliance persists. Debarred contractors and units are listed by the Administrator of General Services. Debarred contractors and organizational units are listed on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs. They are ineligible to participate in any federal government procurement or nonprocurement activities. The Attorney General has the authority to prescribe regulations and issue orders to enforce compliance with immigration employment laws. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation for implementation of debarment responsibilities. Executive agencies must cooperate with the Attorney General as necessary. Delegation of duties can be made by the Attorney General, Secretary of Defense, and other agency heads. The Administrator of General Services, NASA Administrator, and other agency heads can delegate their duties to agency officers or employees. Implementation of this section should not overly burden the federal procurement process. Employers must still comply with antidiscrimination laws related to immigration practices. This section clarifies that it does not add any new certification requirements to contracts, does not create new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States, and does not prevent judicial review of agency decisions. Definitions for \"executive agency\" and \"contractor\" are provided. The Federal Procurement Policy Act defines a contractor as any individual or legal entity that submits offers for or is awarded a Federal Government contract, including subcontracts, or conducts business with the Federal Government on behalf of another contractor."
