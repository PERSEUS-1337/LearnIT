    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with other energy technologies over different time periods. The final funding amounts for FY2017 and FY2018 were established by specific acts signed by the President. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. The President signed the DOE funding bill on May 23, 2018. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. Charts and tables show funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978, with a focus on different time periods. Energy availability and R&D played crucial roles in World War II. During World War II, energy availability and research and development (R&D) were crucial. After the war, R&D focused on energy sources like fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for nuclear development. The AEC also promoted civilian use of nuclear energy. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration and Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) were established. The Department of Energy (DOE) was created in 1975 to oversee these efforts. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. It brought together all energy R&D programs including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency technologies. The federal government expanded its R&D programs in response to the energy crises of the 1970s to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The federal government expanded R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in response to the energy crises of the 1970s. DOE has been the main funder of energy R&D since FY1978, with funding peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979. Funding dropped to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s but has gradually increased since, reaching nearly $4.5 billion in FY2018, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009."
