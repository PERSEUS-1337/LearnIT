    "content": "Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states that the President's compensation cannot be increased or decreased during their term. The President's salary is currently $400,000, subject to income tax, with an additional $50,000 allowance for official expenses. Upon leaving office, the President receives a pension equal to the salary for Level I of the Executive Schedule. The President's salary, currently $400,000, is $300 short of half the President's current salary. The compensation provision in the Constitution applies to a President's term of office. The President's salary has been adjusted five times since 1789. In 1949, Congress passed legislation to increase the salary to $100,000 per annum. In 1949, Congress passed legislation (S.103) to increase the President's salary to $100,000 per annum, a $25,000 increase from the previous rate of $75,000 in effect since 1909. The salary became effective on January 19, 1949, coinciding with President Harry S. Truman's second term inauguration. Senator Herbert O'Conor provided a brief history of the proposal during Senate consideration of S.103 on January 13, 1949. After months of study, a proposed redraft of a bill was discussed by the subcommittee. S.103, introduced by the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee, recommended salary increases for top government positions. The Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries suggested raising the President's salary from $100,000 to $200,000, which was approved in 1969 through H.R. 10 signed into law by President Johnson. In 1969, the President's salary was increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per annum through H.R. 10 signed into law by President Johnson. The salary adjustment needed to be expedited before Richard M. Nixon's inauguration on January 20, 1969, to ensure it took effect during his term. Speaker of the House John McCormack emphasized the urgency of passing the legislation before the deadline. The deadline to increase the President's salary to $200,000 per annum is January 20. Efforts are being made to pass a bill before this date to ensure the President can benefit from the raise during his term. House Majority Leader Carl Albert is leading the initiative to expedite the process before the deadline. During consideration of H.R. 10 on January 6, 1969, House Majority Leader Carl Albert emphasized that the legislation to increase the President's salary was initiated by Members of Congress, not the President. Senator Hiram Fong expressed a desire for more time to discuss the bill in the Senate, but Majority Leader Mike Mansfield explained that Senate traditions prevented immediate consideration. The President's salary was eventually increased to $400,000 per annum when Congress passed H.R. 2490 and President Clinton signed it into law on September 29, 1999. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum when Congress passed H.R. 2490 and President Clinton signed it into law on September 29, 1999. This action occurred more than 15 months prior to the effective date of the salary change. Witnesses testified in support of the salary increase to reflect the prestige of the office. Witnesses and public interest groups testified in favor of increasing the President's salary to at least $400,000, citing the prestige of the office. The Congressional Accountability Project opposed the increase, arguing that it would raise the salaries of other top officials. No legislation was introduced in the 110th, 111th, or 112th Congress to raise the salary of the President."
