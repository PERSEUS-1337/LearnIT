    "title": "SB 1095",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: The Health and Safety Code is amended to ensure that the genetic disease testing program is funded by fees collected for services provided. The department will charge fees for tests and activities, with the amount established by regulation. Fees for prenatal screening and follow-up services will be deposited in specific funds. The department will expedite the fee collection process to initiate it promptly. Effective July 1, 2002, the department will charge fees for newborn screening and follow-up services to hospitals or families of newborns. Prenatal screening fees to support the Birth Defects Monitoring Program will be ten dollars. Guidelines will be set for invoicing approved researchers for research expenses. The Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund is established to support pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities. Fee revenues collected will be deposited into the fund for appropriation by the Legislature. Interest earned on funds in the fund will also support the program. The Legislature recognizes the need for efficient implementation of genetic screening program changes and maintenance of quality services. Expenditure from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund for these purposes is exempt from certain public contract regulations. The Department of Finance must ensure equipment and services are obtained at the lowest cost while meeting technical requirements. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can be used for implementing Tandem Mass Spectrometry screening for various disorders without being subject to certain public contract regulations. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can be used to expand the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include additional diseases detectable in blood samples, without being subject to certain public contract regulations. The department may adopt emergency regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act without Office of Administrative Law approval for immediate public safety. Regulations must be filed with the Secretary of State and subject to public hearing within 120 days. The Office of Administrative Law will print and publish regulations in the California Code of Regulations. These regulations will not be repealed by the Office of Administrative Law and will remain in effect until revised or repealed by the department. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of a well-funded genetic disease program for the health and safety of California newborns. Section 125001 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. The department will establish a genetic disease testing program, providing screening and follow-up services for individuals who undergo the screening. Qualified laboratories or metabolic specialty clinics may be contracted for testing and treatment. The department will expand newborn screening statewide to include various disorders through tandem mass spectrometry. Information on these disorders and testing resources will be provided to pregnant women and those admitted for delivery. If unable to provide screening by August 1, 2005, testing services will be obtained through a competitive bid process from qualified laboratories. If contracting for services is more cost-effective, the department will do so. The department will expand statewide newborn screening to include severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other T-cell lymphopenias without additional costs. Screening for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and other detectable diseases in blood samples will be implemented within two years of adoption by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP)."
