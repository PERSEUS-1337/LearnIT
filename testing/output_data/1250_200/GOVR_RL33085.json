    "content": "The service sector encompasses a wide range of economic activities that provide human value-added in various forms. These activities are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Rapid technological changes are expanding the possibilities for service delivery. Examples of services include retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, healthcare, and more. Services are a significant sector of the U.S. economy. The service sector in the U.S. economy is crucial, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. Financial services play a vital role in capital flow, while delivery and distribution services ensure goods are available when needed. Inefficiencies in these industries could have adverse consequences for the economy. U.S. trade in services, although smaller than trade in goods, is important, accounting for 30% of total exports in 2010. In 2010, services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports of goods and services and 17% of total U.S. imports. Many service providers establish a presence in the country of the consumer for direct contact. Cross-border services trade data do not capture all trade in services, and data on sales by foreign affiliates provide a more accurate measurement. In the latest year, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services. Data on services trade via temporary movement of consumers or providers is not readily available. Multilateral negotiations in services trade were initiated in the Trade Act of 1974, but no agreement was reached during the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979. During the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979, there was no agreement on services trade. However, services were later included in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, leading to the establishment of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Geza Feketekuty highlights three challenges in creating rules for international trade in services. The challenges in creating rules for international trade in services include distinguishing legitimate regulations for health and safety from those protecting domestic service providers, recognizing that most services transactions occur behind customs borders, and adapting to technology advances like the internet. The GATS structure acknowledges that barriers to trade in services often exist within borders, requiring flexible yet disciplined rules to address them effectively. The GATS divides modes of delivery of services into four categories: cross-border supply (mode 1), consumption abroad (mode 2), and commercial presence (mode 3). These modes determine how services are provided across borders, such as through physical travel or establishing a local branch. The GATS divides modes of delivery of services into four categories: cross-border supply (mode 1), consumption abroad (mode 2), and commercial presence (mode 3). Commercial presence involves the supplier establishing a branch, agency, or subsidiary in another country to provide services locally. The GATS aims to promote trade in services among WTO members and allows for government regulation to meet national policy objectives. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services, government barriers, and modes of delivery. Part II outlines principles and obligations for all service sectors, including MFN treatment, transparency, impartial administration of rules, and requirements for monopoly suppliers. Part II of the GATS establishes rules and regulations for service providers, including impartial administration and obligations for monopoly suppliers. It also includes exceptions for balance of payments difficulties and national security purposes. Part III outlines market access and national treatment obligations for members, prohibiting less favorable treatment and placing limits on foreign service suppliers. Part III of the GATS outlines market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring equal treatment for service providers from other countries and allowing for negotiations to reduce trade barriers. National treatment and market access obligations apply only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments. The GATS includes technical elements such as new negotiation requirements and dispute settlement mechanisms. Annexes cover MFN exemptions, financial services, transportation, telecommunication, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Negotiations on financial services, telecommunication, maritime services continue. The GATS stipulated negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with few results, and maritime services negotiations ended in June 1996 without conclusion. WTO members make commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors under the GATS. Each member submits a schedule of commitments during negotiations, which is a part of the GATS. Each WTO member must submit a Schedule of Commitments (SC) during GATS negotiations. The SC is a detailed document divided into four columns, outlining market access and national treatment restrictions for each service sector. It is split into horizontal commitments applying to all sectors and sector-specific commitments. The SCs are lengthy due to the detailed identification of each service sector. The Schedule of Commitments (SC) in GATS negotiations is a detailed document outlining market access and national treatment restrictions for each service sector. The negotiations aim to reform GATS rules, expand service sectors covered, and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. The evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations, as well as U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners, are discussed. Article XIX of the GATS required WTO members to begin new negotiations to maintain momentum in service negotiations. Article XIX of the GATS mandated WTO members to start new negotiations on services within five years of the GATS entering into force. These negotiations addressed issues such as government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political challenges following the 1999 WTO Ministerial in Seattle. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the negotiations. The WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines in March 2001 for negotiations on services, focusing on progressive liberalization of trade while respecting members' right to regulate. All service sectors and delivery modes are subject to negotiations, with a deadline extended to the end of the DDA. Special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services will be open to all WTO members for negotiations using the \"request-offer\" format. The WTO members adopted modalities in September 2003 for negotiating new commitments, with special attention to the needs of developing countries. Modalities were also agreed upon in March 2003 for giving credit for autonomous liberalization. The DDA was successfully launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle, with services negotiation included in the agenda. The Ministerial Declaration set deadlines for submitting requests and offers by June 30, 2002. The DDA negotiations faced challenges as deadlines were missed, leading to concerns about the collapse of the round. A negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to reinvigorate the process, emphasizing the importance of timely and high-quality offers. Services negotiations were briefly mentioned in the framework. The DDA negotiations emphasized the importance of timely and high-quality offers, with services briefly mentioned in the July framework. Negotiations on services were placed on par with agriculture and market access for non-agricultural goods, conducted through working groups and request-offer format. Members submit wish-lists and offers, with negotiations continuing until consensus is reached on acceptable commitments. Unlike goods negotiations, services negotiations are not conducted multilaterally among all members at the same time. The WTO services negotiations, unlike goods negotiations, consist of simultaneous bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral negotiations among members. The negotiations have been ongoing for over five years, facing delays and challenges. In 2006, the DDA negotiations were suspended due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities, but resumed in 2007. Despite efforts from developed and developing countries, a consensus on basic negotiating objectives has not been reached. The United States and chief trading partners have not reached a consensus on basic negotiating objectives in the WTO services negotiations. The US aims to secure market access commitments and address concerns about market openness levels from previous agreements. The United States has called for WTO members to raise their market openness commitments to actual levels to prevent slippage. Government regulation is a pervasive aspect of services trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. Service providers, whether domestic or foreign, must be aware of regulatory procedures to conduct business effectively. U.S. service providers face obstacles due to lack of transparency in regulations in foreign markets, especially in developing countries. The United States is pushing for WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for licensing, inform the public about regulations before implementation, and allow for public input. Establishing a local presence is crucial for U.S. service providers to conduct business effectively across various sectors. The United States is urging WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including financial services like insurance, banking, and securities. They are also requesting commitments to improve market access, transparency, and fairness in financial services regulations. Additionally, the US is seeking increased market access in telecommunications services and ownership of cable facilities. The United States is requesting market access commitments for telecommunications carriers, road freight transport, order processing services, and express delivery services. They are also addressing issues of cross-subsidization in express delivery services and seeking increased market access in energy services markets. Additionally, the US is prioritizing services that protect the environment from degradation in the services negotiations. The United States is prioritizing services that protect the environment from degradation in the services negotiations. They have requested increased market access for services related to wastewater treatment, solid/hazardous waste management, soil and water cleanup, noise and vibration abatement, and protection of biodiversity and landscape. Additionally, the US has asked for full market access to retail, wholesale, and franchising services, including services delivered directly to customers or remotely through various means. The US also seeks increased market access for foreign lawyers, accountants, and other professionals. The United States has requested increased market access for various professional services and computer-related services. They presented their initial and revised offers in 2003 and 2005 respectively, aiming to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The U.S. initial and revised offers aim to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers, including improvements since the Uruguay Round agreements. The U.S. defends its offers by stating its services markets are already open and seeks WTO members to meet its standards. The offers include horizontal commitments applying to all sectors listed in the U.S. schedule of commitments, such as temporary entry of personnel. The U.S. offers include horizontal commitments for all sectors listed in the schedule of commitments, such as temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S. This includes services sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. The U.S. also permits temporary entry of personnel engaged in land acquisition in scheduled services sectors and subsectors. The U.S. proposal includes restrictions on land acquisition for federally owned land to U.S. citizens. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents. The U.S. has offered commitments in various sectors and subsectors, including business services, market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, and services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing. Exceptions mainly involve state restrictions on foreign service providers. The United States has offered commitments in various sectors such as computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, and more. Developing countries criticize the U.S. for not offering broader commitments, especially in sectors like maritime services and postal services. India criticizes U.S. commitments in mode-4 delivery, arguing for access for software specialists and IT engineers not affiliated with Indian-owned firms. Negotiations in the DDA have been delayed, with challenges including the negotiating format. Some negotiators and observers suggest that the negotiating format is stalling the DDA process. The US and EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" for targeted sectors, with the US advocating for commitments in six core sectors and the EU for a smaller list. Developing countries oppose the \"benchmark\" proposals, arguing it deviates from the established mandate for the DDA negotiations. Some developing countries are concerned that benchmarks may favor sectors favored by developed countries. The US services business community worries that benchmarks could cause delays. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, proposed changes to jumpstart negotiations on services. The US wants countries to identify concessions before agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations are completed. Developing countries reject this proposal and want to maintain the current sequencing. The positive list approach to market access commitments has been criticized for potentially hindering market access liberalization. The United States prefers the \"negative list\" approach in free trade agreements. Mode-4 delivery in services has become a controversial issue, dividing developed and developing countries. Developing countries have criticized the United States regarding mode-4, creating tension between them. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery in services has led to differing positions among developed and developing countries. Developing countries, including India, have criticized the United States for its stance on mode-4 commitments despite it accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services. The issue is closely related to immigration policy and has caused tension between the U.S. business community and government. Several developing countries, including India, have criticized the United States for visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the country. The mode-4 issue has also become a matter of congressional authority, with objections raised during the consideration of implementing bills for free trade agreements. Compromises were made to separate changes in visa policy from trade legislation. The U.S. business community pushes for more flexibility in mode-4 offers in trade agreements, proposing alternative options. Little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures for services. Negotiations on government procurement and services have been slow, with unresolved questions on countervailable subsidies and safeguard measures. Developing countries prioritize these issues, but after over 10 years, services negotiations have not advanced much. Negotiations on government procurement and services have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. Many WTO members, especially developing countries, have offers that do not reflect the actual openness of their services market. The best offers made so far are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies. WTO members have been hesitant to lock in trade in services and prefer the option to apply more restrictions without violating commitments. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including services negotiations, in 2006 after disagreements among G-6 members. Negotiations resumed in 2007. Negotiations on government procurement and services have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. The lack of agreement on basic conditions for agriculture and NAMA negotiations has hindered progress. Developed countries with advanced services sectors clash with developing countries over market access. Developing countries link their offers to reductions in agriculture subsidies by the US and EU. The negotiations on reducing agriculture subsidies and market liberalization in services sectors are facing challenges due to the complexity of the agenda and the number of participants involved. The prospects for the services negotiations are uncertain, with factors like participants waiting to reveal their best negotiating positions closer to deadlines impacting the progress and completion of the negotiations. The WTO services negotiations face challenges as participants wait to reveal their best negotiating positions closer to deadlines. Factors like political will, willingness to compromise, and resolving issues in agriculture and market access impact the completion of negotiations. The sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by the end of 2006, reaffirming commitment to complete services negotiations with special consideration for developing countries. Annex C to the Declaration provides modalities for completing the negotiations. The WTO services negotiations faced challenges as countries were divided on key objectives. Developed countries wanted binding commitments on trade in services, while developing countries resisted without greater reductions in agriculture subsidies. In July 2008, a ministerial meeting was called to address modalities for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. The WTO services negotiations in 2009 and 2010 faced challenges with limited progress. Participants were hesitant to go beyond current levels of liberalization, hindering momentum. Senator Charles Grassley expressed concerns about the stalled Doha services negotiations, emphasizing the need for a strong services package for his support."
