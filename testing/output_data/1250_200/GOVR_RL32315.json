The conflict between environmental protection and the need for increased domestic energy production is a major policy issue. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices on public lands have been a topic of debate in Congress for years. The debate in Congress over oil and gas resources on public lands dates back to the early years of the industry. Originally, these resources could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872, but concerns about abuse led to the Pickett Act of 1910, which gave the executive branch authority to withdraw lands. Eventually, the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process and established a leasing system that has generated significant revenues for the federal government. The federal government has raised billions of dollars in revenues from royalties, rents, and bonus bids through a leasing system for minerals on public lands. Split-estate situations exist where the federal government owns minerals under privately held lands, with specific policies and procedures for mineral development. In Wyoming, 50% of lands are split-estate, and in Montana, about 57%. Environmentalists support these measures. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Ranchers and other groups also express concerns about the impact of development on water and land. Development supporters argue that there are numerous environmental laws in place to regulate oil and gas development on public lands, including compliance with NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and state and federal reclamation standards. The industry complains about delays in drilling due to environmental reviews. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill (H.R. 6) and S. 2095 aims to address industry and Bush Administration concerns over increasing domestic oil and natural gas supplies. Title III of the bill would establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands. Environmentalists and public land users argue that these provisions could harm the environment. The Senate's scaled-back substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action. The report discusses onshore oil and gas development in the U.S., including permitting, production, and reserves. It also covers the leasing process for federal public lands and the lengthy drilling permit requirements. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued by the federal government. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must consider environmental impacts during land-use planning when Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are developed and implemented. RMPs cover diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy, aiming to serve present and future generations while being consistent with environmental regulations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) develops Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to determine which public lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 requires that public lands be offered for lease through competitive bidding to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the federal government. If no bids are received or the highest bid is below the minimum acceptable bid, leases are offered noncompetitively. Noncompetitive leasing requires a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM for activities excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well. Drilling on an oil and gas lease can be granted without prior approval of a plan of operations by the Secretary concerned. The application process includes submitting a drilling plan, surface use plan, and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) reviews the application within 35 days and may approve, approve with stipulations, reject, or delay it. Despite a 35-day review requirement, a study found that it took an average of 137 days to approve an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) in 2002. In 2002, the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States found that it took an average of 137 days to approve an APD, up from 84 days in 2001. Delays in drilling permits are often due to the need to update outdated RMPs to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development. The BLM is currently revising several plans to align with FLPMA regulations. The process of revising RMPs under the National Environmental Policy Act has become more time-consuming, with some taking up to three years to complete. This delay is attributed to the need to address new land use concerns, particularly related to coalbed methane development. Environmentalists argue that relying on outdated 20-year-old plans for land management decisions is inadequate. The BLM often waits for the completion of a new RMP and EIS before conducting site-specific analysis for drilling permits. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process for drilling, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing area development planning, and revising relevant manuals. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard terms, open with restrictions, or closed for leasing due to land withdrawals or other mechanisms, often including wilderness areas and environmentally sensitive regions. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, with some areas closed for various reasons such as land use planning, NEPA compliance, endangered species habitat, or historical sites. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those statutorily withdrawn. Another 182 million acres are subject to surface management agency approval for mineral development, ensuring no conflict with land designations and plans. 182 million acres are subject to approval by the surfacemanagement agency, with restrictions such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations, and controlled surface use. Industry argues that these stipulations hinder exploration and limit reserve base, despite favorable production conditions. The industry argues that federal withdrawals inhibit exploration and limit the reserve base, despite favorable production conditions. Environmental groups argue that withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil reserves on public lands. The region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in natural gas access and Bush Administration policies. Three recent reports analyzed restrictions on natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region: National Petroleum Council(NPC) report, Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments (EPCA) study, and U.S. Natural Gas Markets report by the EIA. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands available for development was similar. NPC study estimated 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, EIA estimated 293.6 tcf, and EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in five major geologic basins within the region. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in the five major geologic basins in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the amount of natural gas open to leasing, with 60% and 51.5% respectively. The EPCA study also found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open under standard lease terms. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open under standard lease terms. Including the Rocky Mountain reserves in the EIA report would likely increase the percentage of natural gas open for leasing and decrease the amount under restrictions. The study also identified about 600 million barrels of oil resources falling under \"no access\" category, with 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third of which have restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The NPC and EIA studies show that development of natural gas in restricted land categories could face costly delays. The EIA suggests that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of gas could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would pose risks to the environment. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are closed or restricted. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 137 tcf. This region represents 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the US. If the 108 tcf of restricted natural gas were produced, it could last 20-30 years, meeting 15% of projected annual US demand. Currently, US natural gas demand is met by various sources including the Rocky Mountain region. The Wilderness Society (TWS) testified that the US has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with 1,351 tcf potentially available for development. The NPC report suggests that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas could be brought into production in the near term, despite restrictions. The NPC proposes relaxing land-use constraints to access gas in the intermountain west, including \"no surface occupancy\" designations and restrictive environmental stipulations. RAND Corporation suggests focusing on viable reserve categories to reduce access restrictions. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decline to 5.3 mbd by 2025 with imports making up 65% of supply. Federal onshore oil production accounted for 5.4% in 2002, mainly in Wyoming, New Mexico, and California. Natural gas production was 19.4 tcf in 2002, with fluctuations between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002. Projections show production reaching 20 tcf - 24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports projected to rise from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico and Wyoming as top producers. In 2002, Texas leads the United States in oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels, with a decline of 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years. Natural gas reserves were 187 tcf, with Wyoming and Texas as top producers. Oil discoveries in 2001 were three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. The United States has substantial oil reserves, with technically recoverable resources estimated at 92 billion barrels. However, the rate of production is expected to decline over the long term. In contrast, natural gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have also increased to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual gas discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. The EIA estimates that technically recoverable gas resources in the United States are about 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment shows 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. Most of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Public lands in the Rocky Mountain region hold a significant portion of proven reserves, with federal onshore oil at 12.5% and natural gas at 22.3% of all technically recoverable resources. The EIA estimates that federal onshore oil accounts for 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands makes up 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet, and unconventional natural gas at 358.7 tcf. Coalbed methane gas is dissolved in water and trapped in coalbeds, with extraction methods raising concerns about groundwater contamination. The USGS reports that water pumped out of coal beds can vary in quality and can be discharged for reuse if fresh or disposed of by injection or surface discharge. CBM production has increased significantly since 1987, with 10,000 wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day in 2002. Leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, with DOE estimating 39,000 new wells by 2010, mostly on federal lands. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the US are classified as economically viable reserves. The estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the United States has only about 100 tcf classified as economically recoverable. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Colorado and New Mexico holding over half of U.S. reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, while the Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf, with the federal government owning over half of the mineral rights in the area. The federal government owns over half the mineral rights in the Powder River Basin (PRB), with most CBM production on private lands. Concerns arise over surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees, leading to the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002. Environmental worries focus on land and water issues from CBM production. The production of Coalbed Methane (CBM) raises concerns about land disturbance, water issues, and hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has expressed concerns over the use of diesel fuel in the process, leading to an agreement to end its use. Proposed energy legislation includes provisions to prohibit EPA regulation. The production of Coalbed Methane (CBM) raises concerns about water pollution from sodium-tainted water seeping into underground aquifers. CBM production results in significant water discharges annually, with environmentalists raising concerns about the impact on groundwater and wildlife water sources. Holding ponds used in the process are seen as potential sources of groundwater contamination. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. raises concerns about the impact of CBM production on groundwater quality and wildlife habitats. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells to monitor water quality and levels. IBLA invalidated three leases in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental environmental assessments were conducted for CBM production in the Powder River Basin, leading to increased drilling but also new conditions for producers. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM over leases in 2002, prompting a review of the resource management plan. After legal proceedings, BLM finalized a new EA and RMP, with plans to approve 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. DOI approved the issuance of permits in July 2003. Demand for oil and natural gas in the United States is expected to rise annually, with imports projected to reach nearly 65%. The outlook for increased production from public lands is mixed, with uncertainties surrounding the amount of domestic supply that will come from restricted areas. The Bush Administration has taken steps to ease restrictions, but opposition and challenges based on alleged violations of BLM's mandate have been reported. Congressional action would be required to change the status of statutorily removed areas. The forecast for natural gas production in the United States shows an increase in unconventional gas production, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental groups and surface owners are concerned about potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. Meeting U.S. energy demand will likely involve a mix of increased domestic output and higher imports, with the Rocky Mountain region expected to contribute significantly to natural gas production by 2025. The U.S. may also rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries and increased production from the deepwater OCS. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, primarily LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms worldwide continue exploration and development, considering factors like resource base, political stability, and financing. The terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases include acreage limits, bonus bids, rental fees, royalties, and bond requirements. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties. Revenues are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and other programs. States receive a percentage of revenues from public land oil and gas leases, with Alaska receiving the highest share. Revenues from federal leases fluctuate due to price changes, with a significant increase in 2000. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural objects, and wildlife for future generations. Early tensions arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The focus of the public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s was on the Commander-in-Chief's authority. During the early 1900s, the debate over public lands withdrawal focused on the President's authority to make the order based on national security. Withdrawals changed the designation of specific land parcels from available to unavailable for various activities. Presidents have historically exercised the power to withdraw or reserve lands, such as establishing military reservations. This was done through acts like the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The President can create national monuments through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act, reserving the smallest area necessary for protection. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated recreation and primitive areas. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Wilderness Act also withdrew large areas from resource use. Congressional wilderness designations were seen as essential to prevent administrative revocation. The Forest Service was required to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. The Wilderness Act mandated the Forest Service to study 5.4 million acres for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development. Federal lands can only be designated as wilderness by Congress or as provided by the Wilderness Act. There are four types of withdrawal: congressional authority, executive branch power delegated by Congress, resource-specific withdrawals, and general congressional withdrawal for lands pending final disposition. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows for lands to be withdrawn from development under the \"general congressional\" withdrawal, governed by FLPMA. FLPMA established a federal land use management policy based on a multiple-use approach with public and congressional input. Withdrawals under FLPMA can be temporary or permanent, requiring congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. Proposed withdrawals must be submitted to Congress with detailed reasons, economic and environmental effects, alternatives, consultation efforts, and geological/mineral potential. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years under FLPMA. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or multiple uses. As of November 2000, BLM had completed reviewing around 7 million withdrawn acres. As of November 2000, BLM had completed reviewing approximately 7 million withdrawn acres, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, and some lands may be developed for oil and gas resources while others will likely remain closed or restricted. The review process is continuous and must be supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act."
