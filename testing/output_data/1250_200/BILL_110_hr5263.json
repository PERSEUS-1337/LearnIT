    "content": "The \"Forest Landscape Restoration Act\" aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes to achieve ecological, economic, and social sustainability. It leverages local, national, and private resources to reduce wildfire management costs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Act also highlights the use of forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs and benefit rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" The Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, selects and funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligible proposals must have a complete landscape restoration strategy prioritizing treatments across a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program selects and funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Eligible proposals must prioritize treatments on at least 50,000 acres of forested Federal lands in need of restoration and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The program incorporates the best available science in ecological restoration strategies and requirements for old-growth maintenance and large-tree retention. The collaborative process for ecological restoration projects on Federal lands must involve diverse stakeholders, be transparent, and have a successful track record. Plans should include using fire for restoration, improving wildlife habitat, and not establishing permanent roads. The collaborative process for ecological restoration projects on Federal lands must involve diverse stakeholders, be transparent, and have a successful track record. Plans should include maintenance, improving fish and wildlife habitat, water quality, controlling exotic species, road maintenance or decommissioning, using woody biomass, reporting on performance, and developing small business opportunities in rural communities. The proposal for ecological restoration projects on Federal lands involves activities by local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, and other entities hiring local people. It considers community wildfire protection plans, analyzes cost savings, estimates annual Federal funding needed for implementation. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal involves estimating annual Federal funding needed for ecological restoration treatments, leveraging non-Federal investment, and meeting additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The nomination process requires submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester for each State with covered Federal lands. The nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves State Directors or Regional Foresters nominating projects for selection by the Secretaries. The nominated proposals must include plans to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals must provide evidence of how funds will be used for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. If activities are planned on non-Federal land, evidence of the owner's participation and funding commitment is required. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological restoration strategies, collaborative process strength, and potential reduction of relative risks. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological restoration strategies, collaborative process strength, reduction of relative costs, long-term wildfire management cost reductions, landscape restoration proposal strength, and leveraging non-Federal investment. Limitations include funding up to 10 proposals per fiscal year and 2 proposals per region. Advisory panels, including a scientific advisory panel, will be established. The Secretaries will establish advisory panels to evaluate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals. The scientific advisory panel will assess ecological restoration strategies and wildfire management cost reductions, while the technical advisory panel will focus on rural business development and woody biomass utilization. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to cover 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands for selected proposals. The fund receives appropriations and interest earnings for this purpose. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund covers 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands for selected proposals. The fund receives appropriations and interest earnings. The Secretaries can request transfers from the Fund for restoration treatments. An accounting system is established, and $40,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Implementation work plans and budgets are created within 180 days of selecting a proposal. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal requires an implementation work plan and budget detailing ecological and economic benefits, cost reductions, infrastructure needs, sustainability of biomass supply, and local economic benefits. Non-Federal investment documentation is also necessary. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal requires an implementation work plan and budget detailing ecological and economic benefits, cost reductions, infrastructure needs, sustainability of biomass supply, and local economic benefits. Amounts transferred from the Fund will be used for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the proposal and identified through a collaborative process. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected proposal, including a description of treated acres and progress evaluation. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal includes projects implementing the landscape restoration strategy, progress evaluation, community benefits achieved, multiparty monitoring, and summary of costs for treatments and fire management activities. The Secretaries use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of each project. The Secretaries shall submit a report on the collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal every 5 years to specified committees, assessing the program's fulfillment of its purposes."
