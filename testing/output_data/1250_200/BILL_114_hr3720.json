    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the EPA promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products and enhancing public awareness through outreach and education. The WaterSense program aims to enhance public awareness, establish performance standards, publicize proper installation, preserve label integrity, review criteria regularly, and collect data. The WaterSense program aims to regularly collect data on labeled products, buildings, and landscapes, estimate water and energy savings, solicit public comments before making changes, and provide notice of any revisions. The WaterSense program aims to inform the public about changes, provide explanations, respond to comments, give lead time before new criteria take effect, and consider voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices and promoting recycling technologies. The WaterSense program encourages reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies in various sectors to improve water efficiency. $7,500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2016, increasing to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is addressed in Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" and \"FEMP designated product.\" The terms \"product\" and \"service\" exclude water consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. In accordance with Federal procurement regulations, agencies must procure WaterSense or FEMP designated water-efficient products, with exceptions allowed if justified in writing by the agency head. Installation of WaterSense plumbing products and irrigation systems should be done by certified professionals for optimal performance. The head of an agency may choose not to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products if they are not cost-effective or if no suitable products are available. Agencies must include criteria for WaterSense products in procurement specifications for water-consuming products and systems. The head of an agency must evaluate offers for WaterSense and FEMP designated products, considering measures to reduce water consumption. These products must be clearly identified in federal catalogs, and agencies should prioritize their procurement, except when no suitable products are available. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment of this Act regarding cases where WaterSense or FEMP designated products are not available or cost-effective for the buyer's functional requirements. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" \"incentive program,\" and \"residential water efficient product or service.\" It outlines the criteria for entities to participate in the program and specifies that eligible products must be WaterSense rated for water efficiency and performance. The section outlines criteria for residential water efficient products, including third-party certification through the WaterSense program for water efficiency and performance. Categories of products include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States, including Puerto Rico and Guam. The \"WaterSense program\" is defined as a program established by the Act. Eligible entities must have an incentive program for water-efficient products, submit an application, and provide satisfactory assurances to receive an allocation. The Administrator determines the amount allocated to eligible entities based on population served, targeted population for incentive programs, effectiveness of programs, and unused prior allocations. Entities allocated funds under this program can use up to 50% of the cost for incentive programs. They are encouraged to implement fixture recycling programs. Financial incentives can be issued to consumers meeting program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined based on the entity's allocation and other factors. The entity's allocation under the program considers various factors such as the amount allocated, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and consumer expenditures. Appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020 are authorized for the Administrator to carry out this section. SEC. 5. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a new incentive program under the Internal Revenue Code where individuals can receive amounts under the Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015. No double benefits are allowed, and any excluded amount reduces the adjusted basis of the property. Sec. 139F. Early adopter water efficient products incentive programs. The amendments made by this Act apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date."
