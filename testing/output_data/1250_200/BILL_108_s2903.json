    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are important for youth development, academic achievement, and social skills. Nonprofit organizations strive to prioritize the well-being of young athletes despite the inherent risks of injuries. Participation in school sports and amateur competitions leads to lower obesity levels and promotes better health in adulthood. Rules in amateur sports are essential for maintaining the greater good served by these activities. Rules makers in amateur sports face increasing lawsuits for negligence in adopting or failing to adopt specific rules. Defending these claims can hinder their ability to provide age- and skill-appropriate competition, impacting the overall benefits of sports for youth development and health. Repeatedly defending claims can hinder rules makers' ability to provide services and discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from serving on committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"economic loss\" refers to pecuniary loss from harm, \"harm\" includes various types of losses, \"noneconomic loss\" encompasses nonpecuniary losses, and \"nonprofit organization\" is defined as described in section. The term \"nonprofit organization\" is defined as an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a not-for-profit organization operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. A \"nonprofit athletic organization\" is a nonprofit organization that adopts rules for athletic competitions. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations is provided, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. Employees, agents, and volunteers of these organizations are also not affected by this limitation on liability. Nonprofit Athletic Organizations are protected from liability, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. State laws imposing conditions such as risk management procedures or holding organizations liable for the acts of employees are not inconsistent with this protection. The limitation on liability does not apply to certain claims. The limitation on liability provided by subsection (a) does not apply to certain claims arising from Federal, State, or local laws, including antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or laws protecting from discrimination. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
