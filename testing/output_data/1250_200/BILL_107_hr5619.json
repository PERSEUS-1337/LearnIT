    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Illegal Transshipments Enforcement Act of 2002\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The United States textile and apparel sector, employing 1,000,000 workers, is severely impacted by illegal smuggling and transshipment of products, leading to job losses and billions of dollars in losses annually. China and other Asian countries have a history of illegal exports, while a new method involves evading duties through countries with free trade agreements, exploiting lax enforcement programs. The 1999 Report highlighted the risks of goods in transit, stating that federal officials lack sufficient information to make admissibility decisions. Existing regulations do not provide enough deterrence for criminal violations related to import and export activities. The 1999 Report identified issues with cargo control, including lack of deterrence for criminal violations, bypassing of inspection processes by criminals, insufficient inspectors and investigations, and limited container inspections due to staffing and technology constraints. These issues have negative economic consequences and hinder enforcement of international trade agreements. The purpose of this Act is to establish new guidelines for Customs Service to deter commercial fraud, especially in textile and apparel products, as inspectors only examine about one percent of containers. SEC. 3. Customs enforcement for in-transit goods and cargo theft. The Secretary of the Treasury mandates inspections for a portion of imported containers, requires prearrival electronic filing of documentation, applies technology for screening in-transit goods, verifies exportation documents, and establishes procedures for physical verification of in-transit goods. The Commissioner of the Customs Service will verify in-transit goods exiting the US and coordinate with foreign Customs Services. Random inspections of 1 out of 10 containers after importation are required, along with security checks for employees of freight forwarders and carriers involved in import/export. Establish strict penalties for violations related to in-transit and in-bond textile and clothing goods, including mis-description of products, considered as fraud with penalties equal to the domestic value of the goods. Increase the number of field agents, import specialists, and inspectors dedicated to fraud and cargo inspections. Establish cargo enforcement teams and a fraud enforcement unit within the Customs Service to detect cargo thefts, frauds, and diversions. Conduct all inspections at ports and establish rail inspection facilities at all rail entry points. Establish rail inspection facilities at all rail entry points to ensure container rail traffic is inspected to the same extent as container port traffic. SEC. 4. PUNISHMENT OF CARGO THEFT. Section 659 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to remove the term \"with intent to convert to his own use,\" specify additional modes of transportation, increase the penalty to 3 years, and clarify the definition of goods and chattel in interstate or foreign shipments. The amendment to section 659 of title 18, United States Code removes the term \"with intent to convert to his own use,\" specifies additional modes of transportation, increases the penalty to 3 years, and clarifies the definition of goods and chattel in interstate or foreign shipments. Additionally, the amendment includes an affirmative defense for individuals who bought, received, or possessed goods with the sole intent to report the matter to law enforcement or the owner. The United States Sentencing Commission is tasked with reviewing and amending the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to provide appropriate enhancements."
