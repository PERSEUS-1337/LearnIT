    "content": "Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles, with uncertainty surrounding its health effects slowing down the establishment of drinking water and environmental cleanup standards. Perchlorate has been detected in water in at least 33 states, leading to states setting their own standards ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. Concern has escalated due to perchlorate's persistence in water and its impact on thyroid function, especially near facilities where it is heavily used by the Department of Defense and its contractors. Perchlorate contamination has been found near weapons and rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, research facilities, and military bases, as well as in fireworks, road flares, construction sites, and other manufacturing activities. It can also occur naturally, in organic fertilizer imported from Chile, and as a breakdown product of other products. Perchlorate has been detected in drinking water sources, primarily in the Southwest and scattered locations across the country, with groundwater being the most affected. In 1999, EPA required public water systems to monitor for perchlorate, with 4.1% of systems detecting levels greater than or equal to 4 \u00b5g/L. Perchlorate contamination has been detected in 4.1% of public water systems tested, with levels exceeding EPA's goal in 14 systems. California has extensive monitoring, detecting perchlorate in 241 water sources since 2002. EPA found contamination at various federal and private sites. The Government Accountability Office reported perchlorate detection at 395 sites. Monitoring for perchlorate in foods has also been conducted. In 2004, the FDA tested 500 food samples for perchlorate, finding it in lettuce and bottled milk. In 2005, the FDA expanded testing to find perchlorate in 50% of samples, with higher levels in some foods. Children aged 2 years had the highest perchlorate intake. Perchlorate, found in food, can disrupt iodine uptake in the thyroid, affecting thyroid function. This can lead to health issues like delayed development and decreased learning capacity in fetuses and infants. Studies show that even low levels of perchlorate exposure can impact thyroid function. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants. A 2006 CDC study found that perchlorate exposure affects thyroid hormone levels in iodine-deficient women. EPA has been evaluating perchlorate for a potential drinking water standard due to health concerns. EPA placed perchlorate on the list of contaminants for regulation in 1998 but deemed information insufficient at the time. In 1998, EPA placed perchlorate on the list of contaminants for potential regulation but deemed information insufficient. Further research on health effects and treatment technologies was prioritized, with water systems required to monitor perchlorate under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule in 1999. By January 2007, EPA reported sufficient occurrence data and no further monitoring was deemed necessary for regulatory determination. EPA also issued draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure in 1992 and 1995 to estimate daily oral exposure levels. In developing an RfD, EPA considers factors like sensitive subpopulations, study duration, and data gaps. The draft RfDs range from 0.0001 to 0.0005 mg/kg body weight per day, translating to a drinking water equivalent level of 4-18 ppb. EPA also takes costs, monitoring capabilities, and other sources of perchlorate exposure into account when setting drinking water standards. EPA's 1999 draft risk characterization resulted in a human risk benchmark of 0.0009 mg/kg per day, but the available health effects and toxicity database were deemed inadequate for risk assessment. EPA issued Interim Assessment Guidance in 1999 recommending the use of a reference dose range and drinking water equivalent level of 4-18 ppb for perchlorate-related assessment activities. In 2002, EPA prepared a controversial draft risk assessment on perchlorate exposures, highlighting potential health risks like effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft RfD of 0.00003 mg/kg per day translated to a drinking water equivalent level of 1 ppb, sparking concerns from DOD, water suppliers, and others over cleanup costs and reliance on rat studies. A federal interagency perchlorate working group was convened in 2002 to address regulatory issues and agency concerns. The interagency working group, consisting of various government agencies, requested the National Research Council (NRC) to review the science and EPA's draft assessment on perchlorate. The NRC committee found limitations in using rat studies to assess human health risks from perchlorate exposure and concluded that perchlorate is unlikely to cause thyroid tumors in humans. The NRC committee disagreed with EPA's use of rat studies to assess perchlorate's health risks in humans. They found flaws in the design and methods of the studies and concluded that perchlorate exposure is unlikely to cause thyroid tumors in humans. The committee also criticized EPA's risk assessment model for not accurately representing possible outcomes after changes in thyroid hormone production. The NRC committee recommended using the inhibition of iodide uptake by the thyroid in humans as the basis for risk assessment of perchlorate, leading to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect fetuses of pregnant women at risk of hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency. This recommendation was supported by various studies, including clinical, occupational, and environmental epidemiologic studies. The NRC recommended a reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate based on various studies, including clinical, occupational, and environmental epidemiologic studies. EPA adopted this reference dose in 2005, setting a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb to protect pregnant women and fetuses. EPA may lower this level if considering other sources of exposure, such as food. In January 2006, EPA's Superfund office adopted the NRC reference dose and DWEL of 24.5 ppb as the PRG for perchlorate cleanup. The CHPAC raised concerns about the PRG not protecting infants, recommending a lower PRG and a drinking water health advisory. In October 2008, EPA announced a preliminary decision not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence above health levels. Less than 1% of water systems have perchlorate levels above the health reference level. EPA concluded that perchlorate failed to meet SDWA's regulatory criteria, and sought advice from the NRC before making a final determination on setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate. EPA replaced the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb. Health advisories are nonregulatory but can assist in addressing drinking water contamination. The EPA set an interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for perchlorate contamination in drinking water, based on recommendations from the NRC to protect pregnant women and their fetuses. However, concerns were raised about potential exposure risks for nursing infants. In response, the EPA announced a reevaluation of perchlorate's health effects, focusing on infants and young children. The EPA is reevaluating perchlorate's health effects, focusing on infants and young children. They are seeking public comment on ways to analyze data related to the regulatory determination for perchlorate and considering a broader range of alternatives for interpreting the available data. The agency intends to take public comments into account before making a final regulatory determination. The EPA is reevaluating perchlorate's health effects, focusing on infants and young children. DOD has spent over $114 million on research activities related to perchlorate treatment technologies, detection methods, toxicity studies, and substitutes. Cleanup efforts have been driven by drinking water standards, with ambiguity in cleanup goals and responsibilities due to the lack of a federal standard. DOD adopted a policy setting 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. The DOD policy sets 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. EPA recommends using the interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for cleanup. Legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding perchlorate regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. H.R. 3206 under the Safe Drinking Water Act would require EPA to propose a drinking water regulation for perchlorate within 12 months and finalize it within 18 months. Congress has allocated funding for perchlorate contamination cleanup, including $1.6 million for drinking water wells and $3.5 million for Inland Empire perchlorate remediation. Two bills, H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, focus on studying water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. Two bills, H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, focus on studying water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. H.R. 4252 was passed by the House in March 2010 and ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in July. During the 110th Congress, several perchlorate bills were considered, but none were enacted. S. 24 was introduced to require community water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer reports. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 would have required EPA to set a standard for perchlorate. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address perchlorate contamination in water resources. S. 24 required testing and disclosure of perchlorate in consumer reports, while S. 150 and H.R. 1747 aimed to establish EPA standards for perchlorate. H.Con.Res. 347 urged CDC and FDA to educate the public on iodine intake for protection against perchlorate exposure."
