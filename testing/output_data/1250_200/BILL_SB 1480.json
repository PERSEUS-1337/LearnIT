    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements, including justifying any capital investments for expansion. The assessor may audit the operations of the property owner to verify eligibility for welfare exemption. If property is found ineligible, the assessor must notify the claimant and they can seek a refund of property taxes paid. The property may be ineligible for the exemption, and the claimant can seek a refund of property taxes paid by filing a claim with the county. If the refund claim is denied, the claimant can file a refund action in superior court. Applicants granted a welfare exemption do not need to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes in ownership or use of the exempted property. They must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible or no longer meet the exemption requirements. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. The notice also explains the process to reaffirm exemption eligibility for the next fiscal year. Failure to reaffirm eligibility may prompt the assessor to verify exempt activity. The assessor must review and cancel any incorrectly granted welfare or veterans' organization exemptions on the property. If an exemption was wrongly allowed, an escape assessment will be made with interest and a penalty for failure to notify the assessor. The board will also review the assessor's administration of these exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow counties, cities, and municipal corporations to apply for a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board. Applications must be submitted in writing by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receipt of a timely application. Failure to file a timely application will result in the applicant being barred from relief. Any excess proceeds from delinquent tax sales remaining after distribution under specified sections can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. Unclaimed excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period, with deductions for certain administrative costs."
