    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally, regardless of the transaction method, and collect taxes owed under State law. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require all sellers not qualifying for a small seller exception to collect and remit sales and use taxes for remote sales sourced to that State. Non-Member States can also enforce tax collection with simplification requirements in place. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires states to implement simplification requirements for sales and use tax laws, including a single state-level agency for tax administration, a uniform tax base, and a single tax return for remote sellers. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" mandates remote sellers to collect sales and use taxes based on the destination rate, which includes the State and local jurisdiction rates. It also requires providing software to identify the applicable tax rates and certification procedures for providers. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers to use software and services to collect sales and use taxes based on destination rates. It also holds providers harmless for errors due to reliance on state-provided information, relieves sellers from liability for incorrect tax collection, and mandates a 30-day notice for rate changes by localities. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" mandates that local rate changes must be effective at the start of a calendar quarter. Failure to notify requires holding the seller harmless for collecting tax at the previous rate for 30 days. States must provide updated rate information as part of required software and services. Additionally, a small seller exception allows states to require tax collection if the seller's total remote sales exceed $500,000 in the previous year. SEC. 4 of the Act states that the authority granted will end when the highest court determines the State no longer meets the Act's requirements. SEC. 5 outlines limitations. The Act clarifies that it does not subject sellers to various taxes other than sales and use taxes, does not affect tax application, and does not change state authority on taxes. It also states that obligations under the Act do not determine nexus for taxes other than sales and use taxes. Additionally, it does not impact state licensing, regulatory requirements, or interstate commerce matters. The Act also ensures no new taxes are introduced.

In this Act, definitions include terms like \"consolidated provider\" for tax administration, \"locality\" for political subdivisions, \"Member State\" as per Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, \"person\" as any legal entity, and \"remote sale\" as a sale made by remote sellers.

The curr_chunk explains that a remote sale is sourced to the customer's address provided by the purchaser or obtained during the transaction. If no address is available, it is sourced to the seller's address. States must comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The term \"State\" includes various territories of the United States.
