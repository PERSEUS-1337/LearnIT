    "content": "The \"Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act of 1997\" prohibits the operation of certain cargo-carrying units on federally assisted highways, amending Section 411 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. The \"Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act of 1997\" prohibits states from registering cargo-carrying units longer than 53 feet on certain highways, with exceptions for units manufactured before a certain date. The \"Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act of 1997\" prohibits states from registering cargo-carrying units longer than 53 feet on certain highways, with exceptions for units manufactured before a certain date. The Act also includes provisions for fire-fighting units and repeals certain sections while making conforming amendments for enforcement. The \"Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act of 1997\" amends enforcement provisions in subsection (d) by specifying subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of section 411, and section 2311. SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF DETERMINATIONS OF GRANDFATHER RIGHTS. Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a provision on Grandfather Rights. States are prohibited from allowing the operation of any vehicle not in conformance with Interstate weight limits, unless it is on a published list. The Secretary is required to determine and publish a list of vehicles not in conformance with weight limits but previously allowed before January 1, 1997. The Secretary is required to publish a final list of vehicles or combinations not in conformance with weight limits but previously allowed before January 1, 1997. No operation of any vehicle shall be included on the list based on prior state law authorizations. States can still reduce their gross vehicle weight limitations despite this provision. The subsection allows states to reduce weight limitations on the Interstate System for certain vehicles listed before 1997. All vehicles on the list must adhere to existing state-specific regulations. A conforming amendment removes a sentence from section 127(a) of the title. SEC. 4. NONDIVISIBLE LOAD PROCEEDING. Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to define nondivisible loads and establish regulations for them on the National Highway System to promote conformity with Interstate weight limits for safety. The Interstate weight limits are defined as the 80,000 pound gross vehicle weight limitation, the 20,000 pound single axle weight limitation, the 34,000 pound tandem axle weight limitation, and the overall maximum gross weight on a group of 2 or more consecutive axles. These limits are enforced to ensure safety and conformity on the National Highway System. SEC. 5. WEIGHT LIMITATIONS. Title 23, United States Code, is amended to include new section 127a regarding gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations on non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System. The limitations set by State statute as of January 1, 1997, apply to existing highways, while Interstate weight limits apply to new segments. The legislation also includes a provision for publishing a list of State limitations. The Secretary will publish a list of State gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations applicable to non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System as of January 1, 1997. Additionally, a list of nonconforming operations will be published for vehicles not in compliance with State limitations before January 1, 1997, and were in operation before that date. The Secretary will publish a final list of nonconforming operations for vehicles not complying with State limitations before January 1, 1997. Vehicles on the list must adhere to routing-specific, commodity-specific, and weight-specific designations in force in a State on December 31, 1996. The limitations set by the Secretary apply to new designations on the National Highway System and non-Interstate highways. States can reduce gross vehicle weight or axle weight limitations on existing non-Interstate highways. The Interstate weight limits are defined as 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, 20,000 pounds single axle weight, and 34,000 pounds tandem axle weight. Enforcement of requirements is amended to include sections 127 and 127a. The chapter analysis is updated to reflect these changes. Gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations on non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System are addressed in section 127a."
