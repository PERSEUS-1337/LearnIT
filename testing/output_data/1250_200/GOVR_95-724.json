    "content": "In Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose abortion. The companion case, Doe v. Bolton, further established that states cannot unduly restrict access to abortion. These decisions sparked ongoing debate and led to various governmental actions at different levels. The report provides an overview of abortion law development since 1973, highlighting key Supreme Court decisions like Roe, Doe, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The landmark decisions in Roe and Doe established the constitutionality of abortion rights, leading to ongoing debate and governmental actions. By the mid-19th century, laws began to prohibit abortion at all stages of gestation, with exceptions varying by state. In 1967, most states classified abortion as a felony, with nontherapeutic abortions essentially unlawful. The concept of \"quickening\" was no longer used to determine criminal liability but was retained in some states for setting punishment. In 1967, most states classified abortion as a felony, with nontherapeutic abortions essentially unlawful. The concept of \"quickening\" was no longer used to determine criminal liability but was retained in some states for setting punishment. Abortion laws varied among states, with some allowing exceptions for therapeutic abortions. The first victory of an abortion reform movement occurred in Colorado in 1967, leading to the passage of liberalizing legislation. The movement aimed to allow abortions in cases of grave danger to the woman's physical or mental health, fetal abnormality, or pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. Between 1967 and the Supreme Court's 1973 decisions in Roe and Doe, several states adopted provisions allowing abortions in cases of fetal abnormality, rape, or incest. By the end of 1970, four states had repealed criminal penalties for early pregnancy abortions by licensed physicians. The first U.S. Supreme Court decision on abortion was in 1971, expanding abortion availability under certain health provisions. From 1968 to 1972, many states' restrictive abortion laws were challenged on grounds of privacy violation and equal rights denial. In 1968 and 1972, the constitutionality of restrictive abortion statutes in many states was challenged on grounds of privacy violation and equal rights denial. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton that Texas and Georgia statutes regulating abortion interfered unconstitutionally with a woman's right to decide on pregnancy termination. The Court found that the Texas statute only allowed abortions to save the mother's life, while the Georgia statute permitted abortions in cases of serious threats to the woman's life or health, severe birth defects, or rape-conceived pregnancies. The decisions were delivered by Justice Blackmun, with Justices White and Rehnquist dissenting. The Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton ruled that states cannot ban abortions or make them difficult to obtain. The basis was the Fourteenth Amendment's right to personal privacy, extending to decisions about pregnancy. The right includes fundamental personal rights related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child-rearing. The Court in Roe v. Wade ruled that the right to personal privacy includes a woman's decision on abortion, with state interference requiring a \"compelling state interest.\" The state's interests in protecting maternal health and fetal life were deemed insufficient to justify an absolute ban on abortions, allowing for restrictions only during specified stages of pregnancy. The High Court in Roe v. Wade determined that the state's interest in protecting maternal health becomes compelling at the end of the first trimester, while the state's interest in fetal life becomes compelling at viability, defined as the point when the fetus can potentially survive outside the womb with artificial aid. After viability, the state can regulate or prohibit abortion except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that the abortion decision should be left to the pregnant woman and her physician before the end of the first trimester. After this stage, the state can regulate the procedure to protect maternal health. Post viability, the state can regulate or even prohibit abortion, except when necessary for the mother's life or health. The Court also warned against imposing unreasonable barriers to obtaining abortions. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade established that the abortion decision should be left to the pregnant woman and her physician before the end of the first trimester. The Court also warned against imposing unreasonable barriers to obtaining abortions, striking down state requirements such as abortions being performed in licensed hospitals and approved by a hospital committee. The Court clarified that the word \"person\" in the Fourteenth Amendment does not have any possible pre-natal application. In the 19th century, legal abortion practices were more liberal than today. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade stated that the word \"person\" in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn. The concept of \"viability\" was introduced as the point at which a fetus can potentially survive outside the womb. Post-Roe litigation addressed many unresolved issues. The Court ruled on public funding restrictions for nontherapeutic and therapeutic abortions in the 1977 Trilogy. The Supreme Court decisions in Beal v. Doe and Maher v. Roe clarified that states are not required to provide public funding for nontherapeutic abortions under the Medicaid program. The Court ruled that while states are not obligated to fund unnecessary medical services, they are free to include coverage for nontherapeutic abortions if they choose to do so. The Equal Protection Clause does not mandate states to pay for nontherapeutic abortions simply because they cover expenses related to childbirth. The Supreme Court decisions clarified that states are not required to provide public funding for nontherapeutic abortions under Medicaid. Connecticut's policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was found not to violate the right of privacy. The Court upheld a municipal regulation denying indigent pregnant women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals. The Hyde Amendment's abortion funding restrictions were ruled constitutional. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Hyde Amendment's abortion funding restrictions were constitutional, upholding the right of states to fund only medically necessary abortions under Medicaid. The Court also found that informed consent statutes related to maternal health are constitutional. Informed consent laws related to maternal health must be narrowly defined to be constitutional, as confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1979. These laws should not overly interfere with the physician-patient relationship and may vary based on the pregnancy trimester. In City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the Court struck down a provision requiring doctors to inform women about pregnancy status, fetus development, possible complications, and available assistance for birth control, adoption, and childbirth. The Supreme Court found informed consent laws related to maternal health unconstitutional in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. The Court ruled that requiring doctors to provide information on birth control, adoption, and childbirth interfered with the physician-patient relationship and gave the government too much authority over abortion decisions. Additionally, the Court invalidated a 24-hour waiting period, stating it served no legitimate state interest. The Court also found spousal consent statutes unconstitutional if they allowed the husband to unilaterally prohibit abortion in the first trimester. The Supreme Court ruled that spousal consent laws allowing the husband to prohibit abortion in the first trimester are unconstitutional. Additionally, parental consent laws must provide an alternative procedure if consent is denied, as established in Bellotti v. Baird. In City of Akron, the Court invalidated provisions restricting doctors from performing abortions. In City of Akron, the Supreme Court invalidated provisions that required parental consent for minors seeking abortions, stating that blanket determinations of immaturity were not permissible. In Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City, Missouri Inc. v. Ashcroft, Missouri's parental consent requirement was upheld. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's parental consent requirement for pregnant minors, distinguishing it from the provisions challenged in City of Akron. The Missouri requirement allowed for a court procedure where a pregnant immature minor could demonstrate her maturity or the best interests of having an abortion. In H. L. v. Matheson, the Court examined the constitutionality of a statute requiring parental notice before performing an abortion on a dependent minor. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's parental consent requirement for pregnant minors, allowing for a court procedure for minors to demonstrate maturity or best interests for abortion. In contrast, the Court rejected a minor's argument that abortion was singled out, citing family integrity and adolescent protection. In 1987, a tie vote let stand a decision invalidating an Illinois law requiring parental notification for abortion. Other states have similar laws. In 1989, the Court decided on challenges to state parental notification laws, with a 5-4 decision in Hodgson v. Minnesota upholding Minnesota's requirement. In 1989, the Supreme Court decided on challenges to state parental notification laws. In Hodgson v. Minnesota, the Court held that a Minnesota requirement for notice to both parents prior to a minor's abortion was unconstitutional without a judicial bypass procedure. In Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the Court upheld an Ohio statute requiring notice to one parent with a judicial bypass procedure. The Court clarified that a parental notification statute may not always require a judicial bypass procedure to be constitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled on various aspects of abortion laws, including reporting requirements and advertisement of abortion services. In Danforth, the Court upheld statutes requiring reporting of each abortion performed, as long as it relates to maternal health and remains confidential. In Ashcroft, the Court upheld a pathology report requirement as it aligns with medical standards and important health concerns. Additionally, in Bigelow v. Virginia, the Court ruled that states cannot prohibit advertising of abortion services in other states. In Bigelow v. Virginia, the Supreme Court held that states cannot prohibit advertising of abortion services in other states. In Menillo, the Court ruled that nonphysicians cannot perform abortions, and in City of Akron, an ordinance relating to where abortions can be performed was invalidated. In City of Akron, the Court invalidated an ordinance requiring second trimester abortions to be performed in full-service hospitals, citing financial expense and added health risks for women. The Court also noted advancements in medical procedures since Roe, concluding that the hospitalization requirement imposed an unreasonable burden on a woman's right to abortion. The Supreme Court invalidated Missouri's second trimester hospitalization requirement by a 6-3 vote, citing its decision in City of Akron as controlling. In Simopoulos v. Virginia, the Court upheld Virginia's mandatory hospitalization requirement for second trimester abortions, distinguishing it from requirements in City of Akron and Ashcroft. The Court determined that Virginia's law did not mandate second trimester abortions be performed exclusively in full-service hospitals, allowing outpatient surgical hospitals to qualify. The concept of viability and disposal of fetal remains have required further elaboration. The Supreme Court has elaborated on the concept of viability in relation to fetal remains, emphasizing that viability is the point at which a fetus can potentially live outside the mother's womb with artificial aid for a meaningful life. The Court has left the definition flexible for advancements in medical skill and highlighted the importance of the pregnant woman's doctor in making abortion decisions. In a case involving a Missouri law defining viability, the Court rejected attempts to advance the point of viability to an earlier stage of gestation. The Court disagreed with attempts to advance the point of viability to an earlier stage of gestation, emphasizing that viability is a matter of medical judgment and should be determined by the attending physician. The Court ruled that fetal protection statutes pertaining to pre-viable fetuses were generally overbroad and unconstitutional. In Colautti, the Supreme Court clarified that fetal protection statutes can only apply to viable fetuses and must define the standard for determining viability. The Court emphasized the need for fetal protection laws to specify whether a doctor's duty is to the patient or to balance risks for fetal survival. In Ashcroft, the Court upheld a second-physician requirement in the third trimester to protect viable fetuses. In City of Akron, a vague ordinance regarding disposal of fetal remains was deemed unconstitutional. The 1983 Supreme Court decisions settled questions relating to hospital requirements for second trimester abortions, informed consent, waiting periods, parental notification, and disposal of fetal remains. The Court reaffirmed its decision in Roe and the trimester framework balancing a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy with the State's interest in protecting potential life. The State's interest becomes compelling at viability, defined as when the fetus can survive outside the womb. Roe was reaffirmed in 1986 in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Missouri's abortion statute in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services in 1989. While not overruling Roe, the Court indicated a willingness to apply a less stringent standard to state restrictions on abortion. State legislatures were given considerable discretion to pass restrictive legislation, with the likelihood of such laws passing constitutional muster. Key provisions of the Missouri law included restrictions on public employees and buildings for abortions, as well as requirements for viability testing for abortions after 20 weeks. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion statute in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services in 1989, allowing state restrictions on abortion. The Court did not rule on the Preamble language stating life begins at conception. Chief Justice Rehnquist stated the Preamble did not regulate abortion but expressed a value judgment favoring childbirth. The ruling did not affect private doctors' offices or clinics where most abortions are performed. The decision set the stage for the Court's 1992 decision in Casey. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion statute in 1989, allowing state restrictions on abortion. Chief Justice Rehnquist, along with Justices White and Kennedy, agreed that the required tests for viability at 20 weeks added increased costs to obtaining a second trimester abortion. They proposed a new standard of review for state abortion restrictions, diverging from the trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Kennedy proposed a new standard of review for state abortion restrictions in 1989. They upheld Missouri's abortion statute, finding that the viability testing requirements permissibly furthered the state's interest in protecting potential human life. The plurality questioned the concept of \"viability\" as the basis for regulating abortion and stated that the Missouri law did not limit abortions before viability. They did not believe it was necessary to consider overruling Roe v. Wade. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion statute in 1989, with Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Kennedy proposing a new standard of review for state abortion restrictions. Justice Scalia believed the Court did not go far enough and would have overruled Roe explicitly. Justice O'Connor, part of the majority, did not agree with Justice Scalia's stance but also did not fully align with the plurality, maintaining the trimester framework of Roe. She applied an \"undue burden\" standard and found the Missouri law's viability provision to be constitutional. In 1991, the Court upheld HHS' Title X regulations restricting counseling on abortion for recipients of Federal family planning funding, citing no violation of a woman's right to abortion. The case focused on First Amendment free speech rights rather than the right to abortion. The decision in Rust v. Sullivan energized legislative activity at both the Federal and state levels. Title X.\" Both Webster and Rust energized legislative activity, the former at both the Federal and state levels, and the latter only at the Federal level. Some state legislative proposals that became law were challenged in the courts, e.g., Pennsylvania, Guam, Louisiana, and Utah. The U.S. Supreme Court decided the Pennsylvania case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, on June 29, 1992, reaffirming the constitutional right to abortion with some new restrictions in a 5-4 decision. Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter wrote the opinion, joined in part by Justices Stevens and Blackmun, while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Scalia, and Thomas dissented. The Court upheld Roe and emphasized the importance of following precedent. The Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the right to abortion with new restrictions, introducing the \"undue burden\" analysis. The Court upheld certain provisions of the Pennsylvania statute, including the 24-hour waiting period and informed consent, as constitutional. The Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey upheld certain provisions of the Pennsylvania statute as constitutional, including the 24-hour waiting period and informed consent requirements. The spousal notification provision was struck down as unconstitutional under the \"undue burden\" test. Justices Stevens and Blackmun wrote separate opinions, with Justice Blackmun retaining the strict scrutiny analysis used in Roe. The decision in Casey allowed more state restrictions on abortion to pass constitutional muster. The Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey upheld certain provisions of the Pennsylvania statute as constitutional, including the 24-hour waiting period and informed consent requirements. The decision was significant as it allowed more state regulations on abortion, favoring childbirth over abortion from the outset of pregnancy. Roe's trimester framework allowed for minimal state involvement in the first trimester, but Casey introduced the \"undue burden\" standard, permitting more regulation during that period. The Court's decision in Casey overruled previous cases like City of Akron and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which had struck down certain state regulations. The Court in Casey upheld 24-hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions, applying the undue burden standard. The term \"partial-birth abortion\" refers to a method involving the removal of the fetal body intact, except for the skull. The procedure is a variation of the common D & E abortion procedure, involving dilation of the cervix and dismemberment of the fetus inside the uterus. The partial-birth abortion procedure involves collapsing the skull and removing the fetus intact through the cervix, either head or feet first. It is also known as \"intact D & E\" or \"D & X.\" Concerns have been raised that state bans may prohibit both methods. In Stenberg, a Nebraska physician challenged the state's ban on partial-birth abortion. The Nebraska statute prohibits partial-birth abortions unless necessary to save the mother's life. The term is defined as delivering a living unborn child vaginally before killing it. Violating the statute can result in up to 20 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. Dr. Carhart argued that the Nebraska statute's unclear definition of \"substantial portion\" could include common D & E procedures, leading to a ban on partial-birth abortions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreted the statute to prohibit both D & X and D & E procedures, stating that if \"substantial portion\" refers to an arm or leg, then both procedures are encompassed. The state argued that the statute's knowledge requirement limited its scope. The Nebraska statute was found to apply to both D & X and D & E procedures by the Eighth Circuit, as both involve similar steps leading to fetal demise. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, noting the lack of a health exception for the mother and the undue burden on the right to choose abortion imposed by the statute. The Court found that Nebraska's partial-birth abortion statute imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion due to the lack of a health exception for the mother. The statute covers both D & X and D & E procedures, creating a significant health risk and necessitating a health exception. The Court upheld the Nebraska statute covering both D & X and D & E procedures, rejecting the State Attorney General's interpretation. Justice O'Connor's concurrence suggested that a state statute prohibiting partial-birth abortions could be constitutional with a health exception and narrowly tailored to the D & X procedure. In April 2007, the Court addressed the validity of a statute prohibiting partial-birth abortions, upholding the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. Physicians violating the act face fines, imprisonment, or both. The Court found the federal statute in Gonzales v. Carhart to be constitutional, not vague, and not imposing an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, finding it constitutional and not vague. The act provides doctors with clear guidelines on prohibited conduct, including anatomical landmarks for determining when the act applies. The inclusion of a knowledge requirement alleviates any vagueness concerns. The Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, finding it constitutional and not vague. It concluded that a doctor performing the D & E procedure would not face criminal liability if a fetus is delivered beyond the prohibited points by mistake. The Court determined that the federal statute does not encompass the D & E procedure as it involves the removal of fetal parts in pieces, not the delivery of a living fetus. The Court found that the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 does not apply to the D&E procedure, as it does not involve the delivery of a living fetus. The Court also stated that the act does not impose an undue burden on a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy, even without a health exception. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing medical uncertainty as a basis. Justice Ginsburg dissented, questioning the decision and advocating for exceptions in specific cases. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing safety advantages for women with certain medical conditions. She questioned the decision as alarming and perplexing, noting the lack of a health exception and the Court's departure from precedent. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, arguing that the statute lacking a health exception was unconstitutional. She contended that the decision showed hostility towards the right declared by the Court and burdened constitutional rights."
