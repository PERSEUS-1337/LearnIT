The responsibility for education in these areas was transferred from Israel to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. Palestinian schools have historically used Jordanian and Egyptian textbooks with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. The Palestinian Ministry of Education in the West Bank and Gaza produces textbooks with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, teaching children that Jews and Israel are the enemy. The Israeli government no longer has the authority to change the content of these textbooks. The Islamic Education textbooks for Ninth and Fourth Grade contain anti-Semitic content, portraying Jews as treacherous and inciting civil war. They equate Zionism with Nazism and racism, teaching that Jews do not want peace. The Islamic Education textbooks for Fourth Grade teach children that Jews are enemies, deny the existence of Israel, promote fighting and eliminating Israel through Jihad, and encourage conquering Jerusalem. The textbooks erase any mention of Israel on maps and incite anti-Semitic beliefs. The Islamic Education textbooks promote the use of modern weapons and ammunition, using oil and natural resources as weapons in the battle for liberation. They emphasize the religious imperative to fight Israel and liberate occupied Arab land through Jihad, teaching children to protect mosques and defend Muslim honor. Palestinian Authority Television, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, promotes anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, echoing the hateful portrayal of Jews and Israel found in school textbooks. Publicly funded radio and television broadcasts in the Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank and Gaza also contain similar content. The Palestinian Authority-funded facilities in the West Bank and Gaza promote anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content on television, including messages of Jihad. Despite the US not providing direct aid to the Palestinian Authority since 1995, in fiscal year 2000, $485 million was allocated for development assistance to NGOs in the region, including education programs. Between 1995 and 1998, international aid totaling $226.9 million was provided by 21 countries and 4 international organizations for educational projects in the Palestinian Territories. Additionally, from 1994 to 1999, the European Community committed over $600 million in assistance to the region, including funding for education programs. No assistance will be given to the Palestinian Authority until the President confirms to Congress that anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content has been removed from textbooks and media in the West Bank and Gaza. Congress suggests that allies of the US should also impose similar restrictions on aid."
