The main objectives are to identify and describe major general management laws, assist Members of Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help Congress consider potential changes to management laws and legislation. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining executive branch accountability and influencing federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories for the executive branch. These laws impact federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation and implementation. The report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws, organized into seven functional categories for the executive branch. Most entries profile specific laws, with a focus on Human Resources Management and Ethics laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and issues, along with source readings for further information. Additionally, the report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. The report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Scholars debate their constitutional roles and the balance of power between the branches. The U.S. Constitution establishes separated powers and checks and balances, allowing both Congress and the President to manage the executive branch. The Constitution establishes separated powers and checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws, while the President has considerable power to manage the executive branch. The President has considerable power to manage the executive branch, but this power is limited by the duty to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions. Article II mentions the President's ability to require opinions from department heads and outlines appointment powers. In 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and the federal government's financial management system. In 1789, Congress established the federal government's financial management system and set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Treasury, State, and War. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, created an administrative system with an independent chief executive and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework after coming to power in 1801. After Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans took power in 1801, they maintained the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, which grew in complexity due to the country's expanding size and population. By 1861, federal employment had increased significantly, and executive departments had evolved into more intricate structures. The administrative state grew significantly after the Civil War due to various factors like industrialization, the Progressive Movement, and world wars. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to challenges in managing the executive branch. Agencies were relied upon for policy-making and budgeting, sometimes exercising legislative powers. This shift prompted efforts to improve executive branch management. Observers argued that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to address modern-day executive branch aspects. Legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act (1946) and the Freedom of Information Act (1966) increased transparency in oversight. Congress also established inspectors general (1978) and required agency strategic planning with the Government Performance and Results Act (1993) to improve oversight and accountability. Additionally, Congress sought to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974). The Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) and other laws were passed to improve agencies' financial management. The question arises whether general management laws are necessary for disciplined management or if they stifle flexibility. History can provide insight into this debate, as numerous issues remain for Congress to consider. Before outlining some of the numerous and potentially controversial issues for Congress to consider, scholars have debated the extent to which management practices in the public and private sectors can be compared. While there are points of similarity and overlap, key differences should be recognized and respected. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre famously stated that \"public and private management are fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects.\" One significant difference is that public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different sets of laws. One significant difference between public-sector agencies and private-sector companies is that they operate under different sets of laws. Public-sector agencies are regulated by laws established to prevent arbitrary exercise of coercive power, while private companies are governed by laws that create and regulate a functioning market economy. The laws for public agencies authorize their mission and operations, while laws for private companies generally do not prescribe specific actions or operations. Under the framework of law, a company is primarily accountable to its owners or shareholders. Government agencies differ in that they cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over agency factors is vested in external entities like legislatures and interest groups, making it challenging for agency managers to meet external demands and measure performance effectively. The performance measurement of agencies poses challenges due to differences between public and private sector management practices. The compendium of general management laws raises public policy issues and themes that may require Congress to determine the level of discretion granted to the executive branch in agency actions. Giving discretion can provide flexibility for agencies to tailor implementation to specific circumstances. Giving discretion to the executive branch allows agencies to tailor the implementation of laws to specific circumstances and be more responsive. However, it can also lead to decisions that lack support from Congress and key stakeholders, potentially hindering oversight and intervention. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to decisions by unelected agency officials, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress has faced this tension in granting discretion to agencies, such as in the cases of DHS and DOD in 2002 and 2003, and the FASA in 1994. Scholars have identified four general options for Congress when considering giving discretion to agencies in regulatory matters. Congress can address delegation situations by using contract design and screening mechanisms to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce the risk of adverse consequences. For example, Congress can establish goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, require pilot projects, or create \"profit-sharing relationships\" to incentivize agencies to act in ways that benefit both the agency and the government. Congress can enhance accountability and transparency by requiring agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information for better oversight. Utilizing information technology can enable real-time and frequent updates, although excessive reporting requirements may be burdensome. Institutional checks by Congress can involve additional agencies to veto or block actions of delegated agencies. Standardizing management laws for agencies or having agency-specific laws is a debated issue. The debate over standardizing management laws for agencies or having agency-specific laws continues, with experts suggesting that standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch. For example, the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 aimed to establish basic requirements for agency rulemaking, while the CFO Act of 1990 required major executive departments and agencies to prepare audited financial statements. The Management Reform Act of 1994 and the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended audited financial statement requirements to executive agencies. Standardization promotes accountability, while customization aligns management with internal and external environments. Congress uses statutes and appropriations for agency directives. Congress allows for customization in general management laws, such as exempting small agencies from audited financial statement requirements and granting agencies like DHS and DOD authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems. This mixed approach balances standardization with flexibility, as seen in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans but allowed flexibility in compliance. Different approaches like standardization, customization, and mixed have advantages and disadvantages. Customization can reduce transparency and accountability if not monitored effectively. Mixed approaches can face challenges as well. In addition to the three general approaches of standardization, customization, and mixed, Congress has policy options to avoid problems related to pay flexibility and bidding wars among agencies. Decision-making on approaches depends on various factors, and regular evaluation is recommended for transparency and effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the GAO, and external evaluators. Reducing the analytical burden in situations with widespread customization is also suggested. One option to reduce the analytical burden in situations with widespread customization is to require the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies. This can help Congress and stakeholders monitor the situation more effectively, especially in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Reporting requirements in areas of customization can help in examining the extent of customization and standardization, potentially leading to necessary changes. Reporting could be done in real-time on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS could report on customized management policies to enable government-wide analysis. General management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement. Functional perspectives are crucial for boosting efficiency in organizations, whether structured by customers or taxpayer groups. Functional perspectives are important for efficiency in organizations, but if too inward-looking, coordination and decision-making can suffer. Silos can form, hindering development of general managers. Integrated general management perspective is crucial to avoid missed opportunities. Developing a general management perspective is essential to integrate multiple functional perspectives and achieve a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach combines individual functional viewpoints to create a toolbox of options for executives to address challenges effectively. An integrated general management perspective combines individual functional viewpoints to address executive branch management problems by leveraging various laws and tools for mutual support and integration. The curr_chunk discusses various perspectives such as financial management, budgeting, human resources, acquisition, and program evaluation in order to improve reporting, oversight, and resource alignment within agencies. It suggests utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture for real-time reporting, allocating specific funding for contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts, and developing metrics for assessing staff resources dedicated to contract management. The curr_chunk discusses leveraging functional perspectives for integrated general management, including various areas such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, and human resources management. It highlights past efforts to improve agency performance and management practices through general management laws. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges Congress faces in overseeing executive branch management and the importance of measuring agencies' progress in improving management practices. It emphasizes the role of measurement systems in motivating action but also warns about potential perverse incentives. The curr_chunk highlights the historical challenges in executive branch agencies' management, including financial, acquisition, and human resource issues. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified persistent high-risk areas and major management challenges since 1992. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified high-risk areas and major management challenges in executive branch agencies since 1992. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, with concerns expressed by Congress about government management. Senator Fred Thompson's 2001 report highlighted the urgent need for federal government action. In June 2001, Senator Fred Thompson released a report identifying urgent federal government management problems during President George W. Bush's administration. President Bush's Office of Management and Budget then introduced the President's Management Agenda (PMA) with five government-wide initiatives to address workforce, financial, and technology issues. The PMA includes quarterly evaluations of agencies based on red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" to track progress. The PMA evaluates agency progress with red, yellow, or green status for initiatives. OMB assesses agencies based on deliverables and timelines. Green indicates implementation according to plans, yellow shows slippage, and red signals serious jeopardy. The five initiatives are meant to be mutually reinforcing. The five PMA initiatives are mutually reinforcing and leverage various management laws to achieve their goals. Agencies are making significant progress, but there are observations about measurement practices. Several observations about PMA measurement practices relate to congressional oversight of general management laws. PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch, unlike OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). The stoplight scoring criteria in PMA may introduce subjectivity, such as the standards for success in the Expanded Electronic Government initiative. The PMA requires agencies to meet specific criteria for initiatives like Electronic Government and Human Capital Management. However, independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores. The PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as acquisition-related issues and real property management. This is not the first attempt to improve agency management practices through compliance measurement. Organizations and Congress aim to influence agencies to improve management practices by measuring compliance with general management laws. Agency IGs, GAO, OMB, and Congress have focused on specific problems and created \"high risk\" programs. Representatives have issued letter grades to evaluate agency performance in areas like financial management and information security. Senator Fred Thompson also issued grades for agency annual performance reports. Congress has various options to ensure executive branch agencies improve their management practices. Congress has various options to ensure executive branch agencies improve their management practices, including maintaining current oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs, or implementing independent verification and validation by GAO and agency IGs. Congress has options to enhance oversight of executive branch agencies, such as independent verification and validation of PMA stoplight scores, increased transparency in accessing final PMA stoplight worksheets, and directing GAO or IGs to measure agency progress in management practices. Congress has options to enhance oversight of executive branch agencies by improving management practices in a systematic way, potentially increasing workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies. This could involve amending GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and annual reports, with milestones and timelines for improvement. This option could make management improvement measurement more statutory or systematic, but may also increase workload. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions includes inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions were established by statute in chronological order and head various functions within executive branch agencies. The curr_chunk summarizes key categories of information about agency chief officer positions, including their functions, establishment laws, statutory provisions, appointment rules, and reporting relationships. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by an agency head. Certain positions require political appointments, and reporting relationships vary among chief officers. The history behind the creation of these positions is not detailed in the report. The creation of agency chief officer positions was driven by the belief that senior managers paid insufficient attention to functional perspectives like financial management. Each functional perspective was \"elevated\" to a higher position within agencies to address long-standing problems. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order, with varying memberships and establishment methods. Four councils were established by law, while two exist through executive order. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through executive order. The PCIE aimed to coordinate government-wide activities to combat fraud and waste in government programs. It became a source of leverage for agency Inspectors General (IGs) to secure resources and enhance their independence. Standing committees were formed within the PCIE to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. The PCIE was praised for fostering collaboration among IGs and building informal networks to support organizational learning. However, it was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for agency-appointed IGs. The CFO Council, established by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, is chaired by the deputy director for management (DDM) in the President's Office of Management and Budget. The council initially was passive but became more active in 1994 by broadening membership, electing officers, and setting its own agenda. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act, includes career deputy CFO positions, elects council officers, and sets its own agenda. OMB supports the recommendations. The CFO Council formed committees for special emphasis areas and serves as a model for interagency efforts. Congress later established the CIO Council, CHCO Council, and CAO Council. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. Observers have identified challenges facing officers in improving agency management practices, including high turnover among CIOs, difficulties with change management, and performance measurement. Agencies continue to face management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars caution against functional silos hindering a more integrated management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have been beneficial, with varying levels of effectiveness noted. Public management scholars have increasingly focused on the benefits of interagency collaboration, with a former OMB official testifying to Congress about the importance of councils in improving federal management. Setting up networks of people to share knowledge and best practices is seen as crucial for organizational performance. The concept of \"knowledge management\" has received considerable attention in management literature and various organizations. In management literature and organizations, there is a focus on knowledge management. Scholars and practitioners suggest rethinking the structure and role of OMB in the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers, the preservation of institutional memory, the statutory status of councils, funding, and accountability to Congress. In the context of improving federal executive branch management, questions arise about the need for additional chief security officers (CSOs) to ensure government services are available in emergencies. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles between CSOs and CIOs, but it may enhance overall security responsibilities within federal agencies. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could bring more attention to evaluating program performance and results, addressing potential issues of lack of capacity, management attention, and resources. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams, helping agency efforts to improve performance or coordinate programs with overlapping missions. Chief officer appointments vary in terms of political or career requirements, with recent discussions on the topic in congressional testimony. Political appointees and career officials have differing perspectives on the importance of their roles within agencies. While political appointees can provide a functional perspective to agency leadership, career officials offer continuity and institutional memory across administrations. The CFO Act reflects these perspectives by designating CFOs as political and deputies as career. Reporting relationships for CFOs and CIOs are mandated to report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the next in rank. However, CHCOs and CAOs have reporting relationships left to the agency head's discretion, with arguments for direct reporting to ensure personal access to senior leadership. The agency head's direct reporting relationship aims to provide personal access to senior leadership, but adding more direct reports could overwhelm some executive branch agencies. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory to enhance training, strengthen IG-Congress relations, and improve coordination among federal IG offices. This change could have implications for flexibility and control. The Inspector General Act of 1978 discusses the relationship between IGs and Congress, proposing statutory IG councils to enhance training and coordination among federal IG offices. Funding for interagency councils varies, with some self-financing activities through MOUs and others funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. Operations for the CHCO Council are funded by the Office of Personnel Management. Interagency councils like the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. Congress could maintain the status quo or consider separate appropriations for each council. Altering reporting and strategic planning requirements for these councils is also an option to improve control and continuity. The current lack of reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils like the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils could be addressed by Congress. Implementing reporting requirements to the President or Congress, or requiring OMB to submit an overall plan for leading the councils, could increase transparency and accountability. However, this may limit the President's discretion and increase costs."
