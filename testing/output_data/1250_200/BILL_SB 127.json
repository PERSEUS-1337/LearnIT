    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that many areas in California are disproportionately affected by drought due to reliance on overdrafted or contaminated groundwater. While state programs exist to assist communities with water needs, there is a lack of support for individual homeowners who rely on their own wells and cannot afford necessary water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, and connecting to local systems. The board will establish a program to offer loans and grants for purposes such as extending service lines, paying fees for connections, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury to provide funding for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment for individual homeowners. This includes actions such as closing abandoned septic tanks and wells, deepening or improving groundwater wells, and installing water treatment systems if needed. The fund will receive repayments from grants or loans, including interest payments, for further disbursement by the board according to the program's purposes. An eligible applicant for a loan from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, be unable to secure financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with an interest rate not exceeding 1 percent, secured by a mortgage on the residence. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low household income who own their residence and cannot obtain financial assistance elsewhere. Grant recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund from the General Fund. Ten million dollars is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund for providing eligible households with access to safer drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. This act is deemed urgent for public peace, health, and safety. The Judicial Council shall establish procedures for actions attacking the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects to be resolved within 270 days. Environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in 12-point type. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in 12-point type stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period may not be considered. The reports should also contain the full text of the relevant section of the Public Resources Code and the lead agency must conduct an informational workshop within 10 days of releasing the draft report. Within 10 days before the close of the public comment period, the lead agency must hold a public hearing for testimony on the draft environmental impact report, with a transcript included in the final report. Within five days after the comment period closes, a commenter can request nonbinding mediation, which must end within 35 days. Mediators must be experienced in land use and environmental law, with costs covered by the applicant. The lead agency must conduct mediation sessions for each area of dispute requested by the parties involved. Any agreed-upon measures must be adopted as a condition of approval. Written comments submitted after the public comment period will only be considered if they address new issues, new information released by the agency, or changes made to the project. The lead agency must file notices within five days of project approval and prepare the record of proceedings, with costs covered by the applicant. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of release. Any additional documents related to the report must be accessible within five business days. The lead agency must make an index of copyright protected documents available in electronic format by the release of the draft environmental impact report. Written comments on the project should be submitted in electronic format and made available to the public within five days. Comments not in electronic format must be converted and made accessible within seven days. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must provide a copy of the certified record of proceedings to the superior court for resolution of any disputes. If there is a dispute over the content of the record, the superior court will decide, and a party disputing the content must file a motion to augment the record when filing their initial brief. In granting relief in an action brought under this division, the court shall not stay construction of a water project unless there is an imminent threat to public health or important unforeseen artifacts or values at the project site. If satisfied, the court will only enjoin specific activities that pose a threat or affect the artifacts or values. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency for a subsequent project approval must comply with Chapter 6 (Section 21165). No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies can cover the costs."
