    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. The Act introduces a credit for biodiesel used as fuel in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" introduces a biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate by the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture blends used by the taxpayer. The biodiesel mixture rate varies depending on the blend, with rates set for B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" establishes biodiesel blend categories: B-1 blend (0.5-2% biodiesel), B-2 blend (2-20% biodiesel), and B-20 blend (at least 20% biodiesel). The applicable amount for the B-1 blend is calculated based on the percentage of biodiesel in the blend. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by the taxpayer producing it for fuel purposes in a trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for consideration. The term 'biodiesel' refers to monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils for use in diesel engines, including oils from corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, canola, and crambe. The credit for biodiesel production is reduced to account for any benefits from excise tax exemptions. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. The term 'biodiesel' includes esters derived from various vegetable oils for diesel engines. Biodiesel must meet EPA registration requirements under the Clean Air Act. If biodiesel is separated from a qualified mixture, a tax may be imposed. If biodiesel is separated from a mixture or used in a way other than as fuel, a tax is imposed based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. All applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax. Rules similar to those for estates and trusts apply for pass-thru, and taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit. The rules of subsection (d) of section 52 apply. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit is treated as part of the general business credit under section 38(b). Conforming amendments are made to section 39(d). Conforming amendments are made to section 39(d) regarding the biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The amendment adds a new subsection to Section 4081 regarding the tax rate for biodiesel mixtures. The tax rate is reduced for qualified biodiesel mixtures and diesel fuel used in producing biodiesel mixtures. The amendment introduces a new subsection to Section 4081, which reduces the tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures and diesel fuel used in their production. This includes specific definitions and rules to apply for determining the applicable rates. The amendment introduces a new subsection to Section 4081, reducing tax rates for biodiesel mixtures and diesel fuel used in production. Effective January 1, 2002, the Secretary will pay a specified rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures sold or used in trade. SEC. 4. HIGHWAY TRUST FUND HELD HARMLESS. Transfers from Commodity Credit Corporation funds will offset reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts due to amendments made by this Act, based on Treasury Secretary estimates. Adjustments will be made for any estimation errors."
