    "content": "The Act titled \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" is aimed at addressing early detection and intervention for hearing loss. The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in the United States. It outlines goals such as universal screening for newborns, timely diagnostic testing, and linkage to early intervention services. Public policy should be based on applied research. Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should be based on applied research and consultation with relevant sectors to address the unique language, learning, and communication needs of infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, developing models for effective screening and referral, and collecting data for research and policy development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, identifying causes of hearing loss, and assessing program effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. This includes clinical trials, efficacy studies, and basic research. Sharing data with State-based monitoring programs will help identify unknown causes of hearing loss. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with various agencies, organizations, and professionals to develop policies. The Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health will work together to provide recommendations for policy development at Federal and State levels, as well as with private sector organizations, regarding early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They will also assist States in establishing early detection networks and developing a data collection system. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for Statewide Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Networks.\n- $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n- $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for National Institutes of Health."
