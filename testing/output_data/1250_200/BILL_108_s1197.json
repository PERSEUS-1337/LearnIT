The Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 highlights the importance of regulating medical imaging and radiation therapy to protect public health and safety. Over 300 million imaging exams and treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. It emphasizes the need to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring personnel have proper education and credentials, as well as maintaining accreditation and certification programs at the state level. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. It is crucial for personnel in this field to demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience to ensure public health and safety. The responsibility for regulating these procedures lies with both state and federal governments. In 1981, Congress passed the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act, setting federal standards for education and certification in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Currently, 13 states do not require licensure for these professionals, while others have varying licensing regulations. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license/certify individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure safety and accuracy. States have varying regulations for licensing radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, but no regulation for medical dosimetrists. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. This aims to ensure safety and accuracy in accrediting education programs and licensing individuals in these fields. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation requirements. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national exam approved by the Secretary and meet other specified requirements before performing imaging or therapy. The Secretary certifies private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering exams for imaging or radiation therapy. Minimum standards are set for certification, including recordkeeping and approval of curricula. Approved bodies must provide assurances to meet requirements. The Secretary certifies organizations for accrediting educational programs or exams in imaging or radiation therapy. Approved bodies must comply with set standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information. The Secretary can withdraw certification if standards are not met, but accreditation or exam completion remains valid for a determined period. The Secretary evaluates approved bodies periodically and includes the results in a report to the Senate and House committees. State standards established before new standards are deemed compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. The Secretary must ensure that all medical imaging and radiation therapy programs under their authority meet established standards within 18 months. Alternative standards may be developed for rural areas to ensure access to quality care. The Secretary is authorized to develop alternative standards for rural areas to ensure access to quality medical imaging. Regulations must be promulgated within 18 months to implement this section. Definitions include 'approved body' as a certified nonprofit organization or State agency, and 'medical imaging' as procedures for diagnosing or treating medical conditions in humans. The curr_chunk discusses the terms 'perform', 'plan', and 'radiation therapy' in the context of medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures for diagnosing and treating medical conditions in humans. It defines 'perform' as the act of exposing a patient to radiation or a magnetic field, and 'plan' as preparing for the procedure by evaluating site-specific information. 'Radiation therapy' is defined as any procedure intended for use in curing medical conditions. The curr_chunk defines 'radiation therapy' as a procedure intended for curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing disease in humans through the emission of radiation."
