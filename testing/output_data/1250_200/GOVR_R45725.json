It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues involving the Jones Act include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. National security goals and a national maritime strategy have also been topics of interest. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This law was a restatement of a long-standing restriction dating back to 1789. Congressional attention has been focused on developing a national maritime strategy to increase efficiency and reduce regulatory burdens in the maritime sector. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. The early United States had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber supply, but lost it as wooden ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. trade carried by U.S. vessels, with proposals for foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag known as the \"free ship\" movement. Opponents argued that higher U.S. crew costs would hinder trade resurgence. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress considered bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade but tightened coastwise transport regulations instead. In one instance, a shipper loaded goods on foreign-flag ships bound for Los Angeles via Antwerp to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. In the late 1800s, a shipper used foreign-flag ships to transport goods from New York to Los Angeles via Antwerp to save on freight charges. Congress amended coastwise laws in 1893 and 1898 to prevent shippers from routing cargo through foreign ports. Despite this, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones sought to stop this practice in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 by requiring Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to regulate cargo transportation through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws to cover shipments by land and water between U.S. points. The debate surrounding the Act included the relative cost of building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries, with concerns raised about the impact on American merchant marine if foreign-built ships were banned. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to regulate cargo transportation through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws to cover shipments by land and water between U.S. points. The Act raised concerns about the impact on American merchant marine if foreign-built ships were banned. A 1922 government report on shipbuilding indicated that U.S.-built ships cost 20% more than those built in foreign yards, with the cost differential increasing over the years. Today, the price of a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to be about four times the global price of a similar vessel. The cost of U.S.-built ships has significantly increased over the years, with tankers estimated to be four times the global price. This cost differential is a concern for Department of Defense officials, leading them to opt for used foreign-built cargo ships instead. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign yards, and U.S. crewing costs are higher, resulting in an operating cost differential of over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals for the United States. The act emphasized the need for a well-equipped merchant marine to support national defense and commerce, to be privately owned and operated by U.S. citizens. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of developing a privately owned merchant marine in the United States. This was necessary due to a shortage of ships during World War I, leading to the need for a domestic merchant fleet. The Jones Act, part of this policy, requires U.S. citizen crewing for domestic waterborne shipments, ensuring that a majority of the crew and ownership are American. The Jones Act requires 75% U.S. ownership for corporations owning Jones Act ships. U.S. territories like the Virgin Islands are exempt. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not cargo. Guam requires U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements. Customs and Border Protection defines maritime activity under the act. The Jones Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels for transportation, with the Coast Guard determining what qualifies as U.S.-built based on hull and superstructure components. Other equipment on the vessel does not impact this determination. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards often import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull, not integral to the hull's structure. Certain ship parts can be manufactured abroad if they are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity, but they must be attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be manufactured abroad, including propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels. The Coast Guard permits certain steel products to be imported for U.S.-built vessels as long as they do not exceed the weight limit. Shipyards must confirm with the Coast Guard on using foreign-built components in vessel construction. Determination letters detail permissible foreign components. Shipyard unions refer to vessels built with foreign components as \"kit ships.\" In 2007, unions sued the Coast Guard over interpretation of the statute, but the court sided with the Coast Guard. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sided with the Coast Guard in a lawsuit brought by shipyard unions over the use of foreign components in vessel construction. The court noted that the Coast Guard's interpretation of the Jones Act is consistent with historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. The lawsuit was prompted by a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships using foreign designs and procurement services. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with a South Korean shipbuilder to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act ships, raising concerns about undermining the policy objective of domestic shipbuilding capability. The Jones Act policy objective of domestic shipbuilding capability is undermined by the use of foreign components in ship construction, as argued by shipyards in a court case. The largest cruise ship market in the United States sees most Americans boarding foreign-flag cruise ships due to regulatory interpretations exempting them from Jones Act compliance if they visit distant foreign ports. This exemption was based on a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. government. The 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports as long as they include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Passengers must continue with the cruise until it terminates at the same dock where it began. Another type of passenger vessel excursion involves \"voyages to nowhere,\" where passengers do not visit any other ports besides the one at which they embark and disembark. If these vessels stay within the 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters, CBP has determined that the Jones Act is not violated. CBP has determined that if vessels stay within the 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters, they must be Jones Act-compliant. However, if vessels venture beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. Charter fishing boats must still be Jones Act-compliant even if they go into international waters. CBP's definition of a passenger does not require them to be a paying customer. The CBP's definition of a passenger on passenger vessels includes anyone aboard who is not a crew member or owner. This impacts various industries like construction, offshore oil, and lightering operations. Lightering vessels within 3 nautical miles of shore must be Jones Act-compliant. Lightering vessels in the Delaware Bay and other areas within the 3-mile zone must be Jones Act-compliant. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points\" within the 200-mile offshore zone. Foreign-flagged vessels were allowed to service mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) not attached to the seabed until 2008 when Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers to oil rigs or installing equipment. Vessels laying cable/pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant, while those involved in installing rig equipment or conducting surveys can be foreign-flagged. Flotels providing living quarters for workers can also be foreign-flagged. In 2017, CBP proposed that most activities by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but withdrew the proposal after review. Questions arise regarding the application of the Jones Act to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers either transport equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-compliant TIVs for installation. The CBP interpretation of the Jones Act allows for non-Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport merchandise that is transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port. This has been significant in shaping coastal maritime activity, particularly in cases like a Texas oil producer shipping a product to a Bahamian facility for blending before shipping to New York. Foreign-flag tankers are permitted for these shipments, even if a portion of the cargo travels between two U.S. points. This interpretation is based on a 1964 Customs Service ruling. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners could no longer qualify under the Jones Act. Congress expanded the Act in 1940 to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels. In 1988, waterborne transport of valueless material was specified. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including allowing foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports. Congress has also permitted certain foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011. In 1996 and 2011, Congress allowed certain foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service due to a lack of Jones Act fleet vessels. Exemptions have also been enacted for vessel shortages during specific events like a surge in steelmaking for the war effort in the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. Additionally, exemptions were made for oil spill cleanup operations and innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade but with domestic cargo operations. In 1971, Congress exempted river barges used for international voyages from the Jones Act. This exemption is no longer relevant as the technology is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments from the Jones Act. Jones Act-compliant ships are needed for transshipment of loaded international containers, impacting the development of marine highways. The lack of transshipment services in the U.S. increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships. Congress has granted exemptions for specific vessels, with at least 133 waivers issued since 1989. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and do not always specify the reason for the exemption or the type of vessel. Waivers have been granted for 67 vessels and another for 35 vessels, with most not being commercially significant. Some vessels are owned by nonprofit entities. In some cases, waivers are needed due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. Domestic shipping restrictions were waived during World War I and World War II, with Congress granting waivers for national defense interests in 1950. Waivers were also granted in 1991 and 2011. The Jones Act has been waived for national defense reasons, allowing expedited oil shipments and fuel resupply during military conflicts and natural disasters. MARAD now checks vessel availability before granting waivers, and waivers have been granted for lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act waivers for national defense reasons have allowed expedited oil shipments and fuel resupply during military conflicts and natural disasters. The waivers have been granted for specific instances, such as transporting a radar system from Texas to Hawaii and an oil rig from the Gulf Coast to Alaska. However, waivers have been denied for transporting replicas of Christopher Columbus's vessels and for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, despite safety concerns raised by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. CBP has emphasized that national defense waivers are not issued for economic reasons, such as commercial practicality or expediency. In 2018, the United States exported between 40 million and 80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. This situation is also occurring with liquefied natural gas (LNG), as the United States has begun exporting substantial amounts. The Jones Act fleet in the United States faces challenges with LNG shipping, as there are no LNG tankers in the fleet. Puerto Rico is seeking a waiver to receive LNG shipments from the mainland. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, but the fleet falls short of the desired merchant fleet. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, primarily tankers. The Jones Act-compliant fleet in the U.S. consists of 99 oceangoing ships as of March 2018, with tankers being the largest category. The fleet includes various types of ships such as container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and general-cargo vessels. The number of oceangoing ships in the Jones Act fleet has decreased significantly since 1950, with a notable drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a significant drop in the size of the U.S. merchant marine fleet. The Secretary of Transportation in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, stating that the fleet was too small, old, and unproductive. Despite economic advantages, domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines, even though they can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel. Many shippers prioritize lower costs over transit time. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where shippers have limited alternatives, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Despite aiming to sustain a growing merchant marine, the fleet does not meet the policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. The fleet struggles to achieve these objectives, raising questions about its effectiveness. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. \"Project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels are not represented in the fleet, hindering its ability to move specialized equipment. The Department of Defense uses waivers to move certain cargo on foreign-flag vessels due to the higher cost structure of Jones Act operators. Only two dry bulk ships are in the fleet, but they are mostly inactive due to their age. The Jones Act fleet lacks modern vessels, with two dry bulk ships being nearly 40 years old. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, there are no LNG tankers in the fleet. The high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships has led to the development of articulated tug barges (ATBs) as a unique vessel design. Over 150 ATBs are estimated to be operating in the Jones Act trades, but they are less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. ATBs are less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships due to their slower speed and smaller size. The notch between the barge and tug creates more resistance through the water. ATBs carry more cargo, predominantly oil, on coastal voyages. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in 2015, had open lifeboats instead of closed lifeboats with auto launchers. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet beyond the El Faro incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet beyond the El Faro incident, as findings indicate substandard conditions in other vessels. The Jones Act fleet has older ships that are more prone to breakdowns, with some ships being over 21 years old. In February 2019, the crew of the 46 year-old Jones Act containership Matsonia found a crack in the hull, highlighting maintenance issues in the fleet. The Jones Act-compliant vessels in the Great Lakes are older, with the largest ships built between 1972 and 1981. The fleet includes dry bulk ships carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal for steelmaking. The U.S. Lake Carriers Association notes that freshwater ships have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Great Lakes fleet has declined in tonnage since the 1950s, with Canadian ships also facing similar challenges. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet faced challenges due to vessel import policy, with a 25% tariff on newly constructed imported ships leading to no new additions to the fleet. After repealing the tariff in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships were constructed in other countries for service on the Great Lakes. The U.S. inland river fleet consists of tugs, pushboats, dry cargo barges, and tank barges, mainly transporting corn, soybeans, coal, and liquid bulk cargoes. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. The export of corn and soybeans and domestic movement of coal dominate the U.S. inland river fleet. A leading barge manufacturer ceased operation in 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. The Jones Act was amended in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise\" for domestic vessel transportation. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. Federal spending on navigation dredging has increased by several hundred million dollars per year over the last decade without significant results. The increase in federal spending on navigation dredging over the last decade has not led to a larger volume of material being dredged from U.S. harbors. Factors such as limited supply of dredging vessels, rising costs of fuel, steel, and labor, and stricter environmental requirements contribute to cost increases. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms, with European firms having larger and more modern fleets. When the Army Corps bids harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is often the sole bidder. The European fleet is younger and larger compared to the U.S. fleet. When the Army Corps bids harbor work, one of the four U.S. firms is often the only bidder. Dredging projects may face a shortage of dredges at times. Mobilization and demobilization costs can make up a significant portion of project expenses. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transporting dredge fleets, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet in 2017 consisted of about 1,800 vessels, mainly operating in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction of rigs in deeper waters relies on foreign-built vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems for construction in deeper waters, hindering wind tower installation. Congress has yet to issue a national sealift strategy despite concerns over the shrinking U.S. mariner pool's ability to crew a reserve fleet. The Jones Act oceangoing ships' crews, along with other U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and Military Sealift Command fleet, would be called upon to support military sealift. MARAD estimates the total mariner pool needed to crew the government-owned reserve fleet for military sealift purposes. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for prolonged sealift efforts, despite a sufficient pool for immediate surges. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in the past. The Jones Act's maritime policy aims to have a commercial fleet that can provide sealift during wartime. Three fleets - RRF, MSC, and MSP - support military sealift, with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF has 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing 1,200 more when activated. MSC controls about 50 ships for military cargoes, mostly crewed by civilian mariners. MSP receives a subsidy for American crews and relies on government cargoes. The military sealift fleet heavily relies on government cargoes reserved for American crews, as per the \"cargo preference\" law. While Jones Act operators must use costly U.S.-built ships, the sealift fleet mainly consists of more affordable foreign-built ships. There is a suggestion to domestically build the sealift fleet to increase competitiveness and support U.S. shipyards. The military sealift fleet prefers versatile cargo ships with flexible capabilities, such as ramps or onboard cranes, to handle various cargo types and sizes. This preference conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost considerations. Container ships without onboard cranes have largely replaced general cargo and break-bulk ships in the military sealift fleet. The shift from versatile cargo ships with onboard cranes to container ships without cranes has impacted commercial mariners' experience. Larger container ships require more water depth than many ports can provide, and cost pressures have led to engines that prioritize fuel efficiency over speed. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have also influenced the use of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, creating a disparity between military vessel designs and commercial trends. The Jones Act contributes to military sealift by preserving a shipyard industrial base with the knowledge and skills to build and repair ships. U.S. shipyards typically build only a few oceangoing ships per year, leading to gaps in orders for container ships. One shipyard that builds commercial ships has seen a decline in employment and no vessels under construction as of March 31, 2019. The government-owned sealift fleet is aging, with many vessels in need of repair. There is a lack of large dry docks to service the fleet, delaying their readiness to sail. Some ships in the reserve fleet have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy, with examples of hull damage found during readiness exercises. The Navy plans to recapitalize the reserve fleet by building new vessels in domestic shipyards and repairing existing ships. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels in domestic shipyards, repairing ships to extend their service life, and purchasing used foreign-built ships. Repairing vessels has been more expensive and time-consuming than projected, leading to consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs."
