    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act.\" The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings. The United States leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. Additionally, the number of nonfatal unintentional firearm injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms annually is significantly higher. In the United States, children as young as 3 years old are capable of firing most commercially available handguns. Currently, firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards in the country. A 1997 poll found that 74% of Americans support safety regulation of the firearms industry, as firearms and safety locks involved in interstate commerce are often inadequate to prevent accidental discharge or children accessing them. SEC. 3. REGULATION OF HANDGUN DISCHARGE PROTECTION PRODUCTS. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. The regulations must establish a minimum safety standard for these products, ensuring they are of high quality and cannot be easily removed from a handgun without proper authorization. The Secretary of the Treasury must regulate handgun safety products to prevent injury to children. The standard must ensure these products are secure and can only be accessed with authorized methods. Test protocols for poison prevention packaging may be considered. The standard must be issued within 12 months and take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS.

Private enforcement of the Act allows any interested person to bring an action in a US district court to enforce the Act or restrain violations. The court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Compliance with the Act does not relieve liability under common law or State law, and the Secretary's failure to take action is not admissible in litigation. Under this Act, evidence of the Secretary's failure to take action is not admissible in litigation. Criminal penalties include fines and imprisonment for knowingly violating provisions of the Act regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW.
