    "content": "The \"Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Department of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program on dog training therapy. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program to assess the effectiveness of using service dogs to address post-deployment mental health and PTSD symptoms in veterans with disabilities. The program will run for five years at three to five VA medical centers, providing training areas for educating veterans in service dog training and handling. These areas will include indoor grooming and training spaces, wheelchair accessibility, and classroom facilities. The pilot program for using service dogs to address post-deployment mental health and PTSD symptoms in veterans with disabilities will include indoor grooming and training spaces, wheelchair accessibility, classroom facilities, office space for staff, storage for training equipment, outdoor exercise areas, and transportation for field trips. The program will be administered through the Recreation Therapy Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs by a certified recreational therapist and a director of service dog training. The pilot program for using service dogs to assist veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder includes selecting dogs from shelters or foster homes with suitable temperament and health clearances. Certified instructors will teach essential commands to the dogs at the program site or volunteer foster homes. The pilot program for training service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder includes ensuring dogs live at the program site or nearby foster homes, providing hands-on training, maximizing therapeutic benefits, and offering well-trained service dogs to veterans with disabilities. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder can volunteer if resources are available, and they may participate alongside the compensated work therapy program. Hiring preference is given to service dog training instructors. The Department of Veterans Affairs pilot program gives hiring preference to veterans who have graduated from treatment programs and received certification in service dog training. Data collection will assess the program's effectiveness in reducing stigma, improving emotional regulation, patience, purpose, community reintegration, and social isolation for veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs pilot program aims to help veterans by reintegrating them into the community, exposing them to new environments to reduce social isolation, building relationship and parenting skills, relaxing hyper-vigilance, improving sleep patterns, and decreasing the use of pain medication. Reports to Congress will detail the number of participants, services provided, and the effects on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and post-deployment adjustment difficulties. The curr_chunk discusses symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, physiological markers related to service dogs, family dynamics, insomnia, pain management, and overall well-being. It also includes the definition of a service dog training instructor."
