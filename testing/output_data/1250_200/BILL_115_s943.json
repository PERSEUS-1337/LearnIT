The Secretary, in consultation with eligible entities, determines the number of eligible Indian students served by each entity using accurate data from the preceding fiscal year. The Secretary, in consultation with eligible entities, determines the number of eligible Indian students served by each entity using accurate data from the preceding fiscal year. To improve accuracy before publishing, the Secretary reconciles the data with each existing contracting party's data and identifiable tribal enrollment information. The Secretary establishes a 60-day comment period for feedback on the preliminary report from eligible entities. A final report on the number of eligible Indian students served by each entity is published within 120 days after consultation. Subsequent academic years require determinations for eligible students served by contracting parties. The Secretary determines the number of eligible Indian students served by contracting parties based on reported student count numbers. Contracting parties must submit a report on eligible students served and funds expended, failure to comply results in no funding. The Secretary shall provide contracting parties with timely information on reporting deadlines and consequences of non-compliance. Technical assistance and training will be provided to ensure compliance with reporting requirements. Additionally, an annual report will be prepared, including the number of eligible Indian students served, funding recommendations, and an assessment of contracts under the Act. The Secretary will provide funding recommendations for the program in the budget request, submit reports to specific committees, and make them publicly available.

If funds are insufficient, the Secretary will ratably reduce amounts for all parties. This provision will sunset 4 years after the Act's enactment, with a maximum decrease in funding after that period. Beginning 4 years after the JOM Modernization Act's enactment, contracting parties cannot receive more than a 10 percent decrease in funding per eligible Indian student from the previous fiscal year. The Secretary may recommend legislation to increase funds per student to 1995 levels and explore additional funding sources without reallocating existing funds. Increases in program funding are subject to certain conditions. Increases in program funding under the JOM Modernization Act are allocated to contracting parties that did not receive their full per student funding allocation in the previous fiscal year.
