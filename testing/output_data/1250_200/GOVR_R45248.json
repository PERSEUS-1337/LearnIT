    "content": "Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), agencies must submit reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before rules can take effect. Major rules require additional time for Congressional review, with GAO assessing agency compliance. Congress can use expedited procedures to overturn rules, primarily in the Senate. Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), expedited procedures in the Senate allow for quick overturning of rules. A joint resolution disapproving a rule can be passed with a simple majority, with no amendments permitted. If both houses pass the resolution and the President signs it (or Congress overrides a veto), the rule will not take effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for quick overturning of rules through expedited procedures in the Senate. If a joint resolution disapproving a rule is passed by both houses and signed by the President (or if Congress overrides the President's veto), the rule will not take effect. The CRA reinstates the status quo prior to the rule's issuance and prohibits the issuance of a rule in substantially the same form unless authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA applies to rules issued by most executive branch entities, as defined by the APA. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for quick overturning of rules through expedited procedures in the Senate. The CRA generally covers rules issued by most executive branch entities, excluding actions of the President. The CRA adopts a broad definition of \"rule\" from the APA, but creates exceptions to that definition. The CRA defines \"rule\" broadly as regulations affecting rates, prices, services, or accounting practices. Exceptions include rules of particular applicability, agency management, and organizational procedures not impacting non-agency parties. Determining if an agency action falls under the CRA involves assessing if it meets the APA definition of a rule and if it fits any exceptions. The CRA defines \"rule\" broadly as regulations affecting rates, prices, services, or accounting practices. Exceptions include rules of particular applicability, agency management, and organizational procedures not impacting non-agency parties. To determine if an agency action falls under the CRA, it must meet the APA definition of a rule and fit any exceptions. The APA's definition of \"rule\" is expansive but courts have distinguished rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. An agency statement must meet requirements of general applicability, future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy to qualify as a rule. The CRA exempts three categories of rules from its provisions. Both inquiries are fact-specific and require looking beyond a document's label to its substance. The CRA defines \"rule\" broadly as regulations affecting rates, prices, services, or accounting practices. Exceptions include rules of particular applicability, agency management, and organizational procedures not impacting non-agency parties. The APA distinguishes different types of agency actions, separating rules from orders and investigatory acts, which may be relevant when deciding if an agency action is subject to the CRA. Orders are the outcome of agency adjudication, resolving specific disputes among individuals, while rules result from rulemaking and affect broad classes of individuals. Courts determine whether an agency action is a rule or an order based on the substance of the action, not just its label. Adjudications have immediate effects on specific individuals involved in the dispute, while rulemaking is prospective and affects individuals only after the rule is applied. Additionally, rules are distinguished from agency investigations, which involve the authority to compel information submission and perform investigative acts. The APA addresses an agency's authority to compel information submission and perform investigative acts. Courts have held that investigative actions are not subject to rulemaking requirements, but some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules. An agency statement qualifies as a \"rule\" if it is of general or particular applicability, has future effect, and is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The ambiguity lies in the requirement that a rule be of future effect. The APA defines a rule as an agency statement that is of general or particular applicability and has future effect. Courts have interpreted the \"future effect\" requirement to mean that rules only have legal consequences for the future, distinguishing them from retrospective orders. This distinction is crucial in determining whether an agency statement qualifies as a rule. Judge Silberman of the D.C. Circuit argued that not every agency statement with future effect should be considered a rule under the APA. He suggested that only statements that \"authoritatively answer an underlying policy or legal issue\" should be classified as rules. However, there are unanswered questions regarding what it means for a statement to be binding and how to differentiate this requirement from the need for notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. The legal effect test for notice-and-comment rulemaking determines if a rule binds an agency, while the future effect inquiry tests if an agency action is a \"rule\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4). These tests are tied to distinct statutory provisions and should not both rely on whether a rule is legally binding. Interpretive rules may not require notice-and-comment but are still considered \"rules\" under the APA. The APA outlines specific rulemaking procedures that agencies must follow when formulating, amending, or repealing a rule. Courts have held that interpretive rules may not require notice-and-comment but are still considered \"rules\" under the APA. The D.C. Circuit has also determined that agency documents that do not change existing law or policy are not considered rules. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies to follow, including notice-and-comment rulemaking. However, not all agency acts classified as \"rules\" require compliance with these procedures. Certain agency statements like guidance documents may be considered APA \"rules\" but are exempt from notice-and-comment requirements. Courts often exempt agency guidance documents from APA notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements, categorizing them as interpretive rules or general policy statements. Interpretive rules clarify existing obligations without imposing new ones, while general policy statements describe an agency's enforcement discretion without legal binding. The key factor distinguishing these from legislative rules is whether they have the force of law. General policy statements are typically not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not even be considered \"rules\" under the APA definition. The D.C. Circuit has debated whether general policy statements qualify as \"rules\" under the APA definition, with some cases suggesting that they may not bind agencies and therefore do not have future legal effect. While some decisions have classified general policy statements as APA rules despite lacking legal binding in future proceedings, the relationship between binding effect and the APA's requirement for rules to have future effect remains unclear. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" by reference. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" by reference, potentially incorporating judicial constructions of that definition. Some courts have imported the APA's distinction between rules and orders when interpreting the CRA. The CRA may not apply if an agency acts through an order or investigatory act instead of a rule. There is debate over whether guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules,\" as the term \"guidance document\" is not defined under either the CRA or the APA. Even if labeled as guidance, agency statements like memoranda or letters may still qualify as \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" by reference, potentially incorporating judicial constructions of that definition. Agency guidance documents that are exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment procedural requirements may nonetheless be subject to the CRA. The CRA may apply to agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment requirements, but their disapproval may have limited effect as these documents often lack legal impact. The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA suggests it was intended to cover a broad range of agency actions, as stated by the law's sponsors in the Congressional Record. The CRA may apply to agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment requirements, but their disapproval may have limited effect as these documents often lack legal impact. Congress intended the CRA to reach a broad range of agency activities, including agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization, despite not being subject to the APA's requirements for notice and comment. GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA applies to agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment requirements, but disapproval may have limited effect as these documents often lack legal impact. The CRA reaches a broad range of agency activities, including policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization. GAO advises Congress on which agency actions are subject to the CRA, with exemptions for rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel, and rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The CRA does not apply to rules concerning monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, and has exceptions for rules where notice-and-comment procedures are dispensed with for good cause. The CRA exempts rules from notice-and-comment procedures for \"good cause\" and for rules related to hunting, fishing, or camping. It allows agencies to determine when a rule takes effect, despite CRA requirements. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specific parties. GAO has clarified that a rule only needs to have general applicability within its intended range to be considered generally applicable under the CRA. The CRA exempts rules from notice-and-comment procedures for \"good cause\" and for rules related to hunting, fishing, or camping. It allows agencies to determine when a rule takes effect, despite CRA requirements. GAO has clarified that a rule only needs to have general applicability within its intended range to be considered generally applicable under the CRA. Examples of rules of particular applicability include those that approve future rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, mergers, or accounting practices. IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular applicability. Service letter rulings and agency actions designating specific sites as covered by environmental laws are examples of rules of particular applicability. The APA and CRA have exemptions for rules relating to agency management or personnel, with the APA exemption covering internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside an agency. It is unclear if the substantial-effect requirement developed by courts in the APA context should be applied to the CRA. The CRA's second exemption for rules relating to agency management or personnel may be interpreted more broadly than the APA exception, as it does not mention a rule's effect on third parties. This could mean that the CRA's second exception excludes such rules regardless of their impact on third parties, potentially displacing the ordinary presumption that Congress incorporates case law interpreting similar statutory provisions. Congress may have omitted the substantial-effect requirement in this exemption due to prior judicial interpretation of identical phrases in the APA. The CRA's second exemption for rules relating to agency management or personnel may be interpreted broadly, potentially displacing case law interpreting similar statutory provisions. Congress omitted the substantial-effect requirement in this exemption due to prior judicial interpretation of identical phrases in the APA. The CRA exempts rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations, similar to the APA's exclusion. Courts have interpreted this APA exception to include agency decisions on how regulated entities must satisfy investigative requirements. The CRA exemption for rules relating to agency management or personnel may require consideration of the law defining the requirement. Courts use the substantial impact test to distinguish between substantive and procedural rules, considering whether the rule encodes a substantive value judgment. The CRA excludes rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The CRA mandates the use of a substantial impact test to determine if a rule affects non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The exclusion under the CRA covers rules with a minor effect on non-agency parties. GAO sometimes uses APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA. The substantial-impact and substantive-value-judgment tests from the APA may not directly apply to determine CRA applicability. Agencies must submit actions falling under the CRA's rule definition to Congress and GAO. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect, including a report with details on the rule, cost-benefit analysis, and regulatory impact analysis. GAO assesses compliance with these requirements for major rules. The GAO assesses agencies' compliance with additional informational requirements for major rules and includes its assessment in the major rule report, which must be submitted to Congress within 15 days of the rule's submission or publication. Agencies use a two-page form to provide required information, with OMB issuing a standard form in 1999 for compliance with the CRA. Congressional Record includes notice of each chamber's receipt and referral of final rules. Submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is crucial as it triggers expedited procedures for considering a resolution of disapproval. Failure to submit a rule hinders the House and Senate from using fast-track procedures to strike down the rule. Members have raised concerns about agencies not submitting rules in the past. Following the enactment of the CRA in 1996, concerns were raised about agencies not submitting their rules as required. Hearings in 1997 and 1998 highlighted issues with agency compliance, leading Congress to require OMB to issue guidance on the submission requirement. OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum in 1999 to improve agency compliance with the CRA. The GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance with the submission requirement under the CRA by comparing final rules published in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO. This review was conducted voluntarily to ensure accuracy and agency compliance with the statute. Entities may have been misled about the effectiveness of rules published in the Federal Register, as they were only valid if filed in accordance with the statute. GAO reviewed agency compliance with the submission requirement and submitted a list of rules not filed to OIRA. GAO criticized OIRA for not being proactive in ensuring agencies were aware of filing requirements. GAO continued to monitor agencies' submissions until 2012 when they stopped sending lists due to resource constraints. In March 2012, GAO informed OIRA that it would no longer send lists of rules not received due to resource constraints. GAO decided to track only major rules not received, rather than all final rules as before. Agencies generally submit rules to Congress and GAO comprehensively, especially those promulgated through an APA rulemaking process. However, compliance with submission requirements for rules not subject to notice-and-comment procedures is more challenging to track. GAO's methodology for tracking agency compliance did not result in a complete list of actions that should have been submitted. Comparing regulations published in the Federal Register against those received pursuant to the CRA was GAO's reference point. The Federal Register is used as a reference point by GAO to identify rules not submitted under the CRA. However, many agency actions not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not published in the Federal Register or submitted to GAO. This led to undetected noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement, especially for rules outside the rulemaking process. The practical difficulty of submitting numerous agency statements qualifying as rules contributes to the higher incidence of noncompliance. The practical difficulty of submitting a substantial number of agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA has led to challenges in the rulemaking process. The submission requirement includes a wide variety of items, such as FAQs, press releases, bulletins, and statements made by agency officials. Agencies take tens of thousands of actions annually that could fall under the CRA's definition of a rule, overwhelming Congress and the GAO with filings if fully complied with. This could potentially divert attention from larger, controversial matters, and impose significant aggregate costs for data analysis and tracking. The submission requirement under the CRA includes various agency statements like FAQs, press releases, and bulletins. Many agencies may not be fully aware of the CRA's coverage beyond notice-and-comment rules. GAO has highlighted instances where agencies have incorrectly classified guidance documents as non-binding, stating that these documents should be submitted under the CRA. The GAO disagrees with HHS's stance that guidance documents are not considered rules under the CRA. Congress's ability to review rules could be hindered if agencies do not submit them. The Senate has a practice of seeking GAO opinions on whether agency actions should have been submitted under the CRA. GAO has issued 21 opinions on this matter as of March 5, 2019. The GAO has issued 21 opinions regarding agency actions that should have been submitted under the CRA. The Senate relies on GAO opinions to determine the initiation and action periods for disapproval resolutions. This allows Congress to use the CRA's expedited procedures to overturn rules without the actual submission of a rule. The GAO has played a crucial role in determining the applicability of the CRA by providing opinions on agency actions. It has voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA, going beyond its statutory requirements. The GAO voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA to facilitate implementation, going beyond its statutory requirements. The database allows searching for rules by various elements and contains links to major rule reports. The GAO's determination of whether agency actions are considered \"rules\" under the CRA is closely linked to monitoring agency compliance with the submission requirement. The GAO's role in determining agency compliance with the submission requirement under the CRA was highlighted in a congressional hearing on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997. GAO's general counsel testified that the plan should have been submitted as a rule under the CRA, indicating the voluntary nature of GAO's involvement in this regard. The GAO's general counsel clarified their role in advising Congress and agencies on policy decisions, stating that they do not have a special role in determining what constitutes a rule under the CRA. Their recent opinion on the Tongass Land Management Plan was provided in response to a request from congressional committees, not based on a specific statutory provision. GAO acknowledged that its opinion on the applicability of the CRA was provided in an advisory capacity in response to congressional requests. Despite issuing 21 opinions since 1996, Congress's response varied over time, with joint resolutions of disapproval not introduced until 2008 following a GAO opinion on a letter from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 in response, but the Committee on Finance did not take further action. The Committee on Finance did not take further action on S.J.Res. 44 to disapprove guidance due to missing the window for expedited procedures. The House and Senate passed resolutions of disapproval in 2012 and 2018, respectively, based on GAO opinions. The President signed S.J.Res. 57 into law overturning guidance from the CFPB on indirect auto lending. The GAO opinions on whether agency actions are subject to the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect. However, the Senate has treated these opinions as decisive in triggering the CRA disapproval process, as seen in the case of a joint resolution passed in May 2018 following a GAO opinion on a 2013 CFPB bulletin. The GAO opinions facilitate congressional review of rules not submitted under the CRA. A provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability. The provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability, meaning that the question of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA will likely be settled in the political arena rather than in the courts. This may also extend to determining when a rule has taken effect, as agencies must submit covered rules to Congress before they become operative. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) sponsors stated that any covered rule not submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General will not take effect until submitted. Courts have been hesitant to enforce this provision, and a GAO opinion may prompt an agency to realize a rule did not take effect due to non-compliance with the CRA. However, for agency rules lacking legal effect, the CRA's determination may not have a significant impact. The CRA requires agencies to submit certain statements, even if they lack legal effect. The term \"effect\" in the CRA's submission requirement may not necessarily mean legal effect. Some courts have ruled that the CRA can suspend a rule's operation, even if it technically became effective. However, for rules like general policy statements that lack legal force, non-compliance with the CRA may have less impact on agency actions. The GAO opinions summarize whether agency actions were rules eligible for disapproval under the CRA. The Emergency Sale Timber Program aimed to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. GAO determined that a memorandum regarding the program was subject to CRA review. The GAO concluded that a memorandum regarding the Salvage Sales Conducted Under Section 2001(b) of P.L. 104-19 was a rule under the CRA. Additionally, the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was also deemed a rule under the CRA. President William Clinton signed Executive Order 13061 related to the American Heritage River. President William Clinton signed Executive Order 13061 on September 11, 1997, to support American communities in restoring and protecting rivers. The order designated 10 rivers for the American Heritage River Initiative. The Environmental Protection Agency issued guidance on investigating Title VI complaints challenging permits, affecting non-agency parties and deemed a rule under the CRA. The Farm Credit Administration issued a booklet on national charters, which was deemed a legislative rule by the GAO. The booklet was found to affect non-agency parties and was not exempt under the CRA. The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) issued in December 2000 outlined actions to restore anadromous fish in the Trinity River. GAO classified the ROD as a \"rule\" under the CRA due to its broad impact on ecosystems and economic effects in the Sacramento and Trinity River basins. Additionally, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum in 2002 regarding marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. The VA issued a memorandum in 2002 directing network directors to stop certain marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. GAO determined that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA as it only governed internal agency procedures and did not affect veterans' ability to enroll. Additionally, in January 2003, the VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program, which allowed the VA to make loans for the sale of foreclosed VA-loan-guaranteed property. The VA Secretary announced the discontinuation of financing for acquired properties. GAO determined that this decision did not fall under the CRA as it pertained to agency management. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and an information memorandum about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program were considered rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) due to their general applicability and future effect. The GAO concluded that an information memorandum on the TANF program was considered a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect. The memorandum established criteria for states to apply for waivers from TANF requirements. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed rule on greenhouse gas emissions from new stationary sources. The GAO concluded that the proposed rule regarding steam generating units and natural gas-fired combustion turbines was not covered by the CRA as it was considered an interim step in the rulemaking process. Additionally, on March 22, 2013, interagency guidance was issued on leveraged lending activities for agency-supervised institutions. The GAO concluded that the leveraged-lending guidance and the amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan were rules under the CRA due to their significant impact on the regulated community. The GAO determined that the amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan was a rule under the CRA because of its substantial impact on the regulated community. The plan issued by the Bureau of Land Management for areas in Alaska was deemed a rule under the CRA as well, as it was of general applicability and designed to implement law or policy. The GAO concluded that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's bulletin on \"Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\" was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability, future effect, and policy-prescribing nature. This opinion was issued on October 19, 2017, without addressing the timing of the bulletin's release in 2013. On January 23, 2017, President Trump established the \"Mexico City Policy\" prohibiting funding to foreign organizations promoting abortion. The Department of State and USAID issued related documents in 2017. GAO determined these actions were not rules under the CRA. The GAO determined that agency actions implementing President Trump's Mexico City Policy were not subject to review under the APA due to the President's broad discretion in foreign affairs. The IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed tax returns without ACA reporting requirements. The GAO concluded that the IRS statement regarding health coverage reporting was not a rule under the CRA, as it only changed the timing of compliance measures. Additionally, the SSA's HALLEX policy on using internet information in disability benefit claims was also not considered a rule under the CRA. The GAO concluded that the SSA's HALLEX policy on using internet information in disability benefit claims was not a rule under the CRA, as it only governs procedures and does not impose new burdens on claimants. The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, modifying reporting requirements for tax-exempt entities, and submitted it to Congress under the CRA for review. Senator Orrin Hatch requested GAO's opinion on whether the revenue procedure qualified as a rule under the CRA. The IRS submitted a revenue procedure to Congress under the CRA for review. GAO opined that the submission triggered the CRA's timelines, but since the rule was already submitted, a GAO opinion on its applicability was unnecessary. The GAO confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA because the IRS had already submitted it. GAO stated that the April 2018 memorandum on illegal border crossings was not a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and did not change individuals' rights or obligations. The GAO concluded that a memorandum issued by the Secretary of Commerce regarding adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census was not a rule under the CRA, as it was considered direction from a supervisor to a subordinate in conjunction with statutory requirements for informing Congress of census questions. The GAO determined that the memorandum from the Secretary of Commerce on adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census did not meet the definition of a \"rule\" under the CRA, as it was considered direction to a subordinate in line with statutory requirements for informing Congress of census questions."
