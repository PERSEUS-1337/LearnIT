    "content": "The Internet is a network of interconnected networks, linking millions of computers worldwide. Each computer has a unique IP number for communication. Domain names provide a simpler way to access websites, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS maps addresses to domain names, maintained by root servers for connectivity. DARPA funded the Internet's origins for military use. The Internet originated with DARPA funding for military use and expanded with support from NSF and other science agencies. Key entities like IANA and NSF played roles in managing the DNS and IP address space. NSF was responsible for nonmilitary domain name registration. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic for domain name registration services, leading to NSI's sole control over .com, .net, and .org domains. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns about IANA's role prompted international actions, including the IAHC's proposal for creating seven new gTLDs in 1997. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs in 1997, recommending additional registrars to compete in granting registration services. The U.S. government, through the NTIA, assessed the proposal and issued the White Paper in 1998, indicating readiness to work with a new not-for-profit corporation for Internet policy administration. The U.S. government endorsed a process for Internet policy administration, leading to the creation of ICANN in 1998. Meetings were held to discuss the structure of the new corporation, which eventually signed an MOU with the Department of Commerce for the transition of DNS functions to the private sector. ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The U.S. government stated principles on the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing security and stability. A new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) was announced in 2006 to continue the transition to the private sector coordination of DNS. On September 29, 2006, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition the coordination of technical functions related to the DNS to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was agreed upon to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, competition, consumer trust, choice, and international participation. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, subject to legal oversight by the California attorney general. ICANN, a nonprofit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, is subject to legal oversight by the California attorney general. Its organizational structure includes a Board of Directors advised by various supporting organizations and advisory committees. The Board, consisting of 16 members, is responsible for making final policy and operational decisions related to the management of the Internet and domain name registration. The explosive growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to marked growth of the ICANN budget, reaching $159 million in revenue and a staff of 373 in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. The Department of Commerce and various congressional committees oversee ICANN's activities and policies. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of the network architecture enabling the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The DOC has no role in ICANN's internal governance or operations. ICANN's DNS coordination was transitioned to a private-sector entity by the Department of Commerce. The U.S. government retains a role in DNS through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA, and VeriSign. An Affirmation of Commitments was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination. Many stakeholders debated whether the Department of Commerce (DOC) should continue overseeing ICANN after the JPA expiration in 2009. U.S. groups argued for DOC control to prevent international influence over DNS, while international entities believed ICANN was ready for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress, stating that ICANN needed more progress in accountability and transparency. The Senate acknowledged ICANN's progress in accountability and transparency but emphasized the need for further improvements. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public feedback on the JPA expiration, highlighting areas for enhancement in ICANN's institutional confidence. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and the model of private-sector leadership represented by ICANN. On June 4, 2009, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA and the need for its extension. Majority members urged for a \"permanent instrument\" between DOC and ICANN to ensure accountability and transparency. This instrument should include periodic reviews of ICANN performance, steps for accountability improvement, mechanisms for new gTLDs and domain names, and measures for timely WHOIS information access. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the need for a permanent instrument between DOC and ICANN to ensure accountability and transparency, including periodic reviews of ICANN performance, steps for accountability improvement, mechanisms for new gTLDs and domain names, and measures for timely WHOIS information access. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) requires ICANN to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices, and establishes review panels to evaluate ICANN governance and transparency. The panel, consisting of key stakeholders including the GAC chair and ICANN CEO, will review ICANN's plan to enhance DNS operational stability. Additionally, the panel will assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and choice. The panel, composed of key stakeholders including the GAC chair and ICANN CEO, will review existing WHOIS policy to ensure effectiveness and meet the needs of law enforcement and consumer trust. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability in various areas. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011, focusing on governance, GAC effectiveness, public input, and review mechanisms. ATRT2 presented 12 new recommendations in December 2013. The IANA functions contract authorizes ICANN to manage DNS technical aspects, including IP address allocation and root zone file editing. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes. The June 30, 2005, U.S. government principles aimed to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly affect this authority. The U.S. government has authority over the DNS root zone file, which was not directly affected by the expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN, with measures in place to increase transparency and accountability. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States. The NTIA has authority over the DNS root zone file and awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet community. NTIA expects ICANN to work collaboratively with stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. In October 2013, various Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA requires any transition proposal to have broad community support and adhere to four principles: support the multistakeholder model, maintain Internet DNS security, meet global customer needs, and preserve Internet openness. Supporters of the transition argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe this will allow the United States to effectively oppose proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. Critics are concerned that NTIA's oversight has been a necessary safeguard for the integrity and stability of the DNS. Critics fear that without NTIA oversight, foreign governments could exert more control over the Internet and DNS, potentially harming US interests. Concerns also arise about the transition plan to a new international governance entity, with worries about censorship-prone governments gaining influence. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342 to prevent NTIA from relinquishing control. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prevent the NTIA from giving up oversight of the Internet domain name system. The bill requires a report from the GAO on the advantages and disadvantages of the change, addressing national security concerns. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved H.R. 4342, and later requested the GAO to examine the Administration's proposal for transitioning NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. The DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent the NTIA from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain name system. The House passed H.R. 4435, with provisions to protect the .mil domain and maintain separation between policymaking and technical operations. The Senate's S. 2410 also addressed the future of the Internet and the .mil top-level domain. The Senate's S. 2410 addressed the future of the Internet and the .mil top-level domain, urging the Department of Defense to ensure the exclusive use of the '.MIL' domain for national security and to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The committee recommended seeking an agreement to maintain the .mil domain's status after the transition to a global multi-stakeholder community. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-235) affirms the .mil domain's continued status as a generic top-level domain, on par with other country-specific domains. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to support the IANA transfer only with assurances for protecting legacy domain names and IP addresses used for national security, maintaining consensus-based decision-making, and ensuring transparent and secure accountability processes. The accountability process of the multi-stakeholder model for the Internet is transparent, secure, and efficient. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. H.R. 4660 FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act does not include funds for the transition to ICANN. The House passed H.R. 4660 in May 2014, prohibiting funds for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility over Internet domain functions. The Senate directed NTIA to review the IANA contract transition to ensure ICANN's oversight plan is independent from foreign control. Quarterly reports on privatization process are required. The committee directed NTIA to report quarterly on the privatization process and inform them in advance of any decisions regarding a successor contract. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility over Internet domain functions during FY2015. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities expires on September 30, 2015. The Explanatory Statement accompanying P.L. 113-235 reiterates House and Senate language regarding ICANN and IANA matters. NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA must submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment of P.L. 113-235 regarding any recourse available to the United States in case of deleterious decisions post-transition. Other legislation addressing the proposed transition includes H.R. 4367 (Internet Stewardship Act of 2014). Legislation introduced in response to the proposed transition includes H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, which aim to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and domain name responsibilities without meeting specific criteria. Hearings and reintroduction of the DOTCOM Act also addressed the issue. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced in the 114th Congress as H.R. 805 by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress examining the implications of the proposed transfer. The report will analyze advantages, disadvantages, transfer proposals, national security concerns, and the multistakeholder model. The NTIA is discussing the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking and governance. In the Senate, S.Res. 71 was introduced to raise awareness about NTIA's proposed transition and the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, and a hearing was held on preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. ICANN is working on a transition proposal for the IANA functions, with a focus on enhancing accountability. A steering group will oversee the process in an open and inclusive manner, involving representatives from various Internet constituencies. After receiving public feedback, ICANN formed a Coordination Group to manage the transition. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN in response to public feedback on the transition proposal. The ICG consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities and is responsible for coordinating the development of a proposal for the transition of the IANA functions. The group has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by the operational communities associated with each function. The Domain Names proposal, developed by the CWG-Stewardship, is still in progress. The CWG-Stewardship is working on an IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal for Naming Related Functions, with a best-case scenario for submission by June 2015. The CRISP Team submitted the final Number Resources proposal to the ICG on January 15, 2015, while the IANAPLAN WG finalized the Protocol Parameters proposal on January 6, 2015. Consensus on a domain name function proposal has been challenging, with a deadline extension to June 2015. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also initiated a process to enhance its accountability in case it is no longer subject to the IANA contract with the U.S. government. This process aims to strengthen ICANN's broader accountability mechanisms to address the potential absence of its historical contractual relationship with the DOC. ICANN is examining how to strengthen its accountability mechanisms in the absence of its historical contract with the DOC. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals for enhancing accountability towards stakeholders. The CCWG consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants. Decisions will be made by consensus, with the group open to interested individuals as participants. Up to seven advisors will provide independent advice and research. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) is focused on enhancing ICANN's accountability mechanisms. It consists of various members, including advisors and liaisons, working on two interrelated Work Streams. Work Stream 1 aims to enhance accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe, while Work Stream 2 addresses topics extending beyond the transition. Any accountability proposal approved by the CCWG will be submitted to the ICANN Board for consideration, with detailed rationale required for any decision not to implement a recommendation. The ICANN Board must provide a detailed rationale for any decision not to implement a recommendation. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, while Workstream 2's proposal will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is necessary for the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015, or to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign before that date. The NTIA will actively monitor discussions within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan, participate in meetings with ICANN and other stakeholders, and provide feedback. They support an open and participatory process but emphasize the importance of getting the transition right on the first attempt. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of considering all transition proposal models and ensuring accountability in new organizational structures replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions contract. Stress testing of proposed solutions by the CCWG-Accountability group is crucial to safeguard against future contingencies and maintain ICANN's integrity. NTIA encourages addressing questions on board member removal, accountability tools improvement, and synchronization of transition processes. The timing for delivering a transition plan is aimed for summer with flexibility to extend if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership influencing policy decisions globally. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership influencing policy decisions globally. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides advice to the ICANN Board on public policy matters. The United Nations has debated greater international involvement in Internet governance. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 calling for further internationalization of Internet governance. The report proposed creating a new global forum for Internet stakeholders and suggested models that could supplant ICANN or make it accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The U.S. opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body, while the EU initially supported the U.S. position but later seemed to shift its support. The EU initially supported the U.S. position on Internet governance, but later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an agreement in 2005, maintaining ICANN and the U.S. roles. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N., providing a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed in 2010 for another five years. The U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) tasked to develop a report on improving the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 regarding new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on government influence on ICANN policy. Different nations had varying opinions on the governance of the Internet, with some advocating for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) on ICANN policy decisions. A group of nations, including Russia and China, proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion at the U.N. General Assembly. The code promotes a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. They released a revised version stating that all states must have equal responsibility for Internet governance to ensure stability and access for all. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai in 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) took place in Dubai in December 2012, convened by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs). The key policy question was how to address Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The Administration and Congress advocated for maintaining a multistakeholder model of Internet governance and preventing the ITU from extending its jurisdiction over the Internet. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT). A resolution, H.Con.Res. 127, was passed unanimously by the House to preserve the multistakeholder governance model and promote a global Internet free from government control. Resolution H.Con.Res. 127 was passed unanimously by the House on August 2, 2012, to promote a global Internet free from government control. A similar resolution, S.Con.Res. 50, was introduced in the Senate and passed by unanimous consent on September 22, 2012. This resolution aimed to preserve the multistakeholder model governing the Internet and oppose extending ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance. The proposal for ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was withdrawn, but a nonbinding resolution (Resolution 3) was adopted by the ITU to promote an enabling environment for Internet growth. This resolution emphasized equal government roles in international Internet governance and invited Member States to discuss related issues at ITU forums. The United States declined to sign the treaty due to Resolution 3 and other new ITR articles on spam and cybersecurity. The United States declined to sign the final ITR text, including Resolution 3 and new articles on spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress monitoring and opposing any proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy of preserving the multistakeholder model governing the Internet, and it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in May 2013. In October 2013, the President of ICANN and other leaders called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation, emphasizing the importance of coherent Internet operations and addressing governance challenges. They also advocated for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions to involve all stakeholders equally. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil the day after the Montevideo Statement was released. The Montevideo Statement called for equal participation of all governments in global Internet governance. Following this, a meeting called NETmundial was held in April 2014 in Brazil, focusing on crafting Internet governance principles. The outcome was a nonbinding statement endorsing the multistakeholder model and the transition of IANA functions to the global community. The multistakeholder model of Internet governance endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's role in IANA functions to the global community, emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, which released a report on principles and frameworks for global Internet cooperation. Additionally, a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in partnership with the World Economic Forum. The World Economic Forum announced the NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea concluded without expanding its role in Internet governance, as feared by the U.S. delegation. The ITU decided not to expand its role in Internet governance or cybersecurity, acknowledging that these issues are outside its mandate. ICANN manages Top Level Domains (TLDs), including country codes and generic TLDs like .com and .org. There are currently 22 gTLDs in operation, with some reserved for specific organizations and others open for registration. Debate has focused on expanding the number of gTLDs to meet the growing demand for domain names. ICANN embarked on a consultative process to introduce new gTLDs into the domain name system. Between 2008 and 2011, ICANN released iterations of the gTLD Applicant Guidebook. In 2011, the ICANN Board approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012 with a fee of $185,000. The program has faced controversy over trademark protection and higher costs. Trademark holders and governments expressed concerns over intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes in the new gTLD space. Despite opposition from some U.S. government entities, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion as planned, defending the program's benefits. ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion as planned, defending the program's benefits. By December 2011, ICANN stated its intention to continue with the gTLD expansion, arguing that it will offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. The application window for new gTLDs opened on January 12, 2012, with 1,930 applications received, including geographic names and Internationalized Domain Names in various scripts. ICANN moved into the evaluation phase to decide on accepting the new gTLD applications. The approval process for a new gTLD can take 9 to 20 months, depending on various factors. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures. Currently, 521 gTLDs are added to the Internet, with 894 in progress. Concerns about domain name abuse arise as new gTLDs go live. ICANN plans for a second round with changes to the application process. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing domain name abuse and intellectual property protection in new gTLDs is a key concern as the program progresses. Legislation has been enacted to create a \"kids-friendly\" top-level domain for age-appropriate content, while there are discussions about establishing an adult content top-level domain for filtered material. A second level domain within the .us TLD (kids.us) is restricted to material suitable for minors. Legislation has been considered to establish an adult content top-level domain that could be filtered by parents. Two bills in past Congresses aimed to compel ICANN to create a mandatory top-level domain for material harmful to minors, but did not advance. ICANN has considered allowing a gTLD for adult content since 2000, and in 2005 announced negotiations with a registry company to operate a new \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, with registration being voluntary. The Department of Commerce requested more time for ICANN to address objections to the proposed .xxx domain for adult websites. Despite initial controversy, negotiations continued with ICM Registry, leading to a proposed revised agreement for the establishment of the .xxx domain in 2007. On January 5, 2007, ICANN published a proposed revised agreement with ICM Registry for a .xxx domain. However, on March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to assume ongoing management of Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry on February 19, 2010. The decision was not binding, and the ICANN Board had to determine whether to approve ICM's application for a .xxx TLD. The ICANN Board of Directors decided to allow ICM's .xxx TLD application to move forward after a series of meetings and consultations. The Board approved next steps for the application, including due diligence, negotiations on a draft registry agreement, and consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. Despite some conflicts with GAC advice, the Board intended to enter into a registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD. The ICANN Board approved the .xxx registry agreement with ICM despite conflicts with GAC advice. The Board granted authority to execute the agreement, leading to the establishment of the .xxx TLD in December 2011. Concerns about DNS vulnerabilities were also highlighted, emphasizing the importance of Internet security. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) mitigate vulnerabilities in the DNS system by digitally signing DNS data to assure validity. \"Signing the root\" is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. Plans were announced to work with ICANN and VeriSign for an interim approach. NTIA filed a notice for public comments on testing and evaluation report for DNSSEC implementation in the root zone. ICANN published the information on July 15, 2010. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor and operators began serving the signed root zone with actual keys on July 15, 2010. DNSSEC deployment requires voluntary adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. The accessibility of WHOIS database information has been a contentious issue, with privacy advocates calling for limitations while businesses, law enforcement, and the U.S. government argue for continued public access to accurate WHOIS information. The debate over the accessibility of WHOIS information continues within ICANN's GNSO, with privacy advocates supporting limited access and various other groups advocating for continued public availability. The GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for displaying WHOIS data, despite opposition from intellectual property interests, business constituencies, and law enforcement agencies. In October 2007, the GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended further studies, rejecting a proposal to allow Internet users to list third-party contact information. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies, rejecting a proposal to list third-party contact information. ICANN initiated four separate studies of WHOIS in 2011, examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and feasibility of a reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS in 2012. In 2014, ICANN approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data and consider safeguards for protecting that data. The CEO is launching a new effort to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data and consider safeguards for protecting it. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is developing next steps for implementing the report. The ownership and registration of domain names have raised intellectual property concerns, leading to the adoption of a dispute resolution policy by ICANN in 1999. ICANN's Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, implemented in 1999, allows for resolution of disputes, especially for \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, gives courts the authority to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith.\" This act also provides for statutory civil damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name identifier. The addition of new generic top-level domain names by ICANN has sparked debate over intellectual property concerns. The addition of new generic top-level domain names by ICANN has sparked debate over intellectual property concerns, with many stakeholders arguing that it could compromise intellectual property rights and increase trademark protection costs. Recent legislative efforts such as the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA aimed to address online piracy by prohibiting Internet service providers from directing traffic to infringing domain names. Decisions regarding the DNS can impact various Internet policy issues like privacy, e-commerce, and cybersecurity, with ICANN's actions affecting stakeholders globally. The key policy question in transferring DNS management to the private sector has always been how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair global representation. The debate over Internet governance revolves around ensuring Internet stability, security, competition, and fair global representation. Governments are seeking increased influence in Internet policy development, while defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for a bottom-up, consensus approach to protect against governmental control. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will monitor the transition plan's development, ensuring a stable, secure, and open DNS free of U.S. government control. Congress will also assess intergovernmental conferences' potential for increased control over the Internet and evaluate NTIA's efforts to counteract this threat. These decisions could significantly impact the evolution of ICANN and the DNS. The State Department is working to counteract threats that could impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
