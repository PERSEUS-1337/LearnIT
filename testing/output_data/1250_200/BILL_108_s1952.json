    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act\". Congress finds that the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US Trade Representative to enforce rights under trade agreements. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act states that section 301 determinations are based on WTO panel findings. A WTO panel report in 2000 confirmed that section 301 is consistent with US obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements. On January 28, 2000, a WTO panel found Mexico's antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the US violated Uruguay Round Agreements. The Dispute Settlement Body adopted the panel's report on February 24, 2000. Despite a deadline for compliance on September 22, 2000, Mexico issued a revised antidumping determination on September 20, 2000, to evade its commitment. Mexico continued to evade its commitment to comply with the WTO panel report on the antidumping order for high fructose corn syrup. Despite multiple rulings affirming Mexico's non-compliance, Mexico imposed a discriminatory 20% tariff on the product on January 1, 2002. Mexico imposed a discriminatory 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, effectively continuing its antidumping order on US high fructose corn syrup by restricting market access. This tax was lifted only after ensuring that US imports would not enter the Mexican market, allowing Mexico to claim compliance with WTO findings. The imposition of a 20 percent tax on high fructose corn syrup by Mexico is linked to the lifting of the antidumping order, denying US trade rights. Import restrictions led to a significant drop in US high fructose corn syrup imports to Mexico. The US has pursued dispute settlement actions against Mexico for these trade practices. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms related to dispute settlement, including the Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement Body, dispute settlement panel, Dispute Settlement Understanding, GATT 1994, and Uruguay Round Agreements. The Act defines key terms related to dispute settlement, including the Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement Body, dispute settlement panel, Dispute Settlement Understanding, GATT 1994, Uruguay Round Agreements, World Trade Organization, and WTO Agreement. SEC. 4. Enforcement of US rights under trade agreements for high fructose corn syrup exports to Mexico. Congress determines that Mexico's imposition of a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup and extension of an unjustified antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the United States violates US rights under trade agreements, burdens US commerce, and denies rights entitled to the US under existing trade agreements with Mexico. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup and preserve US rights under trade agreements. A certification from the USTR must be submitted to Congress within 30 days of the Act's enactment stating Mexico's compliance. If certification is not made, the USTR will consult with relevant committees and take appropriate action within 60 days. The United States Trade Representative, after consulting with relevant committees, may suspend trade agreement concessions with Mexico or impose duties on Mexican goods, including agricultural products, if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup."
