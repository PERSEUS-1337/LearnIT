    "content": "Deep networks aim to understand complex mappings through locally linear behavior. The challenge lies in the instability of derivatives, especially for networks with piecewise linear activation functions. A new learning problem is proposed to promote stable derivatives over larger regions. The algorithm involves identifying stable linear approximation regions and expanding them. This approach is demonstrated on residual and recurrent networks using image and sequence datasets. The derivatives of functions parameterized by deep learning models are unstable, especially in over-parametrized models, leading to unstable function values and derivatives. This instability affects the robustness of first-order approximations used for explanations. Gradient stability is different from adversarial examples, as a stable gradient can be large or small as long as it remains stable. Explanation of gradient stability and its relation to adversarial examples. Robust estimation techniques focus on stable function values rather than stable gradients but can indirectly impact gradient stability.

Sensitivity analysis on derivatives identifies stability bounds at each timestamp and channel. The RNN model with ROLL regularization shows larger stability bounds compared to the vanilla model when trained on the Caltech-256 dataset. Evaluation measures are challenging due to high input dimensionality, so a sample-based approach is used to assess the stability of gradients. The stability of gradients for the RNN model with ROLL regularization on the Caltech-256 dataset is evaluated using a sample-based approach. Gradient distortion is measured in terms of expected and maximum 1 distortion, with optimization required for the latter. The adversarial gradient is found by maximizing distortion over an \u221e-norm ball. The study evaluates the stability of gradients in the RNN model with ROLL regularization on the Caltech-256 dataset. A genetic algorithm is used for black-box optimization due to the complexity of the gradient calculations. Results show that the ROLL loss yields more stable gradients and slightly better precision compared to the vanilla loss. Only a small number of images have their prediction labels changed due to gradient distortion. Visual examples demonstrate the differences in gradient shapes and intensities between the two loss functions.

The proposed ROLL loss expands regions with stable derivatives and generalizes the stable gradient property across linear regions. The activation pattern is equivalent to satisfying linear constraints in the network layers. The proof of directional feasibility states that if a point x, a feasible set S(x), and a unit vector \u2206x exist such that x + \u00af\u2206x is in S(x), then f \u03b8 is linear in {x + \u2206x : 0 \u2264 \u2264\u00af }. Propositions 5 and 6 discuss 1-ball feasibility and 2-ball certificate, respectively, in relation to convex sets and hyperplanes. The proof involves constructing a neural network feasible in Eq. (5) with the same loss as the optimal model in Eq. (4). The network g \u03b8 is built with the same weights and biases as f \u03b8 but with a linear activation function. The procedure collects partial derivatives with respect to an input axis k by feeding a zero vector to g \u03b8. The procedure involves collecting partial derivatives with respect to an input axis k by feeding a zero vector to g \u03b8 to obtain\u1e91 i j (0) and a unit vector e k to obtain\u1e91 i j (e k ). The derivative of each neuron z i j with respect to x k can be computed, allowing for the computation of gradients for all neurons with 2 forward passes. The complexity analysis assumes no overhead for parallel computation, with a total of 2M operations required for computing gradients for a batch of inputs. The procedure involves collecting partial derivatives with respect to an input axis by feeding vectors to obtain gradients. Forward passes with perturbations are used to compute gradients efficiently for all neurons. The dynamic programming approach is efficient for fully connected networks but inefficient for convolutional networks. The dynamic programming approach is efficient for fully connected networks but inefficient for convolutional layers due to the expensive linear transformation. An introductory guide to derivations for maxout/max-pooling nonlinearity is provided, highlighting the feasibility of deriving methods for piecewise linear networks. It is suggested to use convolution with large strides or average-pooling instead of max-pooling to avoid new linear constraints. The activation pattern determines which input is selected, leading to a degeneration to a linear model when fixed. The activation pattern in a neural network can lead to a degeneration to a linear model when fixed. This induces a feasible set in the input space with stable derivatives. The feasible set can be represented as a convex polyhedron with linear constraints, allowing for the application of inference and learning algorithms. The model consists of fully-connected hidden layers with specific dimensions and loss function. Training is done with an optimizer over multiple epochs, with a fixed parameter and increasing constraints for max-pooling neurons. The model is trained for 5000 epochs using the Adam optimizer. The regularization parameters are tuned to 1, and the data is normalized. The fully-connected model has 4 hidden layers with 300 neurons each, using ReLU activation. Training is done with cross-entropy loss and soft-max function. Stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum is used, with a learning rate of 0.01 and batch size of unspecified value. The model is chosen based on the best validation loss from all epochs using stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum. Parameters are tuned through grid search on \u03bb, C, \u03b3.
