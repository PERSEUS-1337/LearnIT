    "content": "The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" allows for a credit for employer expenses for child care assistance under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit is known as the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit. The Employer-Provided Child Care Credit allows for a 50% credit on qualified child care expenditures, with a maximum credit of $150,000 per year. Qualified child care expenditures include expenses for property used as a child care facility, not part of the taxpayer's or any employee's principal residence. The Employer-Provided Child Care Credit covers expenses for a qualified child care facility, including operating costs, training, scholarship programs, and increased compensation for employees. The facility must primarily provide dependent care assistance to qualify for the credit. A qualified child care facility must primarily provide dependent care assistance and meet all state or local regulations, including licensing. The facility must be open to the taxpayer's employees and not be their primary business to qualify for the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit. The Employer-Provided Child Care Credit requires that a qualified child care facility must meet state regulations, be open to the taxpayer's employees, and not be their primary business. If there is a recapture event with respect to the facility, the taxpayer's tax will be increased by a certain percentage of the decrease in credits allowed. The Employer-Provided Child Care Credit requires a qualified child care facility meeting state regulations, open to employees, and not their primary business. In case of a recapture event, the taxpayer's tax increases by a percentage of the decrease in credits allowed based on a specific formula. The recapture event in the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit results in a percentage reduction in credits allowed based on a specific formula over different years, starting at 100% in Years 1-3 and decreasing to 0% in Years 11 and thereafter. The recapture event is defined as a specific event triggering the reduction in credits. The recapture event in the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit is defined as the cessation of operation or change in ownership of a qualified child care facility, leading to a reduction in credits allowed over time. The tax liability of the person disposing of an interest in a facility is immediately transferred to the person acquiring the interest. Any recapture liability is assessed as if there had been no change in ownership. Special rules apply, such as adjusting carryforwards and carrybacks for unused tax credits. Under this subsection, the tax increase does not apply if a qualified child care facility ceases operation due to a casualty loss that is restored within a reasonable period. Special rules apply for aggregation of employers, pass-thru in estates and trusts, and allocation in partnerships. The rules of subsection (d) of section 52 apply to the allocation of the credit among partners in partnerships. No double benefit is allowed, with the basis of property being reduced by the amount of the credit determined under this section. If there is a recapture amount, the basis of the property is increased by that amount. The recapture amount refers to any increase in tax determined under subsection (d). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit determined under this section. This section does not apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1999. Conforming amendments are made to section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D is amended in the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments to the employer-provided child care credit under section 45D will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
