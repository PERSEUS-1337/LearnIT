    "content": "The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1993, also known as the Rent-To-Own Protection Act, amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act by adding a new title specifically for rent-to-own transactions. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act includes provisions such as definitions, application of laws, disclosures on goods, prohibitions, civil liability, and regulations. It aims to address issues in the rent-to-own industry targeting low-income neighborhoods, lack of disclosure in contracts, and unfair debt collection practices. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act aims to provide consumers with protections similar to retail installment sales, require disclosure of material terms in rent-to-own contracts, and prohibit abusive collection practices by dealers and agents. Key definitions such as 'cash price' are outlined in the Act. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act defines terms such as 'Commission' and 'consumer' for personal, family, or household purposes. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act defines 'credit' as the right to possess consumer goods under a rent-to-own contract before full payment, with the credit amount calculated as the difference between total payments and the cash price plus allowable fees. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act defines terms such as 'organization' as a business entity and 'person' as an individual or organization. It also outlines a rent-to-own contract as a lease allowing possession and use of consumer goods with an option to renew and transfer ownership. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act defines terms such as 'seller' as a person who regularly offers consumer goods under rent-to-own contracts. It also clarifies that a rent-to-own transaction involves leasing or bailing consumer goods under a specific contract. Additionally, the Act specifies that State laws regarding fees, charges, guarantees, and warranties apply to sellers in rent-to-own transactions. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act prohibits sellers in rent-to-own transactions from charging excessive interest, fees, or finance charges beyond what is allowed by State laws. This includes limitations on interest rates, fees, and credit insurance premiums. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act allows sellers in rent-to-own transactions to charge termination fees and fees for recovery of items not returned voluntarily. Termination fees are capped at 5% of the cash price disclosed in the contract. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act allows for termination fees and recovery fees to be disclosed in the contract. Termination of a contract by a consumer with a termination fee satisfies obligations for payments and fees, except those due prior to termination. Guarantees and warranties for goods sold in consumer credit sales must comply with state laws. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act ensures that state laws for goods sold in consumer credit sales also apply to goods in rent-to-own transactions. Federal laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act also apply to rent-to-own transactions. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act requires sellers to disclose key information on goods available for rent-to-own transactions, including cash price, services offered, annual percentage rate, and payment details. The Fair Credit Reporting Act also applies to these transactions. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act mandates sellers to disclose payment details, total payments required for ownership, and whether the item is new or used. Prohibitions under the Act include threats of criminal prosecution, coercion for collection, and conduct that oppresses or harasses consumers. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act prohibits oppressive, harassing, or abusive conduct in debt collection, unreasonable disclosure of consumer information, fraudulent representations, unconscionable collection methods, unfair or deceptive practices in rent-to-own contracts, and misleading advertising of free services that incur charges. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act prohibits deceptive practices in rent-to-own contracts and empowers the Commission to enforce compliance with the Act. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act empowers the Commission to enforce compliance with the Act by treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts in commerce. Sellers failing to disclose terms properly may be liable to consumers for damages, $500 per failure, and legal fees. Violations of the Act result in liability to consumers for damages and legal fees. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act allows consumers to seek damages, $5,000 per violation, and legal fees for non-compliance. Actions can be brought within 2 years of the violation in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Rent-To-Own Consumer Credit Protection Act allows consumers to seek damages of $5,000 per violation and legal fees for non-compliance within 2 years. Regulations must be issued within 6 months of enactment, and state laws still apply unless inconsistent with this title. The Federal Trade Commission must provide Congress with recommendations for further action on regulating rent-to-own transactions within 2 years of this Act. The provisions and amendments of this Act will take effect upon enactment."
