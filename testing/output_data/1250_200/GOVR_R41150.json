    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama. Appropriations totaled $33.5 billion in P.L. 111-85, with additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. The House and Senate proposed bills with funding ranging from $34.7 billion to $35.0 billion, but a continuing resolution was passed on September 30 (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) to fund government programs. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) on September 30, funding government programs at the FY2010 level until December 3. Funding was later extended through March 4, 2011, and then again through March 18, 2011. H.R. 1 was introduced on February 14, 2011, to continue funding for the rest of FY2011 at the FY2010 level with specified exceptions. The House passed H.R. 1 on February 19, but the Senate rejected it on March 9. The Energy and Water Development funding bill, H.R. 1473, was passed on April 14, 2011, with a budget of approximately $32.2 billion. It includes funding for various programs such as civil works projects, the Department of Energy, and independent agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Tables provide budget details for different titles within the bill. The budget details for Title I (Corps of Engineers), Title II (Department of the Interior), Title III (Department of Energy), and Title IV (independent agencies) for FY2010-FY2011 are provided in tables 4 through 15. The FY2011 President's request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $4.88 billion, $564 million below the appropriated level for FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion, while the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development provided $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution, H.R. 1, would have reduced overall funding. Proposed funding for the Corps under the House-passed Continuing Resolution, H.R. 1, would reduce overall funding to approximately $4.8 billion, $641 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's requested level but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with 85% directed to specific projects. Funding debates often involve earmarks and are typically authorized in a Water Resources Development Act. The backlog of authorized projects for the Corps' Civil Works program raises policy questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations, including funds for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. For example, in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, the agency received $5.76 billion in FY2009 funds for Louisiana hurricane protection. The Corps received significant funding for hurricane protection in the Gulf Coast region, including $797 million in 2009 for flood control and coastal emergencies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also provided $4.6 billion for construction projects. The FY2011 budget request included $1.69 billion for construction, with a focus on limiting new starts. The FY2011 budget request included $1.69 billion for construction, with a focus on limiting new starts. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $1.9 billion for the Construction account, using unobligated balances for ongoing activities. The House subcommittee bill proposed $1.851 billion for Construction. P.L. 112-10 allocated $1.78 billion for construction, with a provision barring new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a deficit due to outlays exceeding collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit as expenses for construction and rehabilitation have surpassed incoming collections. The fund is supported by a fuel tax on commercial vessels and federal funding. Previous proposals to increase revenue, such as a lock user fee, have faced criticism. The FY2011 Budget did not assume additional revenue. The Administration's FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, which was supported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Concerns about funding levels for Corps activities in the Everglades and progress in restoration efforts are discussed in CRS Report RS22048. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing the amount to $155 million due to delays and funding issues. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. In FY2011, Congress stopped applying a savings and slippage rate for Corps accounts to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for various Corps accounts, while the Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation was $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The discretionary authority was $1.015 billion with an additional $167 million from other funds, making a total of $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, with the enacted bill including $1.129 billion. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, covers various programs and projects. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, with amendments that could impact dam removal studies and funding for biological opinions related to projects in California. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. They oversee projects in 17 states, serving 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is a major water supplier and hydroelectric power producer, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. The Bureau of Reclamation is the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation, providing flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. However, their operations are controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency has been criticized for not exerting leadership in water supply management and maintaining infrastructure. The Central Valley Project in California is one of their largest projects, but water deliveries have been limited due to drought and environmental restrictions. Recently, Reclamation has had to limit water deliveries and pumping from CVP facilities due to drought and other factors, including environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have seen amendments attempting to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on the effect of project operations on certain fish species. Two BiOps have found that continued operation of the projects under a plan developed in 2004 would jeopardize the existence of Delta Smelt and salmon species in California, protected under the federal and California Endangered Species Acts. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt have led to limits on pumping, impacting fish species listed as threatened or endangered. Other factors like invasive species and pollution also contribute to fishery declines. Low water deliveries exacerbate unemployment in water districts with junior rights. Proposed FY2010 amendments were not enacted, but a bill allowed for water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, a significant increase over FY2010. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for FY2011, a significant increase from the previous year. The fund, authorized by P.L. 111-11, is to be used for fisheries restoration and water management as part of a settlement agreement. Planned actions for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning and design for channel improvements. Additional authorization would be needed for allocations exceeding $88 million. The Friant Dam construction in the 1940s blocked salmon migration in the San Joaquin River. The settlement aims to restore the salmon run and minimize water supply impacts. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated an extra $8 million for river restoration. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) prohibits funding for the settlement in FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program for FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program for FY2011, which focuses on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with a proposed increase of $27.4 million over FY2010 levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding for the program, allocating $20 million for WaterSMART/Challenge Grants, $4 million for Basin Studies, and $7.7 million for Title XVI projects. P.L. 112-10 did not specify programmatic funding levels for WaterSMART. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with some ARRA funds remaining unexpended. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for FY2011, while the House-passed H.R. 1 Continuing Resolution would have funded programs at $24.6 billion. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs in FY2011, but the final legislation appropriated $26.3 billion. EERE funding saw a decrease in P.L. 112-10, while EDER programs also experienced cuts. The DOE requested additional funding for EDER programs, but the final allocation was lower. The DOE requested $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to build a skilled clean energy workforce. The program aims to educate Americans for green jobs, increase U.S. competitiveness, and develop leading edge programs at universities and community colleges. The DOE requested $50 million for the RE-ENERGYSE program to develop a skilled clean energy workforce through fellowships, internships, and education initiatives from K-12 to post-doctoral levels. The DOE proposed a $115 million RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010, but Congress did not fund it. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs and assess program effectiveness. The committee expressed concerns about program duplication and wanted further dialogue with the Department of Energy. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal and no funding was provided in the conference report. For FY2011, the Senate Committee on Appropriations again recommended zero funding. The Solar Program would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million in the FY2011 request, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram for a demonstration project. This project aims to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. Water issues are a potential barrier to CSP development. The Bureau of Land Management is seeing intense competition for CSP development permits due to a huge CSP resource potential. Water issues could pose a serious barrier to CSP development. The PV R&D Program received an increase of $23.5 million for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to accelerate technology cost reduction. The Senate Committee recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project. The Wind Program received a net increase of $42.5 million, with $49.0 million allocated for offshore wind development to address various barriers. DOE anticipates accelerating market deployment of over three gigawatts of offshore projects. This is the first major wind demonstration proposed by DOE since the early 1980s. The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing a major wind demonstration project with over three gigawatts of offshore projects. The Geothermal Program would see an increase of $11.0 million, focusing on collaborative R&D and low-temperature geothermal systems. The Vehicle Technologies Program is also set to receive funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including $13.9 million for the Vehicle Technologies Program and $8.7 million for the Building Technologies Program. The Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub would receive a modest increase to $24.3 million. The omnibus climate/energy bills would authorize DOE to establish more hubs. The Senate Committee recommended $8.7 million less than the request for the Buildings Program, with a lower amount for the Building Design Hub. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including the Building Design Hub receiving $16.0 million less than requested. The committee directed GAO to assess the need for new program guidelines due to reported issues with the ENERGY STAR program. The Industrial Technologies Program would see a net increase of $4.0 million, with a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram funded at $10.0 million. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would increase by $10.3 million to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including projects related to commissioning efforts, fugitive emissions capture hardware, and pilot projects for solar, biomass, and alternative fueling stations. The committee directed DOE to address problems identified in a recent Inspector General report and recommended a $90.0 million increase for the Weatherization Program to support weatherization of an additional 13,200 households. The State Energy Program would have increased by $25.0 million to expand current activities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including a $38.5 million increase for the Facilities Program to complete the Energy Systems Integration Facility at NREL. Program Direction would have increased by $60.0 million for federal workforce ramp-up, and Program Support would have received a $42.3 million increase. The DOE expects a doubling of transactions from FY2009 to FY2011. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million going to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis subprogram. This increase would focus on policy analysis for EE and RE technologies as solutions to climate change. Another $15.0 million would expand support for the International subprogram, addressing energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships. The increase in Program Support funding would be used to expand support for the International subprogram, focusing on partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil for R&D, market transformation, and clean energy potential assessments. New initiatives would include global technology deployment and climate change mitigation efforts, such as the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. The funding would also support regional partnerships like APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and regional energy platforms for Africa, as well as bilateral partnerships with countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina to advance EE and RE technology worldwide. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended cuts to various programs within the DOE, including a $37.0 million reduction in the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program and a $16.9 million cut in the Market Transformation subprogram. Additionally, the Water Power Program would see a $9.5 million decrease. Despite these cuts, the Committee recommended restoring funding to FY2010 levels for DOE's proposed cuts. The DOE's Water Power Program utilizes various renewable energy resources to generate electricity, focusing on technology development and market acceleration. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended cuts to various DOE programs, including a reduction in funding for specific industry subprograms. The Committee also recommended restoring funding to FY2010 levels for proposed cuts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future program, with a decrease in funding compared to FY2010 but an increase from the request. The FY2011 budget would allocate $185.9 million to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, with a focus on energy storage research to address power infrastructure challenges and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, research would target lithium-based batteries for stationary applications. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for various energy research programs, including new electrolytes, power conditioning systems, and integration issues to reduce costs. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research totaled $824.1 million, with P.L. 112-10 providing $732.1 million for the programs. Additionally, $88.2 million was requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The FY2011 budget justification for DOE's nuclear energy R&D program includes generation, safety, waste storage, and security technologies. Critics argue that the program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The Obama Administration has reorganized the budget request, ending funding for the Nuclear Power 2010 Program and establishing new priorities like the Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration Program. Fuel Cycle Research and Development funding was increased by 47.8% to $201 million. The FY2011 budget request for DOE's nuclear energy R&D program includes increased funding for Fuel Cycle Research and Development by 47.8% to $201 million. A new program area called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) is proposed with a funding of $99.3 million, focusing on advanced nuclear power concepts and modeling. Generation IV Research and Development is split between NEET and Reactor Concepts RD&D. Funding for university nuclear education and research remains at $5 million under the RE-ENERGYSE initiative. Additionally, $3 million is allocated for International Nuclear Energy Cooperation. The FY2011 budget request for DOE's nuclear energy R&D program includes $195 million for Reactor Concepts RD&D, which covers the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. The NGNP project aims to produce high-temperature heat for electricity generation and other industrial processes. The budget also includes $3 million for International Nuclear Energy Cooperation. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2010 did not mention the NGNP project specifically, but Congress allocated $169 million for it. The FY2011 budget request included $103 million for NGNP, focusing on high-temperature fuel development, process heat applications, and materials testing. DOE is expected to decide on final design and construction by the end of FY2011. The Advanced Reactor Concepts program, with a funding request of $21.9 million, aims to improve reactor performance in sustainability, safety, economics, security, and proliferation resistance. The budget justification for nuclear technology development includes fast reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs) to enhance sustainability and reduce costs. The DOE plans to award financial assistance for up to two SMR designs and conduct research on extending the life of light water reactors. The DOE's new Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program aims to extend the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. Research will focus on aging reactor materials, safety margins, and improving plant efficiency. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. Total FY2011 funding request for this program was $201 million, with a focus on improving fuel reprocessing technology. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) focused on developing spent fuel reprocessing technology to recycle plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials into new nuclear fuel. Under the Obama Administration, the program aims to explore a wider range of nuclear fuel cycle approaches, including direct disposal of spent fuel and recycling options. Research will also focus on storage, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste. This program aligns with efforts to find alternatives to the Yucca Mountain repository for spent fuel. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program supports the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, researching waste treatment technologies and geologic disposal media. The NEET program conducts research on nuclear energy technology issues, including reactor materials, fuel cycle risks, manufacturing methods, and sensors. The Energy Innovation Hub focuses on modeling and simulation in the nuclear energy sector. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation, previously part of the Generation IV program, is now under NEET with increased funding of $24.3 million. The hub aims to create a computer model of an operating reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011, a 12.7% decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to propose a new budget structure for the FY2012 Coal subprogram to focus more on carbon. The DOE plans to propose a new budget structure for the FY2012 Coal subprogram, focusing on carbon capture and storage technologies. The FutureGen project has been abandoned in favor of refitting an existing plant to capture CO2 emissions, with funding going to the Futuregen Alliance, Ameren Energy Resources, Babcock & Wilcox, and Air Liquide Process & Construction. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities remaining, with no further funding requested in FY2011. The Clean Coal Technology program in Meredosia, IL is in its final project-closeout phase with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget to $725.95 million, including funding for Fuels and Power Systems, Natural Gas Technologies, and a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The committee also supports research projects for high-quality fuels from coal/biomass feedstocks with higher carbon emissions than conventional fuels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established in 1975, consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas to provide emergency crude oil in times of supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was filled to its capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, instead acquiring oil through royalty-in-kind (RIK) and other methods. Legislation in 2008 ordered the suspension of RIK fill for the remainder of the year. In 2008, legislation ordered the suspension of RIK fill for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, due to a decline in oil prices, fill of the SPR resumed in 2009. The Bush Administration announced plans to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. RIK fill resumed in May 2009, bringing the SPR to capacity. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program in 2009, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels. The Administration proposed to suspend spending on SPR expansion in FY2011, redirecting funds to non-expansion operations. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The FY2011 request for the SPR was reduced to $138.9 million from $243.8 million in FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the same amount proposed for FY2011. The Administration proposed suspending spending on Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) expansion in FY2011, redirecting funds to non-expansion operations. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the same amount proposed for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR in FY2011. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and requested $5.121 billion for FY2011, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. In the 112th Congress, funding recommendations for the Office of Science varied between the House and Senate, with amounts ranging from $4.018 billion to $5.012 billion. The final appropriation in P.L. 112-10 was $4,857.7 billion, lower than the requested amount. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aimed to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and other agencies over a decade, but the 4.4% increase requested for FY2011 fell short of the 7.2% annual rate needed for doubling in 10 years. Funding for basic energy sciences saw an increase to $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from the previous year. The requested funding for the largest Office of Science program, basic energy sciences, was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from the previous year. Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) would have increased by $40 million, with a new energy innovation hub on materials for batteries and energy storage receiving $34 million. The existing hub on fuels from sunlight would have received $24 million. The Administration proposed to initiate a total of eight energy innovation hubs in FY2010, but Congress funded only three. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various science programs. This included $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences, two-thirds of the requested funding for energy innovation hubs, $829 million for high-energy physics with proposed increases for specific projects, and $627 million for biological and environmental research with proposed increases for climate modeling and genomic science. The Committee also expressed support for design work on Fermilab construction projects but requested a report on their expected benefits and funding needs. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $614 million for various science programs, including $16 million for climate and Earth system modeling and $11 million for genomic science. The funding for biological and environmental research was limited to $302 million, while nuclear physics received $562 million with $36 million allocated for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility upgrade. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various science programs. The request for advanced scientific computing research was $426 million, with an increase for leadership computing facilities offset by a decrease for research prototypes. Fusion energy sciences funding decreased to $380 million, with a drop in U.S. contribution to ITER due to construction delays. The ITER project in France faced delays causing a drop in funding from $135 million in FY2010 to $80 million in FY2011. The partners include China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US, with a total project cost estimated at $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The expected start-up date was pushed to November 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences in the 111th Congress, expressing concerns about ITER's cost and schedule. ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, received its first funding in FY2009. ARPA-E, funded in FY2009, aims to overcome technological barriers in energy development. The FY2011 budget requested $300 million, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. The Obama Administration proposed terminating the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, including the Yucca Mountain repository project. No funding was allocated for Yucca Mountain due to the administration's decision that it is not a viable solution for nuclear waste disposal. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal, leading to no funding being requested for the project. The NRC rejected the DOE's motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, with the full commission now considering the withdrawal. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to evaluate alternatives to Yucca Mountain, with $5 million provided by Congress for the Commission's work. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has taken over waste management activities from OCRWM, with substantial funding requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. Utilities have won court cases against DOE for failing to meet waste removal deadlines, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion by 2020. The DOE's liability payments could reach $11 billion by 2020 if waste removal from reactor sites does not begin. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects with new technologies. The program requires upfront payment of estimated future government costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure (P.L. 111-8) provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced in 2010 for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. The conditional guarantee agreement in Georgia would provide $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors, contingent on receiving an NRC license. Critics argue that tripling nuclear loan guarantees would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewables and transmission projects, with $6 billion allocated for subsidy costs. However, $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6 billion for subsidy costs for a loan guarantee program for renewables and transmission projects. $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, and $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama requested an additional $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion, with a total ceiling of about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. Remaining appropriations for subsidy cost payments under the Section 1705 loan guarantee program are set to expire at the end of FY2011, but P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. Additionally, P.L. 112-10 authorizes up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects, available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The DOE established the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The program provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to invest in plant capacity for producing fuel-efficient vehicles. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain nuclear weapons expertise. The Stockpile Stewardship Program ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons competencies and the safety of the stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and funded through the Weapons Activities account. The program aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the NNSA, aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The program includes managing the nuclear weapons complex and ensuring any changes to the stockpile align with program objectives. The NNSA manages and sets policy for the nuclear weapons complex, which consists of eight sites. Despite Cold War reductions, there have been calls for further changes to the Complex for increased efficiency, security, and cost reduction. In response, NNSA submitted a plan called \"Complex 2030\" in 2007, which was met with some criticism from Congress. The House Appropriations Committee demanded a comprehensive strategy, detailed stockpile description, and long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the lack of a sensible strategy for efficiency and consolidation in the NNSA's plan for Complex 2030. They rejected the premature deployment of the consolidation effort and called for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA later announced a new plan called Complex Transformation, which aimed to reduce the weapons program footprint and close or transfer structures involved in weapons activities. The Complex Transformation plan aimed to reduce the weapons program footprint, close or transfer structures involved in weapons activities, dismantle weapons more rapidly, and build new facilities. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy before considering funding for new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. The committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and several other programs in order to focus on a 21st Century nuclear deterrent strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended cutting RRW funds in its FY2009 report. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided no RRW funds, and subsequent budgets did not request funding for RRW due to the Administration's commitment to move towards a nuclear-free world. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, vs. FY2010 appropriations of $6,384.4 million. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs are outlined for FY2011 to FY2016. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7.0 billion, with projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs increasing over the period FY2010-FY2020 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. The House proposed a reduction in funding, which was contentious, but a compromise was reached with Senate Republicans to support the New START treaty. The Administration's rationale and budget plan for the increase in funding were outlined in a document from November 2010. The President's FY2012 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,629.7 million, with concerns about funding for FY2011. The program involves work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Specific items include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for warheads like B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and W76 warhead for Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. The Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile are ongoing. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The Stockpile Systems program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, and ongoing assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2010 appropriation was $357.8 million, and the FY2011 request was $649.4 million, with significant increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. The FY2011 budget request includes increases for the W78 warhead, W87 warhead, and B61 phase 6.2/6.2A study. The latter aims to extend the life of nuclear components and enhance safety features for compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. The FY2011 budget request includes increases for the W78 warhead, W87 warhead, and B61 phase 6.2/6.2A study to extend the life of nuclear components. Concerns were raised about surveillance shortfalls jeopardizing the assessment of nuclear weapons safety and reliability. The House bill recommended no funds for the controversial B61-12 variant, while the Senate bill included the requested amount. The conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, including $32.5 million for a study on nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. The bill authorizes reallocating $15,000,000 for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study, with no funds to be used for nuclear components without approval. Two reports on the B61-12 are required, with the Senate recommending the requested amount for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011 and directed NNSA to submit reports on safety and security features for a refurbished B61. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition involves reducing the stockpile, dismantling warheads, and disposing of components. The FY2011 request for WDD is $58.0 million, reflecting a decrease from the previous year. The FY2011 request for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) is $58.0 million, a decrease from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, with $27.5 million allocated to restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Components of WDD have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories. The major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which converts plutonium pits to oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility. The FY2011 request for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) is $58.0 million, a decrease from the previous year. The major activities include converting plutonium pits to oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility. Stockpile Services provide the foundation for production capability within the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $828.8 million, with a $941.5 million request for FY2011. The largest increase was for Plutonium Sustainment, aimed at maintaining technical skills and restoring the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $30.5 million and allocating specific amounts for surveillance, plutonium sustainment, and weapons assembly/disassembly/dismantlement at Pantex. These efforts provide specialized support for nuclear weapons stockpile work. The Science Campaign provides scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. It aims to improve warhead performance assessment, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure. The FY2011 request for this campaign is $365.2 million, with a focus on Advanced Certification to enhance the weapons certification process. The Advanced Certification program in the campaign aims to improve weapons certification processes, refine computational tools, and study failure modes. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the funding request by $10.9 million, with allocations to the Z facility at Sandia and experiments on plutonium. The Z facility in Albuquerque is crucial for studying material reactions under extreme conditions. The Engineering Campaign aims to enhance the safety, reliability, and performance of nuclear weapons without underground testing. The FY2010 appropriation was $150.0 million, with a $141.9 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $8.0 million to simulate a nuclear environment. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign focuses on creating high temperatures and pressures for weapons research. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses high energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models for nuclear weapons without testing. NIF, the world's largest laser, successfully heated a target to 6 million degrees in 2010, marking a significant scientific achievement. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) successfully fired 192 laser beams at a helium-filled target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. This marked a significant advance in the facility's work. The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million, with a $481.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and supported creating an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign aims to develop computational models for nuclear weapons testing. Some analysts question the reliability of simulation and advocate for a return to testing. The campaign for certification of warhead safety, security, and reliability includes funds for hardware, operations, and software. The FY2010 appropriation was $567.6 million, with a $615.7 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety, efficiency, and cost reduction. The FY2010 current appropriation is $100.0 million, with a $112.1 million request for FY2011. Stockpile Readiness, a subprogram within the campaign, sees a significant increase in funding for future manufacturing capabilities. The Tritium Readiness program at the Savannah River Site is facing a decrease in funding due to the cyclical nature of fixed-price contracting. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million, expressing concerns about technical challenges in tritium production. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with a FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. The FY2011 request for the Tritium Readiness program at the Savannah River Site is facing a funding decrease from $50.2 million to $30.2 million due to fixed-price contracting cycles. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the funding and expressed concerns about technical challenges in tritium production. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with a total FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. The committee expressed concern about insufficient funds for Pantex and Y-12, stating that increased funding would prevent layoffs and schedule disruptions. They restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and questioned NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility at the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement at Los Alamos, which would replace the aging CMR building housing plutonium research and pit production. The House Appropriations Committee warned that proceeding with the CMRR project could hinder nuclear complex transformation plans. The CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks a clear mission and may hinder nuclear complex transformation plans. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the CMRR facility and another facility due to uncertainties in stockpile requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about worker safety and containment precautions in the existing CMR facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR project to address funding shortfalls and operational restrictions. Some argue that modifying another building at Los Alamos could fulfill the CMRR's purpose, while others believe the capacity is excessive. Additionally, the Secure Transportation Asset program ensures safe transport of nuclear materials with a requested amount of $248.0 million for FY2011. The FY2010 appropriation for Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response was $221.9 million, with a requested amount of $233.1 million for FY2011. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) focused on eliminating deferred maintenance, with a FY2010 appropriation of $93.9 million and a requested amount of $94.0 million for FY2011. Site Stewardship aimed to ensure environmental compliance and operational efficiency, with a FY2010 request of $90.4 million. The FY2010 request for the Site Stewardship program was $90.4 million, aimed at ensuring environmental compliance and operational efficiency in the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2010 appropriation was $61.3 million, with reductions made by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Senate recommended reducing the FY2011 request of $105.5 million by $5.0 million for the program. Defense Nuclear Security, which includes protective forces and security systems, had a FY2010 appropriation of $769.0 million, with a request of $720.0 million for FY2011. The reduction in funding was attributed to efficiencies achieved through risk-informed decisions and common procurement practices. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 for Defense Nuclear Security operations and maintenance, with a reduction of $9.0 million for construction. Cyber Security funding was recommended at $124.3 million. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs support U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear weapons spread. The National Nuclear Security Administration's nonproliferation and national security programs received increased funding in FY2010, totaling $2.137 billion. This included funding for construction projects like the Mixed-Oxide plant and the Waste Solidification Building. The Obama Administration requested further funding in FY2011 for projects like the Pit Disassembly plant. Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $317.3 million in FY2010 and a request of $351.6 million for FY2011. International security programs, including international safeguards and export controls, were funded at $155.9 million in FY2011. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting received $572.1 million for reducing the threat posed by unsecured Russian weapons and materials. The Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program received $572.1 million in FY2010 and $590.1 million in FY2011 to reduce the threat of unsecured Russian weapons. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production aims to persuade Russia to shut down reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008 and replaced with a fossil-fueled facility. The Fissile Materials Disposition program focuses on disposing of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for this program has been controversial due to lack of progress. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The program would rely on Russian fast reactors under nonproliferation restrictions. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors to use less enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials. Funding requests for these programs were $701.9 million in FY2010 and $1,030.7 million in FY2011. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. This includes disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, and decontaminating facilities. Cleanup is ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the US, with some expected to continue for several decades. DOE expects cleanup to continue at larger, more complex facilities for years, even decades, with outstanding costs estimated between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating and maintaining cleanup remedies and monitoring contaminant levels. Some facilities have been transferred to other DOE offices and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Office of Environmental Management has transferred some facilities to other DOE offices and the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the cleanup of smaller, less contaminated sites under FUSRAP to the Corps, funded within their civil works budget. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for two years before transferring jurisdiction back to DOE. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring at FUSRAP sites and other cleaned-up facilities. Funding for these offices is discussed in three appropriations accounts. The Office of Environmental Management is funded through three appropriations accounts, including Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. In FY2011, a total of $5.69 billion was allocated for the office, which was a decrease from the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. Additionally, $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years were rescinded. The Office of Environmental Management faces challenges in cleanup at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. These facilities have complex cleanup needs and account for over half of the office's funding. Cleanup is expected to continue for decades. The Office of Environmental Management faces challenges in cleanup at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. Cleanup at these facilities is expected to continue for decades due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored there. The lack of availability of a geologic repository and delays in waste treatment facilities construction raise concerns about environmental risks. The Hanford site's waste treatment facilities pose environmental risks from potential untreated waste releases into groundwater discharging into the Columbia River. DOE monitors water quality in the river for contaminants. Funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge is supported by the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established to finance cleanup of sites supporting enrichment facilities. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments to the Fund. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued funding through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established for cleanup of enrichment facilities, faces funding challenges. The fund balance is insufficient for future cleanup costs, estimated at $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over 10 years. Congress needs to enact reauthorizing legislation for the federal government to resume collection of assessments. The federal government needs reauthorizing legislation from Congress to resume collecting nuclear utility assessments. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted for this purpose. The President requested $730.5 million for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million from nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations for FY2011, a decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million, noting the lack of enacted legislation for the assessments. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for nuclear utility assessments, highlighting the lack of reauthorization legislation. P.L. 112-10 included $33.6 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, much less than the President's request of $496.7 million. The federal payment is made through a transfer of funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The committee aimed to fulfill the required federal contribution to the fund as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorizes federal funds for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. DOE is required to pay cleanup costs even if the fund is depleted, potentially needing additional federal funds in the future. Responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. Funding for this office is within the Other Defense Activities Account, with $788.4 million allocated in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011, the same as the President requested but slightly less than the $189.8 million appropriation enacted for FY2010. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to rise over time as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams operated by federal agencies for various purposes. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power to \"preference customers\" at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million from FY2010. Receipts from PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary funding, with SWPA and WAPA requiring additional discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs in FY2011. In FY2011, SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with collections of $23 million from Colorado River basins offsetting discretionary appropriations. BPA is self-funded and receives no appropriations, but has borrowing authority increased to $7.7 billion. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures for operating expenses, Projects Funded in Advance, capital investments, and capital transfers. The budget for FY2011 includes expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402. WAPA now has borrowing authority from the United States Treasury up to $3.25 billion for new transmission lines. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include NRC, ARC, and the Denali Commission. The Energy and Water Development bill funding includes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, with major activities focusing on safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The budget provided $1.052.3 billion, including $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007 due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC has received applications for licenses for 30 reactors since September 2007, with some projects suspended. The proposed FY2011 budget includes funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The budget also covers costs for reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. The NRC's FY2011 budget includes increased spending on homeland security by $3.8 million, totaling $26.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. The FY2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
