Congress finds that many students lack academic preparation in secondary school, leading to limited job prospects, high college dropout rates, and the need for remediation. There is a consensus on the importance of raising academic standards and modeling them after advanced placement programs, which are endorsed by many education leaders and half of all States. Advanced placement courses offer 30 college-level courses, are present in 60% of secondary schools, and serve over 1,000,000 students, with test scores accepted for college credit at over 3,000 colleges.

The Act aims to encourage more students to take advanced placement exams, highlighting the benefits such as acquiring important skills, higher SAT scores, and better grades in school and college.
