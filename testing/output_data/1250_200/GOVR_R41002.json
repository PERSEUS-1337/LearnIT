Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict among Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, affecting benefits and stakeholders. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a key role according to the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government supports water supply development primarily for flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose projects. Major projects were carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s. Since the 1960s, construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and the availability of appropriate sites. Reservoir planning now focuses on balancing objectives in operating existing reservoirs rather than planning new projects. Congress authorizes the Corps to construct dams and water resources infrastructure, with each dam operated to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has also included additional requirements, such as for fish and wildlife conservation, through general legislation. The Corps has authority to provide M&I water supply at certain reservoirs. The 1958 WSA allows for storage reallocation at 44 Corps reservoirs. The 1944 authority allows temporary M&I water use from surplus water. This report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps. The 1958 Water Supply Act (WSA) allows the Corps to reallocate storage at certain reservoirs for municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply. Congress limited the agency's decision-making authority without approval for major changes. M&I water supply can be provided as long as it aligns with the reservoir's authorized purposes, requiring congressional approval for significant impacts. The 1958 Water Supply Act allows the Corps to reallocate storage at reservoirs for municipal and industrial water supply. Congressional approval is needed for major changes that significantly affect authorized purposes. The Corps developed guidelines for this authority, including criteria for when reallocation does not require approval. The Corps has faced scrutiny for exceeding its discretionary authority by reallocating storage at Lake Lanier without seeking congressional approval. A court order in 2009 agreed with litigants that the Corps violated the 1958 Water Supply Act by making operational changes for municipal and industrial water supply without approval. It was estimated that over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage, roughly 260,000 acre-feet, was reallocated since the mid-1970s without authorization. The Corps reallocated 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without authorization since the mid-1970s, totaling 260,000 acre-feet. Operational changes shifted storage to M&I supply, exceeding discretionary authority. Questions arise about water reallocation at other Corps facilities with 135 reservoirs having 11 million acre-feet for M&I water, some authorized under the 1958 WSA. More than 50,000 AF of storage space has been reallocated for M&I use. The Corps reallocated storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, exceeding the agency's policy limit without congressional approval. The reallocation was approved in 1985 with a compensation arrangement for lost hydropower. The Corps found that the transfer would not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes and did not require significant structural modifications. The Corps exceeded the agency's policy limit for reallocations at Lake Texoma for M&I use in 1985. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake represents a mix of project-specific direction from Congress and discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. Concerns were raised about whether the studies evaluating reallocations sufficiently assessed potential impacts on authorized purposes and operational changes. The 2009 court order questioned the Corps' evaluations of reallocations at Lake Lanier and raised concerns about unauthorized withdrawals at Lake Cumberland. Many Corps dams have evolved operations over time, with M&I water supply at Lake Lanier being the most controversial. The extent of unauthorized withdrawals at other Corps facilities is largely unknown. The 2009 court order raised concerns about reallocations at Lake Lanier and other Corps facilities. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA generally met the Corps' criteria. Congress's view on the Corps' discretionary authority for reallocations is becoming more relevant. Issues include how multiple reallocations in a basin are handled and the agency's discretion in making agreements with stakeholders. The current policies on reallocations at Corps facilities involve decisions on handling multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, financial arrangements, unauthorized withdrawals, and transition plans for reallocations to municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply. Questions arise on how to charge for M&I storage space, credit for return flows, and the federal role in municipal water supply, especially in the face of potential climate change effects like extended drought.

Addressing the challenges of changing federal water supply operations in response to climate change is complicated by differing opinions and the difficulty of enacting significant changes due to the various affected constituencies."
