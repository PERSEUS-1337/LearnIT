    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Every Child Deserves a Family Act\". Congressional findings and purposes are outlined. Congress finds a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster children in the child welfare system, leading to thousands of foster children without permanent homes. To open more homes to foster children, agencies should eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status in adoption and foster care procedures. Over 101,000 children in the US foster care system are legally free for adoption, with many facing risks like poverty and homelessness if they \"age out\" of the system. Increasing adoption rates and establishing permanency for foster youth can lead to significant national cost savings. LGBT youth often face discrimination and violence in the foster care system. Many homeless LGBT youth have a history of being in foster care. A significant percentage of same-sex couple households have children. The Williams Institute estimates that millions of LGBT individuals have children. The Williams Institute estimates that millions of LGBT individuals have children, with same-sex couples raising adopted children being older, educated, and economically stable. Studies confirm that children with same-sex parents have the same advantages and expectations for health, social, and psychological development as children with heterosexual parents. However, \\1/3\\ of child welfare agencies in the United States reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants, reducing the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents overall. This practice denies opportunities for LGBT individuals to become foster parents for their own kin or adopt their own kin from foster care. According to the Williams Institute, over 3,400 children are in foster care with same-sex couples, and 22,000 children are raised by same-sex adoptive couples. If more states discriminated against qualified individuals based on sexual orientation, foster care costs could increase by $87-130 million annually. Some states allow one member of a same-sex couple to adopt but do not recognize both as legal parents, denying children equal rights and security. Professional organizations in various fields support the rights of qualified LGBTQ+ couples to foster and adopt children, citing research showing sexual orientation does not impact parental success. Discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in foster care is not in the best interest of children. The Act aims to expedite permanency for children in need of loving families. The Act aims to decrease wait times for children in foster care to find permanent loving families and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in adoption and foster care placements. SEC. 3. EVERY CHILD DESERVES A FAMILY. An entity receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the person or child involved. They also cannot delay placements or require additional screenings based on these factors. The section prohibits discrimination in placement decisions based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It defines placement decision and allows for legal action in case of violation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide guidance for compliance within 6 months of enactment. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to ensure compliance with the Act, including identifying and addressing inconsistent laws and practices, and expanding recruitment efforts without discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The Act requires cultural competency training for adoptive and foster parents, as well as judges and attorneys involved in foster care and adoption cases. Entities receiving Federal assistance must comply within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year of the Act's enactment, with a possible extension for states amending laws. The Secretary may extend compliance dates for States and entities involved in adoption/foster care placements. Non-compliance may result in withholding funds under title IV of the Social Security Act. A GAO study will assess State compliance with the Act within 5 years of enactment. States must study if they have complied with the Act by eliminating barriers based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status for adoptive or foster parents and children. This includes removing discriminatory policies and procedures for placement decisions. The Comptroller General must report to Congress the results of a study on eliminating discriminatory barriers based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status for adoptive or foster parents and children."
