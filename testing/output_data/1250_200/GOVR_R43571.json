    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific fields or professions. Over 50 such programs are authorized, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are offered by the federal government to forgive, cancel, or discharge student loan debt in exchange for service in public service or specific occupations. These programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter or remain in certain professions and offer debt relief after repaying loans based on income for a period of time. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions. Other forms of debt relief include loan discharge for disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, and successful defense assertion. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, provided low-interest loans to college students to improve education programs for national security. Loan forgiveness was also available for borrowers, marking an early federal student loan forgiveness initiative. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, provided low-interest loans to college students to improve education programs for national security. Congress authorized a student loan forgiveness component for students who taught full-time in public schools, with benefits expanded over the years to include teachers in schools with low-income students or disabilities, Head Start program participants, and those in the Armed Forces. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service. The Federal Perkins Loan Program was established in 1965 and later renamed through amendments in 1986. Other federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were created for borrowers in high-need areas. Over 50 such programs currently exist, providing brief descriptions of each authorized program. The curr_chunk provides brief descriptions of over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs aim to provide debt relief to borrowers through various criteria such as service types, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. Each program has unique characteristics and features. Readers seeking comprehensive details are encouraged to refer to additional resources like federal statutes and regulations. The various federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have unique characteristics and criteria. Borrowers may need to work in specific roles or locations, or repay based on income-driven plans to qualify for benefits. The programs aim to provide debt relief through different means. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs require borrowers to repay according to an income-driven plan for a specified period to qualify for benefits. At the end of the term, some or all of the qualifying student loan debt is forgiven. The availability of benefits may be an entitlement or at the discretion of the program administrator. Loan forgiveness benefits are broadly available to qualified borrowers. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to borrowers of qualified loans through specific eligibility criteria outlined in loan documents. These benefits are funded through mandatory appropriations and fall into two categories: forgiveness for public service employment and forgiveness following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for service in specific roles, with the administrator either repaying some or all of the borrower's debt or providing funding. Loan repayment programs administer debt relief by repaying some or all of a borrower's student loan debt or providing funding for repayment. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or shortages, recruit and retain qualified employees, and serve as additional compensation. Availability of loan repayment benefits is limited and discretionary, subject to fund appropriations. Borrowers may incur federal income tax liability. The types of debt relief programs examined in this report vary in terms of federal income tax liability. Forgiveness under employment-focused programs is tax-exempt, while forgiveness under income-driven repayment or public service employment programs may incur tax liability. Loan repayment programs aim to address employment needs and may result in tax liability for borrowers. Federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs encompass forgiveness for public service employment and income-driven repayment. Eligible loans include federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, loans under the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Some programs also consider private education loans for forgiveness. Federal student loans eligible for forgiveness or repayment include loans from the Direct Loan program, the FFEL program (until June 30, 2010), and the Federal Perkins Loan program (until September 30, 2017). Loans in the Direct Loan program are government-funded and administered by ED, while FFEL program loans were made by nonfederal lenders. In the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital, while nonprofit guaranty agencies administered federal loan insurance and loan forgiveness benefits. The Perkins Loan program involved loans made by institutions of higher education with a mix of federal and institutional capital, with the institution acting as the lender responsible for loan origination, servicing, and loan cancelation benefits. The Direct Loan program offers Direct Subsidized Loans to undergraduate students with financial need, with interest subsidies during enrollment and grace periods. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to all students without financial need requirements. Borrowing limits apply, with $21.5 billion in Direct Subsidized Loans issued in FY2017. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest, with the option to defer payments until repayment status. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were issued. Direct PLUS Loans are non-need-based loans available to parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students, with no explicit borrowing limits mentioned. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan and extend the repayment period. Loans made through federal student loan programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA and other programs can be consolidated into a single loan, allowing for extension of forgiveness and repayment benefits. Direct Consolidation Loans have a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made. Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate students. Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate students with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Borrowers engaged in public service may have a portion of their loans cancelled. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million were made. HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students, making 20,849 loans in 2016-2017 for a total of $162.8 million. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students pursuing degrees in various fields. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 6,842 loans totaling $64.2 million for certain programs, and 252 loans totaling for another program. Loan recipients must fulfill service requirements or repay loans at a higher interest rate. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various fields. Recipients must meet service requirements or repay loans at a higher interest rate. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million for one program and 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for another program. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various fields. Recipients must meet service requirements or repay loans at a higher interest rate. Nursing schools select financially needy participants who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States for loans to become qualified nursing school faculty. The program provided 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million in the academic year 2016-2017. Additionally, the Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, no longer making new loans, continues to administer outstanding loans for students pursuing degrees in various medical fields. The HEAL program provided loans to students pursuing degrees in various medical fields between 1995 and 1999. Although new loans are no longer available, borrowers are still responsible for repayment. Private student loans are also common, offered by entities like banks and state-supported programs, with terms set by the lender. Some federal loan repayment programs may offer benefits to borrowers of private education loans. Education loans are not part of federal loan programs, but some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. These programs provide debt relief to eligible borrowers, each with unique characteristics. They are categorized based on qualifying criteria and program components such as qualifying service types, borrower economic circumstances, debt relief amounts and timing, and exclusions. This helps in comparing and examining the programs using common terminology. The section discusses primary categories of debt relief programs based on borrower economic circumstances, amounts, and timing of debt relief. It includes loan forgiveness entitlement programs, loan repayment for public service or employment needs, and loan repayment for public service in government employment. Programs are presented in order of potential availability and scale. For more details on specific programs, refer to Appendix A. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or employers. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms. Table 1 summarizes the various forgiveness programs based on employer and occupation requirements. Table 1 summarizes loan forgiveness programs based on specific occupation requirements, economic circumstances during repayment, and operational status. Benefits are available to a wide array of borrowers, but eligibility criteria include completing a specific service or entering a particular occupation. Programs are listed by size of benefits available, with options for teachers, law enforcement personnel, public defenders, and a broader range of individuals. Loan forgiveness programs are available for public service occupations like law enforcement personnel and public defenders, as well as for individuals employed full-time in public service, including government agencies and certain nonprofit organizations. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, with service commitments ranging from 1 to 10 years. These programs provide debt relief for borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not fully repaid their debt. The benefits are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans and are distinct from programs targeting public service employment. Loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are widely available to qualified borrowers, distinct from those targeting public service employment. Table 2 summarizes these programs, organized by eligibility date and not grouped by availability or financial resources. These programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements. Under income-driven repayment plans, borrowers make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20-25 years based on factors like debt amount and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. After the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment loan forgiveness benefits specific occupations or employers, providing debt relief to borrowers in those roles. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are used to meet employment needs or shortages, and to help government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These programs are not entitlements and are subject to limited availability and program funds. They are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Table 3 summarizes the various loan repayment programs available for addressing broad employment needs or shortages. Repayment benefits may be available to borrowers employed with a single specified employer, multiple eligible employers, or no particular employer. Loan repayment programs for public service employment address employment needs or shortages by providing repayment benefits to borrowers based on their employment status and economic circumstances. Table 3 organizes these programs by operational status and administering department, illustrating the variety of employment needs they aim to meet. There are 19 programs in total, with 15 being targeted towards specific criteria. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, data on availability and financial resources are inconsistently available for these programs. Loan repayment programs target various employment needs, with 15 out of 19 programs focused on health-related occupations. These programs aim to address shortages in healthcare providers and faculty, as well as other professions like legal occupations and large animal veterinarians. Borrowers may work for multiple employers within a certain class, with some programs requiring service in underserved areas. Service commitments typically range from one to five years. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees have service commitments lasting between one and five years. These programs are tailored to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are typically smaller in scale. The Office of Personnel Management reports on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program annually, detailing the number of agencies participating, beneficiaries, and benefits received. Various loan repayment programs are offered by federal agencies to recruit and retain qualified employees, with benefits available to borrowers employed by a single agency or federal government employers. Table 4 displays federal loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, including those in the Armed Forces. There are 25 programs, with 8 specifically for military members. The programs vary in eligibility criteria, including employment in specified occupations and economic circumstances assessment. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources. There are 25 federal loan repayment programs, with 8 targeting Armed Forces members. Eligibility varies based on occupation and economic circumstances. Service commitments typically range from one to five years. Borrowers' economic situations may impact eligibility for benefits. Forgiveness and loan repayment programs consider a borrower's economic circumstances to qualify for benefits. Eligibility can be based on economic circumstances at borrowing or during repayment. Factors like family background and income percentage play a role. Programs vary in the amount and schedule of benefits provided to qualified borrowers. Several programs offer forgiveness of outstanding student loans through various methods such as forgiving the entire balance after a certain number of payments or offering repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Many federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on eligibility, including limitations for defaulted borrowers and restrictions on receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. Some programs require U.S. citizenship and may penalize borrowers who do not complete their service term. Many federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility restrictions, including penalties for not completing service terms. Some programs do not allow benefits from multiple programs for the same service, while others require U.S. citizenship for participation. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility restrictions based on the type of loan, such as federal student loans under the Higher Education Act. Programs like PSLF are only available for certain types of loans and borrowers' citizenship and immigration status. Defaulted loans may restrict access to benefits, depending on the program and loan characteristics. In the Teachers program, borrowers may be eligible for loan forgiveness if they have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, defaulted borrowers may qualify for forgiveness under certain conditions. Clawback provisions may require beneficiaries to repay benefits if service obligations are not met, common in federal loan forgiveness programs. Some loan forgiveness programs require repayment if obligations are not met, with provisions for punitive fees. Student loan forgiveness may be exempt from income tax in certain cases, as specified by program statutes. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits from certain programs may be excluded from gross income if specific conditions are met, as outlined in IRC Section 108(f). This includes loans borrowed for education from qualified institutions with terms for cancellation based on work in certain professions or for specific employers. Exclusions also apply to programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. If the requirements are not met, individuals are responsible for paying any associated income tax liability. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in incentivizing individuals to enter specific fields or government service. Approximately $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness. Recipients of these benefits can avoid significant taxation if their benefits are excluded from gross income. When evaluating the impact of loan forgiveness programs, key issues include whether individuals would choose certain fields without debt relief, if student loan debt is the main barrier to entry, and if debt relief encourages higher loan financing. Additionally, the cost to the government is a factor. In assessing the impact of loan forgiveness and repayment programs on employment choices, it is important to consider if recipients would have pursued qualifying service without the program. Evaluations comparing career paths of individuals with access to these benefits and those without have not been widely conducted for federal programs, but data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed positive outcomes for loan repayment recipients in medical research careers. The NIH loan repayment program encourages individuals to pursue medical research and helps retain them in the field. Recipients were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH and in general. While the program may be effective, other factors also influence career choices. Loan repayment programs may be ineffective depending on job availability. In recent years, law school graduates faced limited private sector opportunities, leading some to take public interest or government jobs. While some individuals may have taken a job without loan repayment benefits, evidence shows that in certain cases, participants would not have accepted a position without this incentive. For example, the NIH found that recipients of loan repayment awards had competing job offers and viewed the potential for loan repayment as an attractive benefit unique to NIH employment. The NIH found that loan repayment benefits were a unique and attractive incentive for recipients, especially for physicians with competing job offers. These benefits also increased the likelihood of physicians staying in research at the NIH, showing that loan repayment can be a valuable recruitment and retention tool. However, the effectiveness of loan repayment programs may be undermined by uncertain funding and insufficient award amounts as incentives for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Loan repayment programs may not offer sufficient incentives for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Researchers suggest that financial benefits need to offset a significant portion of education costs to be successful. Additionally, tax liabilities on loan repayment benefits can make the programs less attractive. Some agencies estimate that taxes can account for 39% of the repayment amount, reducing the program's appeal. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may not be attractive to participants if benefits are taxed, leading to turnover and instability in the workforce. The assumption that student loan debt heavily influences career decisions may not always hold true, as other factors also play a role in job choices. Career choices can be influenced by various factors, including debt, but it may not always be the primary determinant. Other deterrents, such as lower compensation or personal preferences, can also impact job decisions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, like the NHSCLRP, aim to incentivize professionals to work in specific areas or fields. Debt levels may play a role in career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups, but programs are available for individuals where debt is not a factor. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter lower-paying fields like primary care medicine, but the financial inducement may not fully compensate for the lifetime earnings gap between specialties. High levels of debt can influence job choices, with studies showing that it can lead graduates to work at larger firms where they can earn more. Graduates with higher debt levels tend to choose higher-paying jobs at large law firms, rather than education-related fields, government agencies, or nonprofits. Law school debt may not heavily influence career choices, as demographic factors play a more significant role. Loan repayment programs may not impact the career decisions of law school graduates significantly. The issue of loan forgiveness and repayment programs revolves around whether these programs incentivize students to take on more student loan debt for their education. Programs like income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness offer debt relief after a certain period of capped payments based on income. Critics argue that tying payments to income rather than debt may encourage students to borrow more than necessary. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may encourage student over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government, including loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. The federal student loan programs offer benefits through federal credit programs like the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program and the Federal Family Education Loan program. Loan subsidy costs are funded through mandatory appropriations, and costs are measured based on estimated long-term costs to the government. Administrative costs are separate and expressed on a cash basis. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs by altering expected cash flows. In the Direct Loan program, loan forgiveness benefits such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers are available to qualified borrowers. The government discharges a portion of the borrower's loan balance, resulting in reduced cash flows to the government and increased loan subsidy costs. Other programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans also offer loan forgiveness benefits. Loan repayment programs do not include the direct costs of borrower benefits in subsidy rates. Loan repayment programs, such as IBR and ICR, do not include borrower benefits in subsidy rates. Funding for these programs comes from appropriations for the fiscal year, either discretionary or mandatory. Availability of benefits depends on funding, leading to potential limitations in extending benefits to all eligible borrowers. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include GESLR and JRJ Loan Repayment, while the National Health Service Corps is funded through mandatory appropriations. The Perkins Loan Cancellation program is unique in its funding method, not being a federal credit program. While most loan forgiveness programs are funded through federal credit programs, Perkins Loans are not. Funding for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits comes from discretionary appropriations, with the last appropriation made in FY2009. Despite no recent funding, eligible borrowers have still had their loans canceled as institutions absorb the costs. The Perkins Loan program is unique in its funding method, with institutions absorbing the costs of loan cancellation for eligible borrowers despite no recent funding being appropriated. Administrative costs for loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately through various methods. Loan repayment programs are funded differently across agencies, with discretionary appropriations for federal student aid administration. Limited information is available on the actual costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs, with estimates provided for future benefits. Data on benefits provided and recipients is available for some programs in a program-by-program basis. In Appendix A, data on debt relief provided and recipients for various loan forgiveness programs are presented. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated government costs were $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012. For the REPAYE repayment plan, approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible, with an estimated cost of $15.4 billion. The REPAYE repayment plan is estimated to cost approximately $15.4 billion, with around 2 million borrowers expected to enroll. The PAYE repayment plan is projected to cost $2.1 billion over a 10-year period, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers opting for the plan. About 400,000 borrowers are estimated to receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment, with an average forgiven loan balance of $41,000. Additionally, around 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts are expected to choose the IBR plan. Approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts are expected to choose the IBR plan for loan repayment, with estimates on forgiveness benefits not provided. Loan forgiveness benefits are difficult to precisely estimate due to the newness of the programs and the contingent nature of borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, including whether multiple programs offering similar benefits for borrowers engaging in similar activities are optimal. Additionally, the structure of these programs and the potential for financial windfalls for borrowers should be examined. Overlapping programs may result in the same borrower receiving benefits from multiple programs or multiple programs serving the same group of individuals. Multiple federal programs may offer similar benefits to borrowers, potentially leading to the same borrower receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. Without restrictions, individuals could qualify for benefits under multiple programs, resulting in the federal government spending money on administrative costs for overlapping programs. For example, an individual could receive loan repayment benefits under one program while also qualifying for student loan forgiveness after a certain period of service. The federal government may fund multiple programs that offer similar benefits to borrowers, potentially leading to individuals receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. For example, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty by providing repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) aim to increase qualified nursing faculty by providing repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The NFLRP grants money to nursing schools for their own loan repayment programs, potentially creating an administrative burden for the HRSA. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that offer double benefits or serve the same purpose to the same group of individuals. Loan forgiveness programs aim to encourage individuals to enter specified jobs or public service roles that may be hard to fill. Loan forgiveness programs aim to recruit individuals for jobs or public service roles that may be hard to fill. Concerns have been raised about the lack of limits on forgiveness amounts, potentially leading to individuals borrowing more than necessary. Congress may need to consider establishing limits on forgiveness amounts under certain programs. Some research suggests that loan forgiveness programs may not always influence individuals' career decisions. Congress could consider implementing more specific funding controls to tailor these programs to individual needs. Congress may consider implementing more specific funding controls for loan forgiveness programs to tailor them to individual needs. Insufficient data are available on federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for many programs, and for some, data will only become available once borrowers apply for benefits. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must remain employed in a public service job for 10 years while making 120 monthly payments on their loans. Limited or no programmatic data are available for programs where no benefits have yet been awarded. Limited data is available on federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. Borrowers must meet specific criteria, such as remaining employed in a public service job for 10 years and making 120 monthly payments, to qualify for forgiveness benefits. However, little is known about the actual forgiveness benefits received under these programs, as data collection is limited and longitudinal data are not consistently collected. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods, but these programs have not been in existence long enough for borrowers to qualify for forgiveness benefits. Improved data collection and reporting are necessary for assessing program effects and potential design changes to enhance effectiveness. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief across different programs. Some programs have specific limitations on the types or amounts of debt eligible for relief, while others offer forgiveness for multiple loan types with fewer restrictions. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Concerns have been raised about the availability of these programs potentially incentivizing students to over-borrow. Should limits be established on borrowing non-need-based federal student loans to finance expenses that would otherwise be covered by expected family contributions, with a substantial portion being discharged through forgiveness or repayment programs? Selection criteria for student loan repayment programs can vary among federal agencies, with 34 agencies providing loan repayment benefits in CY 2016. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse the agency if they do not complete their service. Employees in certain positions are not eligible for these programs. Participants in federal student loan repayment programs must not be employees in the excepted service with certain policy-related roles. Agencies have flexibility in determining who receives benefits, leading to variations in eligibility requirements. For example, the Department of Defense uses the program for recruitment in specific fields, while the Department of State limits benefits to those with a minimum loan balance. Tailored programs across agencies may limit the overall effectiveness of attracting qualified individuals to work in the federal government. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on various federal student loan repayment programs, including statutory citations, program purposes, eligible loans, service requirements, benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, tax treatment, budget classification, funding amounts, loan discharges, beneficiary numbers, and additional resources. Information is sourced from statutes, regulations, agency websites, and authoritative sources. The curr_chunk provides descriptions of federal student loan repayment programs, including statutory citations, program purposes, eligible loans, service requirements, benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, tax treatment, budget classification, funding amounts, loan discharges, and additional resources. Information is sourced from authoritative sources, and programs are described as of the date of the report. Abbreviations like FFEL and PHSA are used, and programs are presented in a specific order. Loan forgiveness programs for public service employment are presented in this section, providing debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or employers. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers forgiveness for the balance of principal and interest on Direct Loan program loans for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments after October 1, 2007. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers loan forgiveness for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments on eligible loans while employed full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Qualifying service includes employment in public service organizations, AmeriCorps, or the Peace Corps. Public service organizations must provide specific public services to qualify. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers loan forgiveness after 120 qualifying monthly payments for borrowers in public service. Eligible services include emergency management, military, law enforcement, education, and public health. Borrowers must make full, on-time payments under specific repayment plans and be employed full-time in public service. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires borrowers to make 120 qualifying monthly payments while employed full-time in public service. Religious activities are not considered part of public service. Loan forgiveness amount is tax-exempt and classified as mandatory funding. Borrowers first became eligible for forgiveness in October 2017. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program encourages individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession by offering loan repayment benefits for serving as a full-time teacher for at least five consecutive years in designated schools or education service agencies. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, and Consolidation Loans used to repay Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loans. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program requires full-time teaching for at least five consecutive years in designated schools or education service agencies. Borrowers must be \"highly qualified teachers\" and can receive up to $5,000 or $17,500 for special education or math/science teachers. Loan repayment benefits are available with forbearance options. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program offers loan forgiveness for federal student loans obtained before October 1, 1998, after five years of teaching service. The forgiven amount is tax-exempt and falls under mandatory budgetary classification. Amounts forgiven for FFEL and Direct Loan program loans vary annually. In FY2013-FY2017, loan amounts increased from $106.8 million to $230.9 million. Beneficiaries for FFEL program loans decreased from 22,038 to 17,342, while Direct Loan program loans increased from 12,951 to 24,955. The Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation program offers forgiveness for Perkins Loans for public service employment. Eligible loan types are Federal Perkins Loans. The Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation program offers forgiveness for Perkins Loans for public service employment in various occupations such as teachers, military personnel, nurses, and firefighters. Maximum benefit amount is based on years of service completed. Perkins Loan cancellation is based on years of service completed, with up to 100% of the loan balance cancelled over a 5-year period. Different rates apply for various types of service, with restrictions on eligibility. Borrowers can also defer payments during qualifying service. Perkins Loan cancellation is based on years of service completed, with up to 100% of the loan balance cancelled over a 5-year period. Restrictions on eligibility include service performed after loan disbursement, a complete year of service consisting of 12 consecutive months, and loans not in default. Loan cancellation cannot be provided for the same service used for AmeriCorps education awards. Funding for Perkins Loan cancellations is classified as discretionary for congressional budget purposes, with no appropriations since FY2009. Amounts discharged or repaid and annual number of beneficiaries are currently unavailable. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment provides debt relief to borrowers who repay their federal student loans based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans, potentially available to qualified borrowers without specific occupational requirements. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) program allows borrowers of Direct Loan program loans to make payments based on a formula considering their federal student loan debt, family size, and adjusted gross income. After 25 years of repayment, any remaining loan balance is forgiven. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must meet specific criteria to qualify for forgiveness benefits. To qualify for forgiveness benefits under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) program, borrowers must make payments for 25 years, including periods under specific repayment plans. Monthly payments are capped at 20% of discretionary income, and any remaining loan balance is forgiven after 25 years. Borrowers must not be in default and provide annual documentation of their adjusted gross income. Borrowers must not be in default on their loans and provide annual documentation of their AGI for repayment plans like REPAYE, PAYE, ICR, or IBR. The amount of forgiven student loans is taxable income, and borrowers are responsible for any resulting tax obligation after 25 years of repayment under the ICR plan. Loan forgiveness is mandatory and included in student loan subsidy costs. Currently, no borrowers have qualified for forgiveness after 25 years of repayment under the ICR plan. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan allows borrowers of Direct Loan and FFEL program loans to make payments based on a formula considering their federal student loan debt, family size, and adjusted gross income. After 25 years of repayment, any remaining loan balance is forgiven. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, PLUS Loans for graduate students, and Consolidation Loans. To qualify for forgiveness benefits, borrowers must make payments towards their outstanding loans for 25 years. Monthly payments are capped at 15% of discretionary income. There is no maximum benefit amount, and any remaining loan balance after 25 years is forgiven. Borrowers must not be in default and provide annual documentation of their AGI during repayment. Borrowers must annually provide documentation of their AGI and family size for loan forgiveness after 25 years of repayment according to specific plans. The forgiven amount is taxable, and borrowers are responsible for any resulting tax obligation. Budgetary classification is mandatory, and the forgiven amounts are included in student loan subsidy costs. Borrowers have not yet qualified for loan forgiveness after 25 years. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) Repayment Plan allows certain borrowers of Direct Loan program loans to make payments based on their loan debt, family size, and income, with remaining balance forgiven after 20 years. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans.
