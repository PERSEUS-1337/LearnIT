The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2007\" allows states to create modified employability plans for recipients of assistance with disabilities or caring for a family member with a disability. The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2007\" allows states to create modified employability plans for recipients of assistance with disabilities or caring for a family member with a disability, which may include reasonable modifications of work activities and hourly participation requirements based on the recipient's needs. The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2007\" permits states to develop tailored employability plans for recipients with disabilities, outlining services, supports, and modifications provided, in cooperation with the recipient, and reviewed every 6 months. Recipients are considered engaged in work for a month if the state deems them substantially involved, impacting monthly participation rates. The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2007\" allows states to create customized employability plans for disabled recipients, ensuring compliance with activities and participation requirements. States must submit annual reports for fiscal years where recipients are considered engaged in work under modified plans. The State must submit an annual report on TANF recipients with modified employability plans due to disability, including the number of recipients and their compliance with activities. The State must submit an annual report on TANF recipients with modified employability plans due to disability, including details on prevalent types of impairments and the percentage of cases with modified plans for recipients with disabilities. The annual report on TANF recipients with modified employability plans due to disability should include details on prevalent types of modifications in work activities or hours, qualifications of staff involved in determining disabilities and developing modified plans. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on State efforts to engage individuals with disabilities in work activities, including the number of individuals for whom each State has developed a modified employability plan. The annual report to Congress includes details on individuals with disabilities in work activities, such as the types of impairments for disability determination and modifications in employability plans. The annual report to Congress includes information on individuals with disabilities participating in work activities and the impact of modified employability plans on states' achievement of minimum participation rates. The term 'disability' is defined as a mental or physical impairment, including substance abuse. The term 'disability' refers to a mental or physical impairment, including substance abuse, that significantly hinders employment or limits major life activities. Modified work activities are determined by the State to help recipients become employable without affecting participation rates. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section shall take effect on October 1, 2007. State has the option to exclude SSI applicants in work participation rate. The Social Security Act is amended to allow states to exclude certain individuals from work requirements, such as single custodial parents of young children or applicants for SSI or SSDI benefits. The State can exclude individuals from work requirements if they have filed for benefits, meet disability criteria, have no final denial of benefits, and are reviewed every 6 months to ensure they still meet the criteria. The amendments made by this section allow the State to disregard individuals from work requirements if they meet disability criteria for supplemental security income or social security disability insurance benefits. Effective date is October 1, 2007."
