    "content": "North Korea's development of prohibited weapons and illicit activities has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities have continued to grow. The U.S. has security, political, and human rights concerns in the region due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are at risk from North Korean missiles. North Korea's rapid advances in nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to U.S. troops and civilians in South Korea and Japan. The potential for conflict or regime collapse in Pyongyang could have severe economic implications globally. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea, as they navigate dealing with a totalitarian regime resistant to outside influences. The Kim family's totalitarian control in North Korea has allowed the regime to resist outside influences and maintain a large military as a deterrent. This militarization, along with provocative behavior and limited interactions with the outside world, has hindered economic growth. Despite signs of a strengthening economy, most of the population remains impoverished, and increased access to outside information could lead to further challenges. Korea's internal situation remains difficult, with most of the population deeply impoverished. Congress has significant influence on U.S. policy towards North Korea, setting terms for trade restrictions and passing the North Korean Human Rights Act. Past nuclear agreements involved Congress authorizing millions in aid, with conditions based on North Korean compliance. Future aid for denuclearization or diplomatic relations would require Congressional authorization and appropriation of funds. North Korea's rapid advancements in missile and nuclear capabilities have heightened the threat to the United States. Congress plays a crucial role in overseeing North Korea's actions and has held numerous hearings on various topics related to the regime. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is close to being able to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile, making it a top national security concern. Pyongyang's threats span across different domains including nuclear weapons, missile technology, artillery, and cyberattacks. North Korea's threats have increased in various domains, including nuclear weapons, missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack and adopted a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang into changing its behavior through economic and diplomatic measures. The Trump Administration adopted a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce North Korea into changing its behavior through economic and diplomatic measures. This included leading the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions and pushing countries to cut ties with North Korea. The Administration also emphasized the option of launching a preventive military strike against North Korea. The Trump Administration's approach towards North Korea included the option of a preventive military strike. There were shifts in public statements causing confusion about U.S. policy. North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics led to warmer relations, culminating in a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in Singapore. Kim and Trump met in Singapore on June 12, 2018, to discuss North Korea's nuclear program, building peace on the Korean Peninsula, and future U.S.-North Korea relations. Kim pursued diplomacy due to factors like harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, sanctions limiting North Korea's economy, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program, peace on the Korean Peninsula, and future U.S.-North Korea relations. They issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees, denuclearization, normalization of relations, and recovering POW/MIA remains. Follow-on negotiations will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The United States agreed to suspend military exercises with South Korea and expressed a hope of withdrawing troops stationed in South Korea. The Defense Department cancelled the annual U.S.-South Korea exercises. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, while supporters highlighted the suspension of missile and nuclear tests. Critics pointed out the lack of a timeframe in the agreement. The agreement to suspend missile and nuclear tests by North Korea has raised concerns about the lack of a clear timeframe for denuclearization and verification mechanisms. Some analysts believe that North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay the process and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining existing sanctions while engaging with North Korea remains a challenge. Implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea has been challenging amid engagement efforts. The UNSC has adopted multiple resolutions since 2006 to impose sanctions on North Korea for its weapons programs, targeting arms sales, WMD-related trade, individuals involved in WMD activities, and luxury goods transfers. Sanctions were expanded after North Korea's fourth nuclear test in 2016, with a total of 10 resolutions adopted by December 2017. Since North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, there has been a significant expansion of U.N. sanctions, with six resolutions adopted by December 2017. These sanctions now ban various financial interactions, trade in specific industrial sectors, and activities with North Korean entities. As a result, most of North Korea's major export items are now prohibited in international markets, leading to a decline of over 30% in exports in 2017 compared to 2016. The Obama and Trump Administrations have also urged countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond U.N. requirements. The Trump Administration has continued aggressive sanctions on North Korea, going beyond UNSC requirements. The US has imposed unilateral sanctions, including executive orders by Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump. Congress passed North Korea-specific statutes, limiting trade and imposing consequences on US-North Korea relations. U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act have limited trade to humanitarian goods, prohibited financial transactions and new investments, restricted foreign aid, and prohibited transactions with designated North Korean entities. Travel to North Korea is limited and requires a special validation passport. North Korea's behavior in negotiations has been inconsistent, with demands changing over time. They have vacillated between cooperation and provocations, such as testing missiles and nuclear devices. Pyongyang's willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. Economic desperation can drive North Korea to engage in talks to extract aid. North Korea exploits divisions among parties and stalls negotiations. Some analysts argue negotiations are necessary for reducing conflict and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. This could lead to a basic bargain for denuclearization in exchange for security, end of Korean War, and economic benefits. Kim Jong-un's emphasis on economic development in 2018 is seen as a sign of potential denuclearization. Many analysts doubt North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing their demands as tactical moves for regime survival. Despite pledges at the Singapore summit, Pyongyang continues to assert its determination to maintain and modernize its nuclear deterrent. North Korea has declared its nuclear weapons as non-negotiable and essential for regime security. The country aims to strengthen and modernize its nuclear deterrent, with the constitution being revised to label North Korea as a \"nuclear-armed nation.\" The successful test of the Hwasong-15 missile in 2017 marked a significant milestone in achieving a state nuclear force. North Korea insists on keeping its nuclear stockpile until global disarmament occurs, citing Libya's abandonment of nuclear weapons as a cautionary tale. The 2018 Singapore summit is seen as a potential turning point in addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some past demands. Prior to the Trump Administration's efforts, the U.S. engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea. The proposed formula for these negotiations involves North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In the 1990s, North Korea faced a nuclear crisis as it started plutonium production without international monitoring. The US considered a preemptive strike, but negotiations led to the 1994 Agreed Framework, where North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium program in exchange for aid and reactors. The Agreed Framework between North Korea and the US involved freezing North Korea's plutonium program in exchange for aid and reactors. Despite delays, North Korea froze its program, received fuel oil, and started reactor construction. However, North Korea failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA, leading to tensions with the US in 2002. This resulted in the US halting aid and construction, leading North Korea to expel IAEA inspectors, withdraw from the NPT, and restart its reactor. In response to opposition to the Agreed Framework's terms, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program. North Korea agreed to a missile testing moratorium in 1999 in exchange for partial lifting of sanctions. Talks continued, but a final agreement was elusive. Negotiations expanded under the George W. Bush Administration to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia, leading to six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003. Negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia through the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008. Despite occasional progress, the talks ultimately failed to resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. A promising breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees. However, the process broke down due to disagreements on verifying North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to denuclearization. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on denuclearization through coordination with treaty allies, pressuring China, arms interdictions, and sanctions. They sought a comprehensive deal for denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition. Additionally, multilateral and unilateral sanctions were imposed to target entities involved in illicit activities supporting North Korea's WMD programs. Following the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 to seize assets of designated DPRK officials involved in illicit activities funding North Korea's WMD programs. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction, with the US focusing on UNSC consensus and multilateral sanctions. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 briefly halted nuclear tests and missile launches by North Korea. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment activities in exchange for US assistance. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a third nuclear test in 2013. China plays a crucial role in pressuring North Korea economically and diplomatically, as it is the regime's largest trading partner and provides essential aid. Beijing's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing sees strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer between China and South Korea. China often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums like the UN. Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions against North Korea, but in 2017, China increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions. China increased enforcement of UNSC sanctions in 2017 to deter US military action against North Korea. Beijing's limited trade and aid to North Korea reflect its desire to appear responsible internationally. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with Xi Jinping prioritizing meetings with South Korean leaders over Kim. In 2017, Xi Jinping prioritized meetings with South Korean leaders over Kim Jong-un. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. China agreed to stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic opening in 2018 restored some closeness in the North Korea-China relationship. Kim traveled to Beijing to reaffirm a close relationship with China ahead of the meeting with Trump. Kim Jong-un's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 may reveal his consolidated power at the apex of the North Korean regime. Kim's confidence in asserting himself in world diplomacy suggests he has achieved new goodwill and leverage with China, following successful deescalation of hostilities and cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Kim Jong-un's consolidation of power on the world diplomatic stage is evident, with analysts crediting him for pursuing a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons. Despite initial hopes of political reform, Kim's ruthless drive to maintain the dynastic dictatorship is clear since becoming supreme leader in 2011. Kim Jong-un has demonstrated a brutal leadership style since becoming supreme leader in late 2011, carrying out purges of senior officials and even authorizing the assassination of his half-brother. He has allowed Western influences in North Korea and is more informal in public appearances compared to his father. Kim's wife has been introduced to the public, but their children remain undisclosed. Kim Jong-un's wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, while their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as Kim's attempt to appear young and modern, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung. Despite being one of the world's poorest countries, North Korea has seen economic growth under Kim, with increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities helping to mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Since early 2016, North Korea has faced tightening international sanctions, leading to a significant decline in exports. Kim Jong-un has allowed market principles to govern some sectors of the economy, legalizing consumer and business markets. He emphasizes domestic manufacturing and has seen increased stability in food production, with larger harvests since 2010. International trade with China accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade. Since 2010, North Korea has seen larger harvests due to improved planting conditions. Despite stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity. Analysts question the extent of Kim's economic reforms, as private enterprise is prohibited by the penal code. The government's tolerance for marketization is uncertain, with occasional crackdowns on market activity reported. The North Korean regime tightly controls information flows and restricts access to quality healthcare. Despite claims of universal healthcare, most hospitals are in poor condition, with only the elite having access to better facilities in Pyongyang. The government dictates where families can live based on loyalty, limiting access to medical care and medications. Defectors report growing skepticism towards government propaganda and turning to outside news sources, despite government efforts to block foreign broadcasts. The North Korean government tries to prevent its citizens from accessing foreign broadcasts by jamming stations and altering radios. Despite these efforts, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts while in the country. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls, despite being illegal. Phone conversations in North Korea are monitored, but some reports suggest that cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling operations. Increased access to information through the use of Chinese cellphones near the border could potentially weaken the North Korean regime by informing citizens about the reality of their living conditions and encouraging them to question their government. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that spreading information about the outside world within North Korea could lead to positive changes in the political system. Despite phone conversations being monitored, 28% of North Koreans own domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access \"sensitive media content.\" This access to outside sources of information could challenge the regime's decades-long indoctrination efforts. North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, with significant resources allocated to defense spending. They have deployed a large portion of their forces near the border with South Korea, focusing on developing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. The regime is believed to be developing WMD capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces, including a stockpile of chemical weapons and possibly biological weapons. Pyongyang has shown the ability to conduct offensive actions in recent years. North Korea has a large stockpile of chemical weapons and may possess biological weapons. They have developed offensive cyber capabilities and are considered a significant cyber threat by the U.S. intelligence community. Despite outdated military equipment, North Korea could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. In the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. and South Korea would likely prevail, but at a high cost. North Korean artillery forces could launch thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a conflict. North Korea's military has outdated equipment but has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years, including unmanned aerial vehicles, offensive cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and electromagnetic pulse technology. They have also made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, submarines, and special operations forces. Despite these advancements, North Korea's military suffers from institutional weaknesses that would limit its effectiveness in a major conflict. The North Korean military's command and control structure is highly centralized, with scripted and inflexible war plans. Resource scarcity affects military readiness, including lack of fuel for training and logistical shortages. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development for deterrence and coercive diplomacy. North Korea's nuclear weapons program is seen as a means of deterrence, international prestige, and coercive diplomacy. The U.S. intelligence community is skeptical of Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize, as North Korea views its nuclear arsenal as vital for survival and a deterrent against U.S. attacks. North Korea has been focused on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified nuclear warheads, with six nuclear tests conducted since 2006. North Korea has focused on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified nuclear warheads, conducting six nuclear tests since 2006. The country tested a hydrogen bomb in September 2017, claiming it was for delivery on an intercontinental ballistic missile. Despite announcing the end of nuclear tests in 2018, North Korea has not shut down its fissile material production facilities. The North Korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union. North Korea's nuclear program includes a 5MW(e) reactor at Yongbyon producing plutonium, a reprocessing plant, and a uranium enrichment facility. The country has produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for several nuclear weapons. Additionally, North Korea has explored a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium (HEU). North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, with a newly built gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon site. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine enrichment facilities exist, with one identified at Kangson in July 2018. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses suggest North Korea could produce 20 warheads by 2020. North Korea has a potential to produce 20 to 100 nuclear warheads by 2020. Despite international condemnation, North Korea has conducted numerous ballistic missile tests since 2011, aiming to improve offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile tests, and in 2017, they launched 18 missiles, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles, but their effectiveness is limited due to their age and inaccuracy. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop miniaturized warheads for long-range ballistic missiles. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula and Japan. North Korea could potentially mount nuclear warheads on ICBMs like the KN-08 and Taepodong-2. Displayed mock-ups suggest progress in missile development. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of KN-08 and KN-14 ICBMs, with initial steps taken towards fielding the system. Recent tests in 2017 showed progress in medium-range and submarine-launched ballistic missile programs, with a focus on solid fuel motors for reduced reaction times. The country aims to develop missiles capable of defeating missile defenses like Patriot and Aegis BMD. North Korea's ballistic missile test program aims to defeat or degrade missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 involved higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially overwhelming defense systems. Progress with SLBMs suggests a strategy to counter land-based defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. North Korea's ballistic missile program aims to defeat missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 involved higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially overwhelming defense systems. Progress with SLBMs suggests a strategy to counter land-based defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. Previous attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program were unsuccessful, with resolutions passed by the UNSC to restrict their ballistic missile activities. North Korea's ballistic missile program has faced restrictions from the UNSC, including Resolution 1874 in response to a 2009 test launch. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but North Korea claims it excludes satellite launches. Recent talks have not addressed missiles specifically. U.S. reports indicate North Korea has active biological and chemical weapons programs, with a large arsenal of chemical weapons including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapon production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons during a typical year and 12,000 tons during a crisis, with a current inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea's chemical weapon production capability is significant, with an estimated inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. The country is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has the infrastructure to support biological weapons and the capacity to weaponize them. South Korea and Japan are considered likely targets if North Korea were to use chemical weapons. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile-related technology is a serious concern for the United States. Pyongyang has sold missile parts and technology to several countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. North Korea has also assisted Syria with building a nuclear reactor and transferred chemical weapons-related materials to Syria. North Korea and Iran have cooperated on missile development since the 1980s. Since the 1980s, Iran's ballistic missile research centers had advisors in North Korea before the December 2012 launch, possibly contributing to its success. China may have supported North Korea's missile program, with a Chinese company selling heavy transport vehicles converted into missile launchers. North Korea engages in illicit activities like drug trafficking and counterfeiting to earn foreign currency for its weapons programs. The United States has not prioritized countering these activities, which support the North Korean regime. One North Korean agency, Office 39, oversees illicit activities generating $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies smuggling networks. In 2013, Thai authorities arrested individuals smuggling North Korean methamphetamines. North Korea sells cheap Cold War-era weapons, especially to the Middle East and North Africa. Authorities seized the Jie Shun outside the Suez Canal in August 2016. North Korea has sold arms and equipment to various states, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. In August 2016, authorities seized the Jie Shun outside the Suez Canal with over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades. The regime cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles with Iran and supplying weapons to Syria. North Korea uses front companies based in China to conceal its illicit activities and access the international financial system. In one case, a Chinese company used over 20 front companies in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars for a sanctioned North Korean bank. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of the North Korean regime, such as banning a Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system for acting as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity. The Treasury Department has frozen North Korean accounts in banks like Banco Delta Asia for distributing counterfeit currency and laundering money for the country's criminal enterprises. Past Administrations have also focused on North Korea's human rights record, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. The State Department and private organizations have highlighted North Korea's severe human rights abuses, including denial of liberties, ideological indoctrination, and physical abuse. Reports mention prison camps holding political prisoners and their families. North Korea operates multiple harsh prison camps, with conditions leading to high mortality rates among political prisoners. Reports detail starvation, disease, executions, and torture as common practices. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with a Special Rapporteur appointed in 2004. The United Nations has taken steps to address human rights violations in North Korea, including appointing a Special Rapporteur in 2004. In 2013, the UN Human Rights Council established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate grave violations of human rights in North Korea, leading to a recommendation for the situation to be referred to the International Criminal Court. However, no further action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. The UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's human rights violations, potentially for future prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans flee to China, facing abuse and trafficking risks. Refugees may also travel to Southeast Asia. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors seeking refuge in South Korea has declined, possibly due to tightened border patrols. Despite this decrease, there has been a rise in defectors with good social status, reflecting increased border security making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Elite defections in 2016, including high-ranking officials, have highlighted this changing demographic profile. Since the late 2000s, diplomats have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the North Korean regime. Elite defectors face imprisonment or execution if caught, leading many to flee to China where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating defectors, with accusations of aiding crimes against humanity. China has a history of cooperating with North Korea to arrest and send back political refugees. China's policy of repatriating North Korean defectors violates international agreements, labeling them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deporting them instead of granting asylum. This policy is based on a 1986 treaty with North Korea, making it illegal to assist the refugees in any way. Despite facing imprisonment, torture, and execution upon return to North Korea, Beijing continues to repatriate defectors. The Chinese government's policy of repatriating North Korean defectors is maintained to preserve China-North Korea ties. Beijing fears destabilization from allowing refugees into China and the potential collapse of the North Korean regime. In 2004, the North Korean Human Rights Act was passed to support human rights efforts in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed by Congress to link U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to human rights improvements in North Korea. It also established the position of a \"Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea.\" The act allows North Koreans to apply for asylum in the United States and requires the State Department to facilitate their applications. The act has been reauthorized in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with a focus on resettling North Korean refugees and increasing freedom of information into North Korea. President Trump signed the 2018 reauthorization bill. President Trump signed the North Korean Human Rights Act into law, which focuses on improving human rights in North Korea. The State Department has highlighted the harsh working conditions of North Korean overseas laborers, who are often subjected to forced labor and exploitation. The regime takes a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions of dollars to the regime. The North Korean regime exploits overseas workers, taking a large portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions of dollars annually. The labor program has a long history, with workers sent to various countries. The Trump Administration has pressured countries to send North Korean laborers home by 2019, with sanctions in place for those using North Korean labor. The United States provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with aid for food and energy. However, aid stopped in early 2009 due to North Korea's actions, including missile tests and nuclear activities. Congress rejected requests for additional funds for aid and technical assistance after these events. Congress rejected Obama Administration's requests for funds for Six-Party Talks. U.S. food aid ended in 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. North Korea has appealed for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement aimed to provide food aid. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are \"unaccounted-for.\" North Korea engaged with Senator Bob Smith on POW-MIAs. In 1996, joint investigations were agreed upon to recover remains. In 1996, North Korea and the United States agreed to joint investigations to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen missing during the Korean War. Despite difficulties, 229 sets of remains were recovered and 107 identified. However, in 2005, the U.S. suspended all joint field activities due to North Korea's nuclear ambitions and safety concerns. The DOD provided over $20 million to North Korea for assistance in recovering remains. Talks on the joint recovery program were ongoing between the two countries. In 2011, the United States and North Korea resumed talks on a joint recovery program for the remains of missing U.S. soldiers from the Korean War. However, the mission was suspended in 2012 due to North Korea's rocket launch. In 2014, North Korea warned of potential damage to the remains, signaling a desire for broader negotiations with the U.S. The Department of Defense remains committed to achieving the fullest possible accounting for POW-MIAs. The United States is committed to achieving the fullest possible accounting for POW-MIAs from the Korean War. Trump and Kim agreed to recover POW/MIA remains at the 2018 Singapore summit. North Korea turned over 55 cases of remains to the U.S. military for repatriation. North Korea requested payment for transferring the remains, but the U.S. has a policy of not paying for repatriation. Some NGOs, including religious organizations, are involved in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges in North Korea. Despite tensions between the U.S. and DPRK governments, certain U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts. These NGOs aim to provide aid to vulnerable populations and promote peaceful relations through stronger people-to-people ties. Operations have been affected by U.S. and international sanctions since 2016. Many NGOs have faced challenges in their operations in North Korea due to sanctions and restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration since 2016. Several CRS reports on North Korea cover topics such as U.S. economic sanctions, North Korean cyber capabilities, foreign assistance, U.S.-South Korea relations, ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region, and North Korea's nuclear weapons."
