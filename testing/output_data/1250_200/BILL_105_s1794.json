    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1998\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine the validity and amounts of claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq. Decision rules involve applying substantive law, international law, and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims of U.S. Armed Forces members related to Iraq's actions. The International Claims Settlement Act applies where not inconsistent with this Act. Provisions of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 apply to claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq under this Act. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims under section 2(a). The President shall allocate funds from the liquidation of assets between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for the payment of claims, with a limitation on the amount allocated for claims of the United States Government. The Secretary of State determines valid claims of the United States Government outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission for payment from the Iraq Claims Fund. SEC. 4. The President can liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims. SEC. 5. 1.5% deduction for administrative expenses. SEC. 6. Payments made from the Iraq Claims Fund. The United States Commission certifies awards to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. Payments are made towards the principal amount of the award, with further payments for claims with priority, followed by pro rata payments for all awards and accrued interest. After full payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims or rights against the Government of Iraq. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER RECORDS. The head of any Executive agency may transfer records to the United States Commission for adjudication. SEC. 8. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNUSED FUNDS. The statute of limitations for certified awards under this Act is one year after the publication date of the notice in the Federal Register.

Unused funds are defined as any remaining balance in the Fund. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
