    "content": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first known cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are digital money validated by a decentralized network instead of a centralized intermediary. Since 2009, cryptocurrencies have gained public interest and are now used in various financial transactions and products, including ICOs and derivatives. Some central banks are exploring issuing cryptocurrencies. Media coverage of cryptocurrencies is widespread, with many seeing them as the future of monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies are seen as the future of monetary systems, with some viewing them as alternative electronic payment systems. A report assesses how well cryptocurrencies perform this function, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues. The report examines risks and policy issues related to cryptocurrencies as money, focusing on facilitating criminal activity and consumer protections. Money facilitates the exchange of goods and services, avoiding the need for a barter system with double coincidences of wants. Money serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value in society. It can be represented by gold, paper currency, or digital entries. The efficiency of satisfying wants is increased when money is accepted by all. Potatoes could potentially serve as money due to their intrinsic value, but their limited tradability poses challenges. Potatoes have intrinsic value but limited tradability due to size, freshness, and divisibility issues. In contrast, gold and dollar bills are easily tradeable, divisible, and serve as effective units of account and store of value. Gold and dollars are effective units of account and store of value, with digital technology allowing for easy transfer of divisible units. The value of money has evolved over time, with early forms being precious metals. This section explores different monetary systems with varying government and bank involvement. Early forms of money were often precious metals with intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, and gold. These metals were elemental, malleable, chemically inert, scarce, and difficult to extract, making them well-suited for the functions of money. Governments also played a role in assigning value to money, with government mints making coins of precious metals. Sand could also function as money but would lead to inflation if widely used. Fiat money has no intrinsic value and derives its value from government decree. Governments control the supply of money to retain value and facilitate economic activity by mandating its use for activities like paying taxes or settling debts. The U.S. dollar is fiat money, legal tender in the United States, and maintained by the Federal Reserve through monetary policy set by the Board of Governors. The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, maintains long-term growth of monetary and credit aggregates to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate interest rates. With a money stock exceeding $14 trillion supporting an economy generating over $20 trillion in new production annually, inflation has remained below 3% since 1993. The Federal Reserve also operates electronic payment systems for interbank transfers, acting as an intermediary between banks. Banks have evolved to provide alternatives to physical currency exchange, although this system is susceptible to theft and misplacement. Banks have historically offered services for secure transfers of money between parties not in physical proximity. Customers entrust banks with their money for safekeeping and to facilitate payments to recipients elsewhere. Maintaining accurate ledgers is crucial for these services, allowing money to be held as numerical data rather than physical currency. Payment systems work by recording individuals' access to funds and executing transactions upon instruction. A payment system operates by banks recording and managing individuals' funds electronically, ensuring accuracy and security to prevent loss or theft. Trust in banks is maintained through market incentives, regulations, and measures to protect customers' money. Banks are regulated to ensure security and accuracy in managing people's money. Electronic payments face challenges like double spending, where the same digital file can be sent to multiple parties, leading to loss of value. Centralized intermediaries like banks or government institutions traditionally resolve this issue. Traditional electronic transfers of money involve a centralized intermediary like a bank or government institution to validate transactions, ensure funds availability, and update account ledgers. For example, in the United States, a retail consumer can initiate an electronic payment through a debit card transaction, where banks make necessary ledger changes to transfer funds between accounts. Electronic money transfers involve account ledgers reflecting value transfers between accounts. Significant costs and infrastructure support these systems for integrity and performance. Intermediaries, highly regulated for safety and profitability, recoup costs through fees and provide consumer protections. Intermediaries in electronic transactions must protect consumers, as mandated by laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act. These laws limit liability for unauthorized transfers and require disclosures on costs and terms. However, some individuals may lack access to electronic payment systems due to cost or geographic barriers, leading to underbanked populations. Personal information is also required for using electronic payment services, generating significant data. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems, using a network of computers to validate transactions. Users have pseudonymous accounts with public keys and private keys for security. Transactions involve transferring cryptocurrency between accounts. Cryptocurrency transactions involve transferring cryptocurrency between accounts using private keys for security. Users create a \"wallet\" with a third-party exchange or service provider to access the system, similar to authorizing payment on a website. Blockchain technology is used to validate changes to ledgers, preventing invalid alterations through cryptographic protocols. Validation of transactions in the ledger requires a member of the network to approve before irreversible changes are made. Cryptocurrency transactions require validation by network members through computational decryption before being entered into the ledger. Digital signatures secure transactions and prevent double spending, allowing parties to exchange value without trusting each other. Users are incentivized to validate transactions by receiving newly created currency units, with fees sometimes charged. Cryptocurrency transactions are validated by network members through computational decryption, with digital signatures securing transactions. Users are incentivized to validate transactions by receiving newly created currency units, and can acquire cryptocurrency on exchanges. Cryptocurrency ledgers using blockchain technology are considered secure, although hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency transactions are validated through computational decryption and digital signatures, with blockchain technology securing ledgers. Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency from exchanges and individuals. Analyzing data on cryptocurrency characteristics and usage can help measure its potential as an alternative payment source. However, challenges exist due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the vast number of cryptocurrencies in circulation. This report focuses on Bitcoin as an illustrative example, as it is the most well-known cryptocurrency with the highest total value in the industry. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency with over half of the industry's total value, experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. In 2017, its price surged from $993 to $19,650, a 1,880% increase, before dropping by 65% to $6,905. As of October 7, 2018, one Bitcoin was priced at $6,570, with approximately 17.3 million Bitcoins in circulation, totaling about $113.6 billion. Other major cryptocurrencies like Ether and Litecoin also exhibited similar price movements. The value of all Bitcoins in circulation was about $113.6 billion, with approximately 17.3 million Bitcoins in existence. Recent volatility in cryptocurrency prices suggests they may not function well as a unit of account or store of value. The number of Bitcoin transactions, averaging about 208,000 per day globally in 2018, can indicate the prevalence of Bitcoin's use as money. The number of Bitcoin transactions averaged about 208,000 per day globally in 2018. In comparison, the Automated Clearing House processed almost 59 million transactions per day in 2017, and Visa's payments systems processed over 300 million transactions per day in 2017. The use of cryptocurrencies in payment systems is still limited compared to traditional systems, but there is potential for widespread adoption in the future. Cryptocurrency proponents believe that decentralized payment systems operated through the internet could be more cost-effective than traditional systems. They argue that cryptocurrencies may offer significant cost advantages, especially for international transactions, by eliminating the need for intermediaries like government central banks and private financial institutions. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that cryptocurrency transactions, being global and not tied to government-fiat currencies, could offer cost advantages over traditional payment systems for international transfers. The high fees charged by intermediaries in traditional systems have raised concerns among policymakers. The Dodd-Frank Act included Section 1075, known as the \"Durbin Amendment,\" to limit debit card swipe fees charged by banks with assets over $10 billion. Studies show that fees associated with traditional bank accounts may limit interaction with the banking system. Proponents of cryptocurrencies argue that using them for payments could reduce costs and eliminate the need for fees altogether. Traditional payment systems require trust in government and financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies could be a desirable alternative for individuals who mistrust traditional payment systems due to concerns about the credibility of government and financial institutions. Countries with a higher degree of mistrust may see more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies compared to countries with generally high trust in existing systems. Individuals may mistrust traditional financial institutions due to concerns about security, privacy, and government stability of fiat currency. This leads some to opt for cryptocurrency for greater control over personal data and value stability. Some individuals may choose cryptocurrency over traditional systems due to mistrust in government's ability to maintain stable fiat currency value. Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized networks with cryptographic protocols to limit new money creation, offering potential benefits if widely adopted as a form of money. The value and usefulness of cryptocurrencies depend on network effects, where their acceptance as payment by people and businesses is crucial. Cryptocurrencies face challenges to widespread adoption due to limited usage as a medium of exchange. Only a small number of businesses and individuals currently use or accept cryptocurrency for payment, with a significant portion of transactions involving Bitcoin being for investment purposes rather than for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in being widely adopted as a medium of exchange due to various reasons. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, making creditors not obligated to accept them. Consumers and businesses may be hesitant to trust decentralized networks they don't fully understand. High volatility in cryptocurrency prices hinders their use as a unit of account and store of value. Bitcoin, for example, lost almost 53% of its value in the first half of 2018, equivalent to a 346% annualized inflation rate. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin face challenges in being widely adopted as a medium of exchange due to various reasons. The technology and systems underlying cryptocurrencies may not be scalable enough to handle the number of transactions required for a global payment system. Bitcoin's processing speed is slow compared to traditional electronic payment methods, with transactions taking 10 minutes to be added to the ledger. The slow processing speed of certain cryptocurrency transactions is due to the large computational resources involved in mining. As cryptocurrency prices have decreased, fewer miners participate in validating transactions, leading to reduced energy consumption in mining operations. The energy consumption required for cryptocurrency mining has decreased as fewer miners participate due to reduced rewards. This high energy consumption raises concerns about efficiency and negative externalities. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible and involve trust unless done face-to-face. Cryptocurrency transactions involve trust unless done face-to-face, creating risks for both buyers and sellers. This risk could deter parties from using cryptocurrencies in transactions, hindering their ability to act as a medium of exchange. Companies offer cryptocurrency escrow services to mitigate these risks by holding the buyer's cryptocurrency until delivery is confirmed. Cryptocurrency escrow services hold buyer's cryptocurrency until delivery is confirmed, enabling trust in transactions. However, reliance on intermediaries reintroduces the need for trusted third parties, raising concerns about security and trustworthiness in cryptocurrency transactions. For cryptocurrencies to become widely accepted, new procedures and intermediaries must achieve a sufficient level of trust and efficiency among the public. Cryptocurrencies may require their own system of intermediaries to function as money, which raises questions about their original purpose. Existing financial laws and regulations may not adequately address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies, including the potential for criminal activity and lack of consumer protections. Criminals prefer cash for anonymity, and some fear that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions could be exploited by criminals. Some observers are concerned that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions may provide a means for criminals to hide their financial dealings. For example, Bitcoin was used on the illegal drug marketplace Silk Road, facilitating over 100,000 illegal drug sales. However, criminal use of cryptocurrency does not necessarily outweigh its benefits, as law enforcement can track transactions on the public ledger. The public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions can be helpful for law enforcement in tracking criminal finances by linking pseudonyms to real-life identities. Government authorities can regulate cryptocurrency exchanges to report suspicious activity, as explained by FinCEN's guidance on virtual currencies. The FinCEN guidelines classify exchangers and administrators of virtual currency as money services businesses subject to federal regulation. MSBs must register, report suspicious transactions, and maintain anti-money laundering programs. State laws also impose registration and anti-money laundering requirements on MSBs. Bills in the 115th Congress aim to investigate criminal use of cryptocurrencies and enhance government agencies' capabilities in addressing the issue. Government agencies in the 115th Congress have taken action to address the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. Bills such as H.R. 2433, H.R. 5036, H.R. 6069, and H.R. 6411 have been passed to develop assessments, establish task forces, provide rewards for information leading to convictions, and fund programs to detect terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies. The House passed H.R. 6411, amending FinCEN's duties to include virtual currencies. IRS treats virtual currencies as property, taxing gains. IRS sought info on Coinbase customers with capital gains from cryptocurrencies. Few 2017 tax filings reported gains from cryptocurrencies despite market activity. The lack of clarity on reporting gains from cryptocurrencies in tax filings has raised concerns about potential tax evasion. With limited data available, concerns arise that individuals may use cryptocurrencies to hide income from tax authorities. The IRS has started collecting customer information from cryptocurrency exchanges to address this issue. Additionally, moving money or assets through decentralized platforms could also be a way to evade financial sanctions. The Venezuelan government has launched a digital currency to evade U.S. sanctions, with Iran and Russia showing interest as well. Consumer protection laws apply to cryptocurrencies, but debate exists on their adequacy and burden. Concerns also arise regarding tax evasion and hiding income through cryptocurrencies. The use of cryptocurrencies as investment vehicles raises concerns about investor protection and risk awareness. While federal consumer protection laws do not specifically target cryptocurrencies, the way they are sold or marketed can subject related businesses to consumer protection laws. For more detailed examinations of these issues, refer to CRS Report R45221 and CRS Report R45301. Cryptocurrency businesses are subject to consumer protection laws such as the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The FTC has taken enforcement actions against cryptocurrency promoters for potential violations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authority to enforce laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the financial industry, which could potentially apply to cryptocurrency exchanges. Although the CFPB has not actively regulated the cryptocurrency industry, it is accepting complaints and has indicated it would enforce consumer financial laws. The FTC and CFPB are actively involved in regulating the cryptocurrency industry, accepting complaints and enforcing consumer financial laws. State regulators also have enforcement authorities against deceptive practices in cryptocurrency businesses, with additional consumer protections through money transmission laws and licensing requirements. Money transmitters, including cryptocurrency exchanges, must obtain state licenses and adhere to regulatory regimes to safeguard customer investments. Consumers in cryptocurrency transactions may face risks such as excessive fees, deception about value, and loss of access due to irreversibility of transfers. Federal laws offer some protection, but not all regulations apply to cryptocurrency transactions. Some laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in cryptocurrency transactions may not apply, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978. State laws and consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions vary, potentially leaving consumers in states with lax regulation inadequately protected. The variation in consumer protection regulation across states may leave consumers inadequately protected. Policy options could include extending electronic fund transfer protections to cryptocurrency exchanges and granting federal agencies more regulatory authority. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that state regulations designed for traditional money transmission transactions are unnecessarily burdensome for cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrency advocates argue that current regulations for traditional money transmitters are burdensome for cryptocurrency exchanges. They suggest that the US risks falling behind in cryptocurrency development if regulatory burdens are not reduced. One proposed solution is enacting federal laws that preempt state requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. In the US, the Federal Reserve oversees monetary policy to maintain price stability and low unemployment. The Federal Reserve in the United States conducts monetary policy to achieve price stability and low unemployment. Central banks of other countries have similar goals. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could impact the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy. Some suggest central banks should issue their own digital currencies. Central banks regulate the amount of money in circulation to implement monetary policy. If cryptocurrencies become prevalent, governments may lose control over circulation. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could limit central banks' control over inflation and monetary policy. Central banks may need to make larger adjustments to fiat currency or start buying and selling cryptocurrencies themselves. Global circulation of cryptocurrency could lead to destabilizing effects on economies, impacting price stability and causing recessions or overheating in different countries. The global circulation of cryptocurrencies could limit central banks' control over inflation and monetary policy, leading to destabilizing effects on economies. Multiple currencies in an economy add complexity to exchanges, as seen in historical examples like the United States before the Civil War. Calls for a uniform currency arose due to the inefficiency and costs of tracking exchange rates and multiple prices. The establishment of a uniform currency was prompted by the inefficiency of managing exchange rates and multiple prices in various currencies. While governments have generally not been directly involved in creating cryptocurrencies, there is speculation about central banks issuing their own digital currencies for more efficient payment systems. The potential introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is being considered by some central banks. The form and features of CBDCs are uncertain, with discussions on the benefits and challenges they may bring, including potential efficiency gains in payment systems. Some argue that CBDCs could leverage cryptocurrency technologies for a faster and cheaper government-supported payment system. Cryptocurrencies could be used to create a faster, cheaper government-supported payment system through Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Advocates believe that CBDCs could increase systemic stability by allowing individuals to hold accounts directly at the central bank. Critics argue that there is no compelling need for CBDCs as existing electronic payment systems are already efficient. They also raise concerns about the potential impact on bank lending and the central bank's role in lending. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could lead to a shift of deposits from private banks to government-backed assets, potentially reducing private banks' lending capacity. Critics argue that CBDCs may destabilize the financial system by enabling runs on private banks. There is also debate on whether CBDCs would enhance central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could potentially reduce private banks' lending capacity by shifting deposits to government-backed assets. Critics argue that CBDCs may destabilize the financial system by enabling runs on private banks and expanding the central bank's role in private financial markets. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies remain uncertain due to unanswered questions about their ability. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies are uncertain due to unanswered questions about their ability to effectively serve as money and displace existing payment systems. Proponents believe cryptocurrencies will provide increased economic efficiency, privacy, and independence, while skeptics doubt their ability to become widely used forms of money. Policymakers may face issues related to cryptocurrency, including concerns about crime facilitation, consumer protections, industry regulation, and its impact on monetary policy."
