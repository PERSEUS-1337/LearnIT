    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and State Department on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has made changes using executive authority but may need congressional action for further adjustments. Congress may consider reassessing its role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration changed U.S. policy towards Burma in 2009, maintaining sanctions but adding elements like direct dialogue with the ruling military junta and cooperation on international security issues. The goal remained to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma. The Obama Administration changed U.S. policy towards Burma in 2009 to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma. The administration pressed Burma's military leaders to release political prisoners, end conflicts with ethnic minorities, and initiate political dialogue. The SPDC held parliamentary elections in 2010, leading to Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest. The SPDC transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, led by President Thein Sein, a former general. The new government has implemented political and economic reforms, releasing political prisoners and amending oppressive laws. In 2012, parliamentary by-elections were held, with Aung San Suu Kyi's party winning the majority of seats. Despite flaws in the election process, the results were accepted by the administration and military. The by-elections in Burma in 2012 saw Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the NLD, winning 43 out of 46 seats. Despite flaws in the process, the results were accepted by the Thein Sein administration and the military. The Obama Administration responded by increasing high-level meetings, easing sanctions, appointing a new ambassador, and increasing assistance to Burma. Plans are in place to reopen the USAID mission in Burma after 23 years. Plans are underway to increase U.S. assistance to Burma, including reopening the USAID mission after a 23-year hiatus. Despite reforms, the political and economic situation in Burma remains serious, with ongoing fighting between the military and ethnic-based militias. Human rights violations are reported in conflict areas, particularly in Kachin State. Ethnic tensions have been exposed in Rakhine State. While some laws have been passed to protect civil liberties, oppressive laws still exist. The NLD was able to compete in the 2012 by-elections, but other political parties have faced restrictions. The NLD was able to register and compete in the April 2012 by-elections, but several other political parties have not been allowed to register due to members in detention. Despite prisoner releases, over 200 political prisoners are still held in Burma. The 113th Congress may consider issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including the government's commitment to democracy and human rights, ability to implement reforms, and collaboration with Parliament and military for reform. US policy towards Burma may need to broaden beyond current key figures to include ethnic minorities and their organizations. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma focuses on relations with ethnic minorities and their organizations, easing sanctions, aid provision, and alignment with the Asia-Pacific region. The origins of this policy can be traced back to a 2007 article by Michael Green and Derek Mitchell. Green and Mitchell recommended changes in U.S. policy towards Burma, emphasizing the need for political and economic reforms. The Obama Administration initially expressed skepticism towards Burma's government but later evolved its approach, engaging with the military regime while maintaining sanctions. Relations with ethnic groups and opposition parties were also prioritized. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma shifted over time, with a focus on promoting progressive forces within President Thein Sein's government. This led to closer ties between the two governments, possibly at the expense of relations with opposition parties and ethnic groups. The U.S. now speaks of a partnership with Thein Sein's government, isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations. This realignment may have strained relations with traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Burma, focusing on promoting reforms and fostering further changes in the country. This new strategy includes closer ties with President Thein Sein's government and aims to create an environment conducive to more reforms. There is debate among experts and interest groups about the pace and extent of these changes, with some concerned about moving too fast and others worried about the remaining sanctions hindering progress. The Obama Administration announced a new Burma policy, maintaining existing sanctions until concrete progress is seen towards reform. They also reserved the right to impose additional sanctions if needed, or relax them based on the political situation in Burma. The Obama Administration's new Burma policy maintains existing sanctions until concrete progress is made towards reform, with the possibility of imposing additional sanctions or relaxing them based on the political situation in Burma. The tense political situation in Burma in 2010 led to the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotting the November elections due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into the USDP, with Prime Minister Thein Sein as its leader, and announced the transformation of ethnic militias into Border Guard Forces under the Burmese military's command. In 2009, the refusal of ethnic militias to join the Border Guard Forces led to military offensives and refugee crises. Conflict erupted between the Burmese military and various ethnic militias, with reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea causing concern. U.S. naval vessels monitored a cargo ship carrying arms from North Korea to Burma in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) warned in 2010 that Burma was exploring nuclear weapons development, with claims of receiving support from North Korea. Concerns over arms trade violations under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 prompted cautious response from the Obama Administration. President Obama criticized Burma's flawed elections in November 2010. The elections in Burma were flawed, with over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, being detained. The regime silenced the National League for Democracy and hindered opposition candidates. The United States will continue pressure on Burma to release political prisoners and uphold human rights. The United States urges Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, recognize democratic parties, and engage in inclusive dialogue for reconciliation. The flawed electoral process allowed military figures to dominate decision-making despite wearing civilian clothes. The cautious approach continued after the establishment of the Thein Sein administration. The cautious approach to Burma continued after the establishment of the Thein Sein administration. Steps were taken in Washington to respond to significant developments in Burma, including the appointment of Derek Mitchell as the first Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. Mitchell's role, created by the JADE Act, involves coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma and consulting with foreign governments and Congress. Burma's new government saw a mix of positive and negative developments, such as the commutation of death sentences to life in prison. Burma's new government under President Thein Sein showed both positive and negative developments. Death sentences were commuted to life in prison, leading to the release of 14,578 individuals, including political prisoners. The government also reached out to Aung San Suu Kyi and ethnic organizations for political reconciliation. However, tensions rose when a Navy destroyer intercepted a cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology from North Korea to Burma. Additionally, the Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to increased fighting in northern Burma. Former Assistant Secretary Campbell and Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government in 2011. They disagreed with the government's claims of progress towards democracy, citing concerns about former military officials holding key positions. Ambassador Mitchell's visit in September did not indicate immediate policy changes or progress on core issues. Ambassador Mitchell's visit to Burma in September 2011 included meetings with key leaders and discussions on human rights abuses, conflicts with ethnic militias, and relations with North Korea. President Thein Sein's announcement of willingness to negotiate ceasefire agreements was seen as a positive step towards future bilateral relations. This visit set the stage for Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin's visit to the U.S. in late September. Additionally, President Thein Sein announced a large-scale prisoner pardon on October 11, 2011, releasing 6,359 individuals, including 241 political prisoners. President Thein Sein announced a large-scale prisoner pardon on October 11, 2011, releasing 6,359 individuals, including 241 political prisoners. Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Michael Posner visited Burma on November 1-2, 2011, to discuss political reform, ongoing fighting with ethnic militias, and human rights. President Obama expressed concerns about human rights in Burma on November 18, 2011, but acknowledged some progress. He then announced sending Secretary Clinton to explore further engagement with Burma. During her visit to Burma in late 2011, Secretary Clinton announced new U.S. development programs, including aid for victims of internal conflict and academic exchange programs. The Burmese government had shown progress in implementing political reforms and negotiating ceasefire agreements. Clinton's initiatives were permissible under U.S. sanctions in force at the time. In late 2011, the Burmese government implemented political reforms and negotiated ceasefire agreements. Key laws were passed to protect civil liberties, including the Labour Organization Law and the Law Relating to Peaceful Assembly. President Thein Sein lifted pre-publication censorship for certain topics but maintained post-publication censorship. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission was established to safeguard citizens' rights. Ceasefire talks with ethnic groups made progress, despite ongoing fighting in Kachin State. In early 2012, progress was made in ceasefire talks with ethnic groups in Burma, including agreements with the DKBA, NDAA, RCSS, and USWA. President Thein Sein granted prisoner pardons on two occasions, releasing a total of 6,656 prisoners, including political prisoners. President Obama waived a section of the TVPA regarding Burma, allowing for financial assistance through MDBs and the IMF. In April 2012, Burma held a parliamentary by-election with national and international interest due to Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD members running as candidates, despite the NLD boycotting the 2010 elections. The by-election did not fully meet UN standards. The April by-elections in Burma did not fully meet UN standards, but Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats. The Obama Administration and other countries congratulated Burma on the electoral process and removed sanctions. Former Secretary Clinton announced US support for reforms in Burma. On April 4, 2012, former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma following the by-elections. These steps were to be taken using existing executive authority and included relaxing restrictions on U.S. organizations providing nonprofit activities in Burma. OFAC approved a new general license on April 17, 2012, allowing financial services exportation to Burma for specific not-for-profit projects. Officials mentioned easing trade and investment restrictions in areas like agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications, but expressed caution in sectors like gems and timber. The plan is to implement the five steps using existing waiver authorities and executive orders. The plan to implement the five steps includes using existing waiver authorities and/or rescinding executive orders, with no current plan to involve Congress. Some steps require invoking presidential waiver authority in existing sanction laws and delivering a presidential determination to Congress. On May 16, 2012, Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, where the Obama Administration announced three significant policy developments towards Burma. The White House renewed the national emergency with respect to Burma, extended sanctions for another year, nominated Derek Mitchell as U.S. ambassador to Burma, and announced an easing of bans on financial services and new investment in Burma. Former Secretary Clinton provided details on the easing, promoting responsible investment and transparency in business practices. Administration officials shared more information on the planned easing of investment. The Obama Administration planned to ease sanctions on investment and financial services in Burma, allowing U.S. investors to invest in all sectors as long as the partner is not on the SDN list. The SDN list would be regularly updated to prevent \"bad actors\" from benefiting. Criteria for listing on the SDN would include evaluations of business practices and attitudes towards reforms in Burma. The State Department was consulting with various parties to develop voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies operating in Burma. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased sanctions on U.S. investments in Burma and financial services. Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions to target individuals threatening Burma's stability or involved in human rights abuses. The ban on new U.S. investments in Burma was lifted, along with the prohibition on exporting financial services. President Obama delegated authority to waive sanctions via a presidential memorandum. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on U.S. investments in Burma and financial services in 2012. Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions to target individuals threatening Burma's stability or involved in human rights abuses. President Obama delegated authority to waive sanctions via a presidential memorandum, allowing new investments in Burma with certain limitations. OFAC released General License No. 17, permitting new investments in Burma by U.S. persons, subject to restrictions on dealings with certain entities and compliance with State Department reporting requirements. The State Department's proposed reporting requirements for investments in Burma include reporting any investment involving the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) within 60 days and all investments over $500,000 annually by April 1. OFAC also introduced General License No. 16 allowing the exportation of financial services to Burma with restrictions. General License No. 16 supersedes General License No. 14-C and 15, allowing the provision of financial services to Burma with restrictions. President Obama imposed sanctions on certain Burmese nationals via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those involved in activities threatening Burma's peace or human rights abuses. The Obama Administration implemented policy changes in Burma in May 2012 amidst positive and negative developments. Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo resigned, ceasefire agreements with ethnic groups were made but progress stalled, and riots broke out in Rakhine State between Rohingyas and Rakhines. President Thein Sein reorganized his negotiating team, excluding Aung Thaung. Burma's censorship board warned publications. In response to riots between Rohingyas and Rakhines in Rakhine State, Burma's censorship board warned publications and blocked reports of Tin Aung Myint Oo's resignation. Over 100,000 people were displaced by the civil unrest. Despite this, President Thein Sein made progress with political rights and economic reform, pardoning 80 prisoners, ending pre-publication censorship, and implementing a unified managed float system for exchange rates. In August 2012, President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet. In August 2012, President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet, bringing in close advisors to consolidate his political power. The move was seen as an attempt to purge resistors to reforms and sparked a debate over the oversight authority of the Union Parliament. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled that parliamentary bodies did not have the authority to compel ministerial officials to testify, leading to protests by the Union Parliament. The Tribunal's decision in August 2012 led to protests by the Union Parliament and calls for impeachment of tribunal members. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma, removing two Burmese officials from the list of Specially Designated Nationals. H.R. 6431 was passed into law, granting the President authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma.

The mission is developing programs covering democracy, human rights, transparent governance, peace, food security, and health. President Obama delegated authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma to Secretary Clinton via a presidential memorandum. Clinton determined it was in the national interest to support assistance for Burma, effectively waiving the requirement to oppose IFI assistance. The World Bank approved an $80 million grant for community-driven development in Burma with U.S. support. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner led a U.S. delegation for a human rights dialogue in Naypyidaw. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner led a U.S. delegation to Burma for a bilateral human rights dialogue, covering topics like rule of law and military code of conduct. Burma was invited to attend the Cobra Gold military training exercise, and President Obama planned to visit Burma during his trip to Southeast Asia. President Obama's upcoming visit to Burma in November 2012 marks the first by a sitting U.S. President. The visit includes meetings with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, along with a speech on political reform. The U.S. has acknowledged progress in Burma towards democracy and has taken steps to support further reforms, despite challenges such as ethnic unrest and the need for justice system development. Power recognized the challenges faced by Burma, including ethnic unrest, ongoing conflicts, justice system development, free press cultivation, and civil society formation. President Obama's upcoming trip was expected to focus on prisoners of conscience, political reforms, rule of law, and peace and reconciliation. National Security Advisor Donilon highlighted the endorsement of reforms in Burma by President Obama's visit, with the State Department waiving the ban on imports from Burma in the national interest. President Obama's visit to Burma in 2012 included meetings with key leaders, a public speech at the University of Yangon, and discussions on social issues in both countries. The choice of venue was politically significant due to its historical significance in Burma's anti-colonial movement and uprising against military rule. President Obama highlighted key social issues in Burma and the United States, emphasizing the importance of free expression, assembly, and press for democracy. He discussed the U.S. system of governance and the need for national reconciliation and an end to ethnic discrimination in Burma's reform process. Obama expressed confidence in Burma's progress despite challenges, offering U.S. partnership on the journey ahead. President Obama praised Burma's progress towards democracy during meetings with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi. He emphasized the need for continued political reforms and cooperation on non-proliferation issues. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed concerns openly but acknowledged the momentum for democratization. In Yangon, Aung San Suu Kyi and President Obama discussed various concerns openly, emphasizing the need to sustain democratization momentum. The Burmese government agreed to important actions, including compliance with U.N. sanctions on North Korea, allowing ICRC prisoner visits, reviewing cases of \"prisoners of concern,\" and committing to anti-trafficking and labor initiatives. They also pledged to join the Open Government Partnership by 2016. The Burmese government agreed to actions such as compliance with U.N. sanctions, allowing ICRC visits to prisoners, and committing to anti-trafficking initiatives. However, there were concerns about their commitment to political reform as violent incidents occurred, including police attacking a peaceful protest and military assaults on ethnic armed groups despite promises made to President Obama. President Thein Sein and the Union Parliament did take steps to protect assembly rights and freedom of the media. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA continued sporadically. The Burmese government took steps to protect assembly rights and freedom of the media. The Tatmadaw launched a major offensive against the KIA in Kachin State, violating ceasefire talks and drawing international criticism for human rights abuses and the use of child soldiers. The KIA in Kachin State faced allegations of using child soldiers, leading to international criticism. The U.S. Embassy urged both sides to establish dialogue for peace, but a ceasefire broke down as Tatmadaw forces attacked a KIA base. The Burmese Army's resumption of fighting in Kachin State was condemned by the U.S. Embassy. The United States expresses deep concern over ongoing violence in Burma's Kachin State despite a ceasefire announcement. The Burmese Army continues its offensive near the Kachin Independence Army headquarters, resulting in civilian casualties and hindering national reconciliation efforts. Negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA have taken place, but fighting persists, raising doubts about Tatmadaw's support for any agreements. The Union Government and Parliament in Burma made policy changes in early 2013 to improve civil liberties, including dissolving the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division and abolishing a military junta order restricting gatherings. Additionally, a draft media legislation was forwarded to the Union Parliament by the Ministry of Information. The Ministry of Information in Burma forwarded a draft media legislation to the Union Parliament on March 4, 2013, replacing the 1962 Printer and Publishers Registration Act. The bill was criticized for being more restrictive than the previous law, violating an agreement with the Myanmar Press Council. The draft law prohibits publishing articles on ethnic conflicts, criticizing the 2008 constitution, or \"disturbing the rule of law.\" The draft media legislation in Burma, criticized for being more restrictive than the previous law, establishes a MOI-appointed \"registration official\" with censorship powers. The proposed penalties include imprisonment and fines, more severe than the 1962 law. OFAC issued general license No. 19 on February 22, 2013, waiving restrictions on financial transactions with four Burmese banks to facilitate U.S. companies and NGOs operating in Burma. The easing of U.S. economic sanctions on Burma in July 2012 allowed transactions with four of Burma's larger banks, despite criticism that they are owned by \"cronies\" with close ties to the military. The Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma was reflected in the statements of Assistant Secretary of State Michael H. Posner and Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy during a hearing on human rights in Burma. Special Representative Murphy highlighted President Thein Sein's reform agenda and emphasized the new era of relations between the United States and Burma. The U.S. Government, in partnership with Congress, has responded to reforms in Burma to encourage further progress. Assistant Secretary Posner stated the United States seeks to support Burma as it undergoes change. The Obama Administration takes credit for changes in Burma since announcing its new policy, but the political situation remains fragile. The SPDC in Burma announced a roadmap for a \"disciplined democracy\" with steps towards political reforms. President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process but lacks clarity on the vision for a democratic Burma. Key debates include civilian control over the military and the Tatmadaw's special powers. Key debates in Burma include civilian control over the military, the balance of power between branches of government, citizenship conditions, and the removal of restrictions on civil liberties. The military's influence and opacity remain significant concerns. The Burmese military, led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, is a powerful and opaque institution in Burma. The relationship between the military and the Union Government is unclear, with many cabinet ministers being current or former military officers. The Tatmadaw's support for political reform and the government appears limited. The Tatmadaw's support for political reform and the Union Government may be limited, as Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing has not publicly confirmed ordering his troops to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite presidential instructions. The reassignment of top military personnel and replacement of appointed members of the Union Parliament suggest potential political intentions and efforts to tighten discipline within the military's selected representatives. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament are strained, with tensions highlighted during the February 2013 session. During the February 2013 session, the Union Parliament questioned the military budget size, and a commission reported land seizures by the Tatmadaw. The military's economic influence and ownership in key sectors remain unresolved in a reformed Burma. The military in Burma owns key economic sectors such as oil, gas, and timber through entities like UMEHL and MEC, providing independent revenue and control over the economy. The Tatmadaw's corporate assets give them financial autonomy, while ongoing civil war stems from ethnic minorities feeling the government failed to grant autonomy as per the Panglong Agreement. The Tatmadaw in Burma maintains control over key economic sectors like oil, gas, and timber through entities like UMEHL and MEC, providing financial autonomy. The ongoing civil war is rooted in ethnic minorities' dissatisfaction with the government's failure to grant autonomy as per the Panglong Agreement. The Burmese military is designated as the main entity for safeguarding national integrity and sovereignty, with a proposed three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the conflict and achieve reconciliation with ethnic organizations. The Union Government in Burma has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate agreements with ethnic organizations and amend the 2008 Constitution. The process involves disbanding ethnic militias or merging them into the Tatmadaw. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is a key negotiator, but some prominent ethnic organizations have rejected the proposal. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) proposes direct negotiations with the Union Government for national reconciliation, leading to a national conference and convention to establish a federal union of Burma. Talks with ethnic organizations have had mixed results, with preliminary ceasefire agreements reached with some groups but not the KIO/KIA. Negotiations have not completed the Union Government's three-step peace process. The negotiations for national reconciliation in Burma have not progressed to the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Key unresolved issues include the distribution of powers between the central government and ethnic States, the Tatmadaw's support for any agreement, and the negotiation process itself. The Burmese military's lack of participation and attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about the peace process. The peace committee is advocating for national reconciliation in Burma, but there are disagreements on the negotiation process. The Union Government wants to incorporate ethnic groups into the current governance system through the 2008 Constitution, but many ethnic organizations do not accept this approach. The legitimacy of the Constitution is a critical issue for national reconciliation, as it was drafted without input from opposition parties and ethnic organizations, seen as favoring the Burmese military. The 2008 Constitution in Burma, drafted by the SPDC to maintain military power, is criticized for limited public access and fraudulent referendum results. The parliamentary elections in 2010 were deemed unfair, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Union Government. President Thein Sein is open to minor amendments to the constitution, including potential changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, seek significant alterations to the constitution. The opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, want amendments to the 2008 Constitution, particularly to allow her to serve as President after the 2015 elections. While some are willing to follow the constitution's amendment process, many ethnic organizations reject the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the government and military for a new constitution. The requirements for amending the constitution may hinder any negotiated agreement. The 2008 Constitution outlines the arduous process for amending it, requiring support from 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Certain sections, like government structure and military involvement, also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. The 2008 Constitution sets strict requirements for amending it, including support from military appointees and approval from over 50% of eligible voters. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during this potential political transition. The Obama Administration's handling of Burma relations has faced criticism for moving too fast or too slowly in relaxing sanctions. Congress has passed laws and introduced bills related to Burma, with some hearings focused on U.S. policy in Burma. The 113th Congress may have a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during a potential political transition. Three of the five new laws extended the import ban from the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, while two other laws pertained to the use of funds and international financial institutions providing assistance to Burma. Prohibitions were placed on the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma. Section 7014 of Division I of P.L. 112-74 banned the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma. P.L. 112-192 granted the Secretary of the Treasury the option to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at international financial institutions to provide assistance for Burma if deemed in the national interest, with notification to relevant committees. During the 112th Congress, various bills related to Burma were introduced, with only a few becoming law. Congressional hearings on Burma were evenly split between the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Additionally, H.Con.Res. 135 authorized the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. During the 112th Congress, hearings on Burma were split between the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The Senate held hearings on the implementation of the Tibetan Policy Act, Block Burmese JADE Act, and North Korean Human Rights Act. Nomination hearings for Derek J. Mitchell were also conducted for the positions of Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma and Ambassador to Burma. The 113th Congress may consider various aspects of U.S. policy towards Burma. Congress may investigate the Obama Administration's approach to relations with Burma, assess implementation of existing laws, and adjust U.S. policy as needed. Oversight includes examining funding requests for assistance programs in Burma. The House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs may hold hearings or request information on U.S. policy towards Burma in the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress may consider examining the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, assessing the implementation of existing laws, and potentially adjusting U.S. policy towards Burma. Key aspects for consideration include the political situation in Burma, the pace of easing sanctions, and the focus on President Thein Sein and other Burmese officials. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma is being questioned, particularly regarding its focus on President Thein Sein and the Union Government. There are concerns about damaging relations with the Union Parliament, opposition parties, and ethnic organizations. The U.S. government's stance on the legitimacy of the Union Government, the 2008 Constitution, and the need for a proactive or reactive approach towards fostering reforms in Burma is also being scrutinized. Additionally, there are questions about the U.S. Government's assessment of the Burmese military's stance on political reform, the best approach to dealing with them, and the potential reestablishment of military-to-military relations. The Obama Administration's views on ethnic groups and militias, as well as the possibility of establishing closer relations with ethnic organizations, are also under consideration. The U.S. Government is facing questions about its approach to Burma, including its focus on President Thein Sein and the Union Government. Concerns also exist about damaging relations with the Union Parliament, opposition parties, and ethnic organizations. Specific issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma include the appointment of a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator, administration of lists for sanctions, and submission of required reports to Congress. The 2008 JADE Act mandates the appointment of a Special Representative with ambassador rank. The Special Representative for Burma, appointed with ambassador rank, cannot hold another executive branch position except for the U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell served in this role until becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma in 2012. Deputy Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy then took over temporarily. The Federal Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments for Senate-confirmed positions for up to 210 days. The Federal Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments for Senate-confirmed positions for up to 210 days. Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit, prompting Congress to inquire about the Obama Administration's nomination intentions. Implementation issues include compiling lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under existing laws. The Federal Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments for Senate-confirmed positions for up to 210 days. Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit, prompting Congress to inquire about the Obama Administration's nomination intentions. Various presidential determinations and executive orders prohibit the issuance of entry visas to selected Burmese nationals, with the Department of State responsible for maintaining the list. The 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act freeze assets of certain Burmese persons held by a U.S. person or entering the United States, with financial sanctions to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act requires the Secretaries of State and the Treasury to allocate resources for identifying potential persons for sanctions. Human rights groups criticize the State and Treasury Departments for not fully enforcing visa bans and financial sanctions. The State Department has not disclosed the names on its visa ban list, making compliance unclear. Burmese officials have visited the U.S., potentially violating sanctions laws. The Treasury Department delegates maintaining the list of sanctioned Burmese persons to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for maintaining the list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions. The current Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list does not include all individuals and companies that should be sanctioned according to relevant laws. Congressionally mandated reports on Burmese sanctions have not been delivered to Congress on time, including reports on global military assistance to Burma and foreign banking institutions holding Burmese assets. The existing sanctions on Burma are still in effect, with the general import ban subject to annual renewal by Congress. President Obama has waived some sanctions, but the authority to impose them remains. The current extension of the import ban ends on July 25, 2013, with a waiver in the national interest. The 113th Congress may decide on extending the import ban. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban on Burma, altering U.S. policy towards Burma, imposing or re-imposing sanctions, clarifying conditions for sanction termination, providing guidance on policy conduct, and funding levels for assistance programs proposed by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration proposed various assistance programs in Burma, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, and democracy initiatives. Funding for these programs may be affected by budget constraints, such as sequestration. The reopening of the USAID mission in Rangoon will require additional federal funding. The Obama Administration proposed assistance programs in Burma, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, and democracy initiatives. Sequestration may affect funding for these programs. The Department of State and USAID have the authority to reprogram funds. Post-sequestration funding levels for Burma are uncertain. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future choices. The 113th Congress may play an active role in shaping Burma's path. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future choices, and the 113th Congress may play an active role in shaping Burma's path towards a civilian democratic government. Appendices provide maps, chronology of events, and required reports to Congress on Burma. The curr_chunk discusses the details of required reports to Congress on Burma, including the relevant law, responsible agencies, recipients, reporting frequency, deadline, and delivery method."
