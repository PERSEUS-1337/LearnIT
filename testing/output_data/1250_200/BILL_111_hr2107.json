    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on findings, public education campaign, patient informed consent, duty of professionals to disclose information to pregnant patients, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Approximately 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been successfully used in treating these conditions, with over 14,000 transplants performed globally in the last 20 years. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, especially for children. They result in lower rates of graft versus host disease and are easier to match based on HLA typing. Cord blood cells have been effective in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells and are pluripotent, able to differentiate into every cell type in the human body. Cord blood cells are pluripotent, able to differentiate into any cell type in the body. Research is ongoing for using these cells to treat various conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and hearing loss. Despite their potential, over 90% of cord blood cells are discarded as medical waste in the US. The Institute recommended clear information and balanced perspectives for cord blood cell donors, emphasizing informed consent before labor and delivery. SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will include information on the value and uses of cord blood, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, public vs. private cord blood banking, and options for mothers regarding stem cells in cord blood after delivery. The options for a mother regarding umbilical cord blood stem cells after delivery include donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, storing for family members in need, or discarding. The process of collecting cord blood and medical/family history criteria impacting cord blood banking decisions are also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the options for ownership and future use of donated umbilical cord blood, the average cost of public and private umbilical cord blood banking, the availability of public and private cord blood banks, and the racial and ethnic groups in particular need of publicly donated cord blood samples. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, the medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals are required to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained or documented at least 2 weeks before delivery. Medicaid regulations will be amended to accommodate these requirements. Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with certain requirements and have a method to enforce them. Section 1903 is also amended to address non-compliance by states. The Social Security Act is amended to require healthcare professionals to comply with prenatal care requirements for pregnant women. Non-compliance by states may result in payment reductions. Additionally, employer group health plans must inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. The Social Security Act now mandates healthcare professionals providing prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with specific requirements. Employer group health plans must also inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. The amendments made by this subsection apply to physicians and other healthcare professionals for agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will develop professional educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Grants may be provided for targeted education on cord blood stem cells to various groups, including health care providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
