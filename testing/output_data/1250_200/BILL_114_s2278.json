The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as appropriate committees of Congress, Assistant Secretary, Commission, Federal entity, Spectrum Relocation Fund, and unlicensed operations. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" allows spectrum use without protection from interference under specific regulations. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" allows spectrum use without protection from interference under specific regulations. Federal Communications Commission is responsible for the allocation and allotment of spectrum. The Commission must ensure a balance between exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established for future allocation, including potential unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. These rules must be included in auction service rules and reflected in reports to Congress. The National Strategy for Unlicensed Spectrum is outlined in Section 4 of the Act, which aims to establish rules for future allocation of spectrum, including potential unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. The policy of the United States is to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission must develop a national strategy within a year to make more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for such use and considering spectrum sharing rules. The FCC is considering rules to permit spectrum sharing for unlicensed operations, including expanding utilization of the spectrum sharing model and allowing underlay unlicensed operations in allocated spectrum. They are also examining ways to improve databases and systems for promoting spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations. The FCC will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of enacting the Act, detailing the strategy for promoting spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, along with any legislative recommendations. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations include reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs related to sharing bands with unlicensed technologies and ensuring the fund's solvency. Consideration is given to permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without interference. The report to Congress will assess the feasibility of allowing unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference, including impacts on homeland security or national security communications. It will also explore alternative spectrum sharing techniques for radio technologies accessing Federal spectrum."
