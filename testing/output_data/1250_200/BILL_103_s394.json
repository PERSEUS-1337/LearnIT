    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a 50 percent credit for qualified cooperative research expenditures. Qualified cooperative research expenditures are defined as contributions to research consortia for qualified research. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a 50 percent credit for qualified cooperative research expenditures, which are contributions to research consortia for qualified research. Qualified contributions to these consortia are subject to limitations based on private source funding ratios. The private source funding ratio for qualified contributions is calculated as 50% of the organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable year, 30% for the second preceding year, and 20% for the third preceding year. Contributions representing costs allocated to services performed by a taxpayer are not considered qualified contributions. Contributions exceeding cash contributions and overhead allocated to services by taxpayer's employees are not considered qualified contributions. Contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium exceeding one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support may qualify. If a consortium has fewer than 5 participants, specific rules apply. If a qualified cooperative research consortium has less than 5 persons making nongovernmental contributions, the qualified contributions of each person shall be reduced by 20 percent if there are 4 such persons, or by 40 percent if there are 3 such persons. A qualified cooperative research consortium is an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 with at least 5 contributors during the taxable year. A qualified cooperative research consortium must have at least 5 contributors during the taxable year. If there are 5 contributors, no 3 members can contribute more than 80% or a single member more than 50% of total nongovernmental contributions. If there are 3 or 4 contributors, no single member can contribute more than 50% (and no 2 members more than 85%) of total nongovernmental contributions, and all contributors must be engaged in the same trade or business. For qualified cooperative research consortia, noncash contributions, including services by employees, are considered at cost. Overhead costs for employee services are included. Contributions for future research are treated as paid in the period conducted. Amounts used for qualified research expenditures cannot be double-counted. Qualified cooperative research consortia must provide a report to the Secretary with certification, private funding ratio, and other required information. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment date."
