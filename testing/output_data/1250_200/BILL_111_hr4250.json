    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Medicaid DSH Integrity Act\" recognizes the importance of Medicaid DSH payments for safety net hospitals serving low-income individuals. The Act emphasizes the need for reporting and auditing requirements to ensure proper use of DSH funds. Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations have been implemented to fulfill the intended purpose of assisting hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income individuals. The DSH policy changes implemented by Congress aim to narrow the scope of DSH payments, potentially reducing funding for safety net providers participating in the Medicaid DSH program. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce policy changes related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes such as allowing hospitals to include all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, regardless of other insurance coverage, and permitting states to use their own definition of allowable costs in Medicaid plans. CMS will interpret the audit requirement language in the Social Security Act to align with the term \"hospital services\" and not impose a more restrictive interpretation. Additionally, CMS will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol to allow for the use of different cost-to-charge ratios and amend regulations to permit alternative methods. CMS will revise regulations to allow alternative methodologies for determining actual costs, including trending forward costs from prior years. The Social Security Act will be amended to change the initiation requirements, and definitions for terms like \"CMS\" and \"Medicaid DSH program\" are provided. The term \"Medicaid DSH program\" refers to payment adjustments under section 1923 of the Social Security Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through CMS."
