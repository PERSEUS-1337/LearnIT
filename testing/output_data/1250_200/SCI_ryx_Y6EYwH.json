A differentially private estimator is proposed to protect sensitive patient data. The method extends to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. Empirical evidence from clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. An example illustrates how published survival function estimates can lead to user-level data reconstruction by adversaries. The survival function is a crucial tool used in various domains, including healthcare, where the leakage of sensitive information poses a serious threat. Estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method is common in clinical research, with significant implications for privacy. Adversaries can reconstruct user-level data from published survival function estimates, highlighting the need for robust privacy protection measures. The Kaplan-Meier method is widely used in clinical research for reporting survival statistics. While there are no formal privacy guarantees for estimating survival functions using this method, some related work exists. Differentially private generative models could potentially be used to estimate survival functions in a privacy-preserving manner. The proposed method guarantees differentially private estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without additional privacy cost. It extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation using real-life clinical datasets. The survival function is essential for modeling time to event data, accounting for censored observations where the event has not yet occurred. The proposed method ensures privacy in estimating survival functions and extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation using real-life clinical datasets. The survival function is crucial for modeling time to event data, considering censored observations. Various methods can estimate the survival function, including parametric and non-parametric approaches like the Kaplan-Meier method. The KM estimator defines the survival function based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time point. Differential privacy offers a provable privacy notion in this context. Differential privacy ensures privacy in survival function estimation by providing provable privacy guarantees through a randomized algorithm. It is immune to post-processing, as stated in Theorem 1. Our approach ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It allows for estimating various statistics in a private manner without using extra privacy budget. Our approach ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It allows for estimating various statistics privately without using extra privacy budget. The method involves creating a dataset matrix M with event and at-risk data for each time point, adding noise from a Laplace distribution to create a differentially private version of M. This process is succinctly presented in Algorithm 1, highlighting the simplicity of the procedure for achieving differential privacy. The original estimation procedure was modified to achieve differential privacy without computational overhead. The method guarantees privacy and can be easily extended for other statistics. The L1 sensitivity of the algorithm is two, ensuring privacy, and it is -differentially private. The algorithm ensures differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to the components, making it -differentially private. The approach can be easily extended to include other essential statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics for group comparison. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, ensuring differential privacy by adding Laplace noise. The most commonly used Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals are discussed, with the calculations proven to be -differentially private. Greenwood's formula for confidence intervals is adapted to be differentially private by using Algorithm 1. This ensures that confidence intervals are also differentially private without needing access to sensitive data. Additionally, hypothesis testing using the Logrank test can be made differentially private using Algorithm 6. The Logrank test for hypothesis testing is made -differentially private by replacing sensitive data with their private counterparts using Algorithm 1. This ensures that the test statistic and confidence intervals can be output without using additional privacy budget. Competing events in clinical data, such as death before progression to AIDS, require specialized estimates like competing risk cumulative incidence. This estimate, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator, can be made -differentially private using Algorithm 1. The differentially private extension of the Kaplan-Meier estimator at time t (i) is discussed, along with its implications for statistics like confidence intervals and hazard ratios. Additionally, a differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is presented. The method is evaluated on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. The study evaluates a method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function using nine real-life clinical datasets. The results show that the privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the non-private version, indicating high utility and credibility for practical use.

Results show that the privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the non-private version, indicating high utility and credibility for practical use. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget, especially in small sample sized datasets. The study evaluates differentially private estimation of the survival function using real-life clinical datasets. Results show that the privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the non-private version, indicating high utility and credibility for practical use. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget, especially in small sample sized datasets. In a small dataset, large noise is needed for privacy, while moderate to medium-sized datasets show good results with differentially private estimation. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival function. The method estimates the median with high precision, even in the high privacy regime. Some cases with high survival may not have upper bounds on confidence intervals. Precision increases with dataset size, showing a trade-off for individual-level privacy protection. The differentially private estimation performs similarly to the original non-noisy estimation. Our differentially private estimation closely matches the original non-noisy estimation, even in the high privacy regime. The test statistic follows a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom, maintaining statistical significance thresholds. Results for cumulative incidence using competing risk information are similar, showing good utility while protecting privacy. Further details are available in the Appendix. Several works have proposed differentially private methods for regression modeling and survival analysis. Differentially private generative models have also been developed, but they are not suitable for survival function estimation. A new method for differentially private estimation of the survival function has been presented, which can be extended to other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. Extensive empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method offers good privacy-utility trade-off for differentially private estimation of various statistics such as confidence intervals, test statistics, and cumulative incidence. Empirical evaluation on nine real-life datasets demonstrates its effectiveness. The datasets used for evaluation include cancer survival data, leukemia trial data, and kidney infection recurrence data. The dataset includes information on cancer survival, leukemia trials, and kidney infection recurrence. Time is converted into months, and groups compared are based on different treatment arms and age groups. The study compares treatment arms using two datasets with multiple event types: one from a PBC clinical trial and another from a liver transplant waiting list. The results show that the differentially private extension provides accurate estimation of the competing risk cumulative incidence function with strong privacy guarantees. Theorem 6 proves that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private. The study demonstrates accurate estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence with strong privacy guarantees using a differentially private extension. The method ensures privacy by utilizing sensitivity in function estimation."
