    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts and indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions through 2014, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. In the 114th Congress, debate focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. All expired tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, some provisions are still set to expire at the end of 2016, prompting further debate. The report provides an overview of tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 contained the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions. It also made enhancements to tax credits and included moratoriums on certain taxes. Additionally, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year. In the 113th Congress, legislation was considered to extend expiring tax provisions for one year. There were also proposals for a two-year extension and making certain provisions permanent. In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, including provisions from previous years. The term \"tax extender\" refers to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress, often for short periods. The number of tax provisions considered \"tax extenders\" has grown as new temporary provisions are routinely added to the package. Congress enacts temporary tax provisions for various reasons such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. However, the rationale for temporary provisions is undermined if they are regularly extended without systematic review. The rationale for enacting temporary tax provisions is undermined if expiring provisions are regularly extended without systematic review. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted the importance of expiration dates to force policymakers to evaluate the costs and benefits of special tax treatment. However, in practice, there is a lack of systematic review, and extenders are typically passed as a package without individual analysis. While most expiring tax provisions are extended, there have been exceptions like tax incentives for ethanol fuels not being extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits. The Government Accountability Office found that tax credits for ethanol were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if benefits do not exceed costs. Tax policy can address temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Temporary provisions enacted for special economic circumstances should be allowed to expire once the situation is resolved. The Section 1603 grants and temporary tax policies are designed to address specific situations and may expire once resolved. Temporary tax cuts are easier to offset in the short term than long-term extensions, impacting the Congressional Budget Office's revenue projections. By making tax provisions temporary, the long-term fiscal outlook is less affected, as they are considered federal subsidies favoring certain activities. Extenders influence economic resource allocation. Temporary tax benefits, known as extenders, can impact economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity is crucial for policymakers. Extenders aim to encourage specific activities and may improve economic welfare by addressing market failures. The effectiveness of extenders depends on whether they remedy distortions in the market. Tax extenders can impact economic welfare by addressing market failures. They are considered effective if they stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies. However, direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Tax fairness is important, with extenders potentially leading to unequal tax burdens for individuals with similar incomes. This deviation from horizontal equity can result in inequities, as extenders benefit those with greater ability to pay. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens among individuals with similar incomes, impacting tax fairness. Those with higher incomes benefit more from extenders, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. For example, a tax deduction for classroom expenses can vary in value based on income tax brackets, favoring higher-income taxpayers. This complexity adds to the inequities in the tax system. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens among individuals with similar incomes, impacting tax fairness. Higher-income taxpayers benefit more from extenders, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Extenders contribute to the complexity of the tax code and raise administration costs. The cost of administering the tax system is rarely included in the analysis of temporary tax provisions. Expired provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, classified into individual, business, charitable, or energy categories. The individual and business tax extender provisions that expired at the end of 2014 were previously extended in P.L. 114-113. Key provisions include the above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit benefits. Some provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Several business tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, including the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and New Markets Tax Credit. Some provisions, such as enhanced expensing and active financing exception, were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were extended through 2019 or 2016. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, with wind PTC extended through 2019. Other energy-related provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 were also extended. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) included tax incentives for energy efficient new homes, commercial buildings, and existing homes. Alternative technology vehicle incentives were also introduced, with some expiring in 2014. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 but was extended in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 extended the alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles through 2016. Congress regularly extends expired tax provisions, with the cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. The cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of the total cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $559.5 billion. Permanent extension of provisions that expired in 2014 amounts to $361.4 billion. Only $17.7 billion was for the two-year extension of provisions that expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation in the 114th Congress considered making certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The cost estimate for extending these provisions, including macroeconomic effects, was $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. Certain expired provisions affecting businesses, like the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments, are expected to increase economic growth in the near term. The cost estimate for extending tax provisions, including macroeconomic effects, is lower than without them. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. Extending tax provisions, including bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing, would cost billions. Most of the revenue cost is for provisions that were either extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels likely to occur, resulting in smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline. The cost of a short-term extension is less than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. The cost of extending expiring tax provisions, such as bonus depreciation, is less when done through short-term extensions compared to extending them through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions, while JCT scores reflect the impact relative to current law. For example, the one-year extension of bonus depreciation in 2015 cost $45.3 billion, but only $1.2 billion over the 10-year budget window. The revenue loss from bonus depreciation in 2015 was $45.3 billion, with costs recovered in later years. The extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 cost $11.3 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation in 2015 made certain tax provisions permanent and extended others temporarily. During the 113th and 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to extend expired tax provisions, with the Senate Finance Committee reporting the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend provisions through 2016. The House also passed bills to make certain tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances and S corporation provisions. Additionally, the America Gives More Act of 2015 included three expired charitable provisions. Several tax provisions were proposed during the 113th and 114th Congress to extend or make permanent expired provisions, including charitable deductions, research tax credits, and deductions for state and local taxes. These measures would have cost $317.5 billion over a 10-year budget window. During the 113th Congress, bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions. A one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was passed, while the Senate Finance Committee proposed a two-year extenders package. The House also passed legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent, which would have reduced revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. During the 113th Congress, various tax extender provisions were considered for extension or permanency. The Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719) included several charitable-related provisions. Some international-related extender provisions were proposed to be made permanent but were not considered by the full House. Certain provisions expired at the end of 2013 and were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not included in the EXPIRE Act but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit, first enacted in the Trade Act of 2002, had a termination date of January 1, 2014, which was later extended. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in the Trade Act of 2002 and had a termination date of January 1, 2014, which was later extended through December 31, 2019. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended in P.L. 113-295 but was included in subsequent legislation. Incentives for various alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Other energy-related provisions, such as partial expensing of certain refinery property and the credit for energy efficient appliances, were not extended past their January 1, 2014, termination date. The EXPIRE Act did not extend the termination date for partial expensing of certain refinery property and the credit for energy efficient appliances. Additionally, two disaster-related provisions expired at the end of 2013 and were not extended in P.L. 113-295."
