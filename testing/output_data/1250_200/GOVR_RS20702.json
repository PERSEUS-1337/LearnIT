    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in projects to restore the Everglades, coordinated under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is a crucial part of the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges, national park units, and a large population. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades once spanned 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, consisting of subtropical wetland landscapes fed by several hundred lakes. The Everglades, a network of subtropical wetland landscapes, once stretched 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay. Water flowed south through slow-moving creeks and marshes, acting as natural filters and recharging aquifers. Human interventions in the mid-1800s led to flood control and reclamation efforts, altering the Everglades' hydrology for development and agriculture. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps is a significant intervention affecting the Everglades. The Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) project by the Army Corps of Engineers has significantly altered the Everglades' water regime, directing water into canals and rivers instead of allowing it to flow naturally. This has led to habitat loss, threatening numerous plant and animal species, and degraded water quality due to pollutants from urban areas and agricultural runoff. The Everglades ecosystem has changed, receiving less water during the dry season and more during the rainy season, reducing its size by half. Habitat loss and degraded water quality in the Everglades are caused by pollutants from urban areas and agricultural runoff. Nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen have harmed plant and animal populations, leading to a decline in native vegetation and an overabundance of invasive species. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida, coordinated by the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, aim to address these issues with a focus on improving water quality, preserving natural habitats, and restoring the balance of ecosystems. The estimated cost for achieving these goals in South Florida is nearly $20 billion. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to restore natural hydrologic functions and water quality in South Florida by capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season. The plan includes removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water to replicate natural flow. CERP was approved under Title VI of WRDA 2000 and received $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized under Title VI of WRDA 2000, with $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, including the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand restoration projects, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Construction and operation costs of CERP projects are shared equally by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government. Federal agencies responsible for CERP components receive appropriations through annual bills. Support for CERP remains broad, but concerns persist over implementation, project prioritization, federal efforts, and mitigation of excess phosphorous. Issues also include restoration effectiveness and technological uncertainties. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects, with a focus on the state's Acceler8 initiative for priority projects. Stakeholders worry that Acceler8 may prioritize water supply needs over other restoration goals. Some stakeholders are concerned that the Acceler8 prioritization may shift focus towards meeting water supply needs, potentially reducing attention to ecosystem restoration investments. Proponents argue that priority projects offer both water supply and restoration benefits, but federal funding pace is seen as too slow. Concerns also exist regarding specific Everglades restoration projects with primarily local benefits and increasing costs associated with land acquisition. The costs of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) have increased, mainly due to rising land acquisition expenses. Concerns have been raised about the delay in completing CERP projects and the potential diversion of funds from other ecosystem restoration projects nationwide. Delays in projects like the Modified Waters Deliveries Project may jeopardize the feasibility of the overall plan. The Mod Waters project, a pre-CERP initiative to restore flows to Everglades National Park, may impact the implementation of CERP components on the eastern side of the park. WRDA 2000 linked CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration, delaying specific CERP appropriations until Mod Waters is complete. Controversy also surrounds a 2003 Florida law extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines, potentially compromising restoration efforts. Provisions in the FY2006 Interior Appropriations Act conditioned funds on achieving water quality standards in federal properties, a requirement also present in FY2004 and FY2005 appropriations. The FY2006 Interior Appropriations Act includes provisions for achieving water quality standards in federal properties, with potential reductions in restoration appropriations if standards are not met. Congressional interest is shown in overseeing water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida. Some groups question the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in Everglades restoration, citing concerns about water quality improvement measures and the plan's focus on water supply over ecological restoration. Despite revisions to include restoration activities earlier in the project implementation sequencing, opposition to CERP persists among some environmental groups and scientists. Some environmental groups and scientists oppose CERP due to concerns about Florida's financial contributions and the use of funds designated for land acquisition. The National Research Council emphasizes the importance of acquiring land early in the restoration process to prevent irreversible damage. Questions have been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee, flood management, integration of water management issues, and the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on Everglades restoration efforts. Ecosystem restoration in the Everglades is a young science with uncertainties, managed through adaptive management in CERP. Pilot projects, like aquifer storage and recovery, aim to test new strategies, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. The use of funds and land acquisition in CERP has faced opposition, with concerns about Lake Okeechobee management, flood control, water integration, and climate change impacts on restoration efforts."
