This trend raises concerns about financial security during retirement, especially for those relying on fixed incomes like Social Security. The aging population and growing debt levels suggest that many older Americans are not retiring debt-free. The report presents evidence of the increase in debt among households headed by those aged 65 and older from 1989 to 2016. Higher debt levels may lead to financial insecurity, psychological stress, and decreased physical health for retirees. The discussion focuses on changes in debt percentages, median and average debts, types of debt, and debt-to-income and debt-to-asset ratios among older Americans. Debt among older Americans varies across age groups and asset distributions, with major types including residential debt, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. The report does not cover nonloan debt. Traditional life-cycle theories predict borrowing in young adulthood, slowing in middle age, and deleveraging in old age, which aligns with Americans' debt experiences from 1989 to 2016. Households headed by individuals aged 35 to 54 had the highest debt levels, while younger and older age groups had lower debt levels. In the past three decades, household debt among Americans aged 65 and older increased significantly. Average household debt nearly doubled for those under 60, but increased by 4 times for those aged 60-64, and by even more for older age groups. Debt includes mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit cards. The share of elderly households with debt and the levels of debt have risen from 1989 to 2016. The median and average levels of debt have increased among elderly households from 1989 to 2016. In 1989, about 37.8% of elderly households held debt, whereas in 2016 the share increased to 61.1%. The median debt of elderly households with debt increased from $7,463 to $31,050, and the average debt increased from $29,918 to $86,797. Median and average debt peaked in 2010 after the economic recession and declined from 2010 to 2016. The financial crisis from 2010 to 2016 had a profound effect on the older population, leading to increased debt levels. Older individuals faced employment instability, longer job searches, and lower-paying jobs. Defined contribution retirement plans replaced defined benefit plans, impacting retirement income. Mismanagement of retirement accounts and stock market drops during the crisis reduced potential retirement income for many older Americans. The financial crisis led to increased debt levels for older Americans, with mortgages being the main source of household debt. Auto loans also contributed to the growth in debt among elderly households. Residential loans are seen as long-term wealth builders, less stressful than other debts like credit card balances. Elderly households have seen an increase in certain types of debt from 1989 to 2016, including debt on primary and other residences, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. The share of elderly households with debt secured by a primary residence rose from 15.4% in 1989 to 33.4% in 2016, with the median debt amount increasing from $16,793 to $72,000 in real 2016 dollars. Research suggests that the growth in mortgage debt before 2007 was due to increased availability of mortgage credit, leading to older Americans carrying more mortgage debt. Since 2010, tightening mortgage underwriting standards have made it harder for young borrowers to qualify for mortgages, shifting new mortgage originations towards older borrowers. Elderly households have also seen an increase in debt on other residential properties and auto loans from 1989 to 2016. The share of elderly households with debt secured by other residences rose from 2.7% to 4.4%, with the median debt increasing from $23,323 to $98,000. Auto loans among elderly households increased from 10.3% to 21.2%, with the median auto loan growing from $7,463 to $11,000. The proportion of elderly households with auto loan debt increased from 10.3% to 21.2%, with the median auto loan amount growing from $7,463 to $11,000 in 2016 dollars. Additionally, the share of elderly households with student loans rose from 0.5% in 1989 to 2.4% in 2016, with the median amount increasing from $7,463 to $12,000. Elderly borrowers are more likely to default on student loans, leading to Social Security benefits being offset to pay off the loans, with the number of affected individuals increasing from 6,000 in FY2002 to 38,000 in FY2015. The number of elderly individuals whose Social Security benefits were used to pay off student loans increased from 6,000 in FY2002 to 38,000 in FY2015. Credit card debt among elderly households rose significantly from 1989 to 2016, becoming the most common type of debt. Older Americans may struggle with higher interest rates on credit card debt, leading to increased financial strain and potential bankruptcy filings. Elderly individuals had 50% more credit card debt than younger debtors, citing interest and fees as main reasons for bankruptcy. Debt burden is measured by debt payment-to-income ratio and debt-to-asset ratio. The debt payment-to-income ratio for elderly households with debt increased from 8.7% in 1989 to 16.7% in 2010, then declined to 12.4% in 2016. The ratio was lower for elderly households compared to nonelderly households in 1989 but the difference decreased over time. In 2016, the ratio for nonelderly households was 13.8%. In 2016, the debt payment-to-income ratio for nonelderly households was 13.8%, compared with 12.4% for elderly households. Delinquency on loan payments for elderly households was around 3.9% in 2016, fluctuating between 1% and 5% from 1989 to 2016. The debt-to-asset ratio is another measure of debt burden, indicating that households with more assets are less likely to default on debt. The debt-to-asset ratio for elderly households increased from 5.1% in 1989 to 9.0% in 2016, with a faster growth rate compared to nonelderly households. The residential debt-to-asset ratio contributed significantly to this increase, reaching 7.4% in 2016. Additionally, the proportion of elderly households with a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 50% also rose during this period. The proportion of elderly households with a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 50% increased from 7.4% in 1989 to 11.2% in 2016. Researchers also found a rise in older Americans filing for bankruptcy, with a significant increase in bankruptcy filers aged 65 and older from 2.1% in 1991 to 12.2% in 2013-2016. Older filers are in worse financial shape than younger filers, with difficulties in accumulating assets post-bankruptcy. Older debtors face more challenges post-bankruptcy compared to younger debtors, as they struggle to accumulate assets. Elderly debtors have difficulty finding well-paying jobs and building retirement savings. Bankruptcy does not improve their health or access to healthcare. Research shows that older bankruptcy filers are more likely to continue to struggle financially. Among elderly households, those aged 80 and older saw the largest increase in debt over the past three decades. In 2016, the proportion of elderly households with any debt declined with age, with 70% of households aged 65-74 holding debt, 61% for those aged 75-79, and 42% for those aged 80 and older. The share of elderly households with debt increased over time for all age groups, with the largest growth seen in the oldest age groups. Median household debt among elderly households increased over time for each age group, peaking around the financial crisis. For households headed by those aged 80 and older, real median debt was $933 in 1989. Elderly households across all age groups have seen an increase in debt over time, peaking around the financial crisis. Median debt for those aged 80 and older rose from $933 in 1989 to $20,000 in 2016. Primary residential debt showed the largest growth, followed by other residential debt, auto loans, credit card balances, and student loans. The debt-to-asset ratio also increased for all age groups, with the most significant rise among households headed by individuals aged 80 and older. The debt-to-asset ratio increased significantly for elderly households, especially those headed by individuals aged 80 and older. Residential debt was the main contributor to the overall debt growth for elderly households. Analyzing changes in debt across different asset levels is crucial as wealthy households may skew average measures, and elderly households often rely on drawing down assets to meet debt obligations. Elderly households' debt-to-asset ratio increased significantly, especially for those aged 80 and older. Residential debt was the main contributor to overall debt growth. Analysis of debt changes across different asset levels is important as wealthy households can skew averages, and elderly households often rely on assets to meet debt obligations. Data in Table 4 shows debt distribution by asset quintile among elderly households. The share of elderly households holding debt increased across all asset quintiles from 1989 to 2016. Those in the lowest asset quintile were least likely to hold debt, but saw an increase from 36.2% to 49.5%. Elderly households in the middle asset quintiles had the largest growth in debt probability. Median debt increased for all asset quintiles, with a larger percentage increase for those in the middle. Average debt for elderly households across different asset quintiles increased from 1989 to 2016. The largest growth was seen in the middle asset quintiles, with real median debt increasing by about three to four times. In the lowest asset quintile, average debt doubled, while in the highest quintile, it increased by about $135,000. The growth in average debt was mainly driven by primary residential debt, credit card debt, and auto loans. From 1989 to 2016, the increase in average debt among elderly households was mainly driven by residential debt, credit card debt, and auto loans. Primary residential debt contributed to 54% of the growth in average debt, while credit card debt and auto loans explained 30% and 20% respectively. Different asset quintiles showed varying proportions of debt growth, with higher-asset households also including mortgage debt for second homes. Overall, primary residential debt accounted for a significant portion of the debt growth across all asset quintiles, with variations in the sources of debt among different household categories. Elderly households in the bottom asset quintile had a higher proportion of debt in other forms, which decreased from 1989 to 2016. In 2016, these households still had a 43% debt-to-asset ratio, with most debt from nonresidential loans like credit card debt and auto loans. The debt-to-asset ratio for households in the lowest asset quintile decreased over time, but residential debt slightly increased. Debt among elderly households has increased over the past 30 years, with most of the rise in residential debt. The debt-to-asset ratio for elderly households with debt increased from 5.1% to 9.0% from 1989 to 2016. Despite the increase in debt, many older Americans have balanced their debt with assets, suggesting that the rise in debt is not necessarily linked to financial insecurity in retirement. The debt-to-asset ratio among elderly households with debt increased from 5.1% to 9.0% between 1989 and 2016. Older adults may adjust behavior to meet debt obligations, with a study showing increased likelihood of working and decreased likelihood of retirement. Data from the SCF indicates a rise in elderly households with either the head or spouse working, from 19.8% in 1989 to 29.7% in 2016. Rising debt burden is evident among certain elderly households, particularly those aged 80 and older, with a notable increase in debt-to-asset ratio. Older Americans face income risks due to lower earnings, reduced retirement resources, decreased purchasing power in pensions, and higher medical expenses. High levels of housing debt increase vulnerability to market swings, impacting retirement security. Managing debt is crucial for retirement adequacy."
