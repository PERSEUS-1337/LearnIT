    "content": "The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003, also known as the Electric Reliability Standards, amends the Federal Power Act to include a new section on electric reliability. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, Electric Reliability Organization, and reliability standards for ensuring the reliable operation of the transmission network. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the operation of bulk-power system facilities, ensuring reliable operation within specified limits to prevent system failures. It also defines \"Interconnection\" as a synchronized geographic area where the failure of one component can impact the reliability of others. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines terms related to bulk-power system operation, including \"transmission organization\" and \"regional entity.\" The Act grants the Commission jurisdiction over ERO, regional entities, and bulk-power system users for approving and enforcing reliability standards. Compliance with these standards is mandatory for all system users. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 mandates compliance with reliability standards for all users, owners, and operators of the bulk-power system. The Commission will issue a final rule within 180 days to implement these requirements. Following this, any person can apply for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), subject to certain criteria. The Electric Reliability Organization must ensure balanced decision-making, allocate dues fairly, enforce standards impartially, involve public input, and seek recognition in Canada and Mexico for reliability standards. The Electric Reliability Organization in Mexico must file proposed reliability standards with the Commission for approval. The Commission will consider technical expertise but not defer on competition issues when approving standards. Regional entities can propose standards within their Interconnection. The Electric Reliability Organization must submit proposed reliability standards to the Commission for approval. The Commission will presume proposals from regional entities for Interconnection-wide standards to be just, reasonable, and in the public interest. If the Commission disapproves a standard, it will be sent back to the Electric Reliability Organization for further consideration. The Commission can also order new standards to be submitted if necessary. Fair processes for resolving issues must be included in the final rule. The final rule adopted under subsection (b)(2) shall include fair processes for resolving conflicts between reliability standards and Commission-approved provisions applicable to a transmission organization. The organization must comply with Commission-approved provisions until a conflict is identified, ordered to change, and the change becomes effective. If a reliability standard needs modification due to a conflict, the ERO will be directed to develop and submit a modified standard. The ERO has the authority to impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. The ERO has the authority to impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system for violations of reliability standards approved by the Commission. Penalties can take effect after 31 days unless reviewed by the Commission. Application for review does not automatically stay the penalty. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. Penalties can be reviewed by the Commission, which may affirm, set aside, reinstate, or modify them after a hearing. Expedited procedures are in place for such hearings. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. Regulations authorize the ERO to delegate authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards if certain conditions are met. The ERO and the Commission presume that delegation to a regional entity on an Interconnection-wide basis promotes effective administration of bulk-power system reliability. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. Regulations allow the ERO to delegate authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards. Delegation to a regional entity is presumed to promote effective administration of bulk-power system reliability. The ERO must seek approval from the Commission for any proposed rule changes. The Electric Reliability Organization must seek approval from the Commission for any proposed rule changes, which must be just, reasonable, not discriminatory, and in the public interest. The ERO conducts periodic assessments of the bulk-power system's reliability. The President is encouraged to negotiate international agreements with Canada and Mexico for compliance with reliability standards. The ERO has authority to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for the bulk-power system only. The Electric Reliability Organization has authority to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for the bulk-power system only. States can take action to ensure safety and reliability of electric service as long as it does not conflict with any reliability standard. The Commission can determine if a State action is inconsistent with a reliability standard after consultation with the ERO and the State. The Commission may stay State actions pending issuance of a final order. Regional advisory bodies can provide advice on governance and standards within a region. The Commission may consider the justness and reasonableness of proposed fees in a region, and may defer to advice from regional advisory bodies. Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from these provisions."
