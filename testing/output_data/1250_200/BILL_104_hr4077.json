The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 allows the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hunting of migratory birds to prevent overharvesting. Prohibitions on certain hunting methods have been in place for over 60 years, with the exception of the interpretation of baiting regulations. The prohibitions on hunting migratory birds with bait have led to interpretive difficulties for hunters and law enforcement. Clarification is needed to ensure compliance with regulations and protection of the bird resource. The restrictions on baiting in hunting should not hinder habitat management and wildlife food crops. SEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS. Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to prohibit the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including traps, snares, nets, firearms larger than 10 gauge, and certain types of vehicles or aircraft. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including restrictions on using motorboats or sailboats with motors attached, except for retrieving dead or crippled birds. Live birds as decoys are also prohibited. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including restrictions on using recorded or electrically amplified bird calls, possessing certain types of shot, and hunting in areas designated as nontoxic shot zones. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits taking migratory birds using baiting methods, except for specific exemptions like hunting over standing crops or lands where feed has been distributed for wildlife management purposes. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act allows for the taking of migratory game birds over moist soil on emergent marsh plants that have been manipulated as part of normal wetland habitat practices by the landowner or their agent. This includes wetland plant species like watergrass, smartweed, bulrush, swamp timothy, spike rush, wild rice, and sedge. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act allows for the taking of migratory game birds over moist soil on emergent marsh plants like cocklebur, curly dock, Pigweed, cattail, beggarticks, giant reed grass, joint grass, johnson grass, and goosefoot. Baiting is defined as intentionally placing feed to attract birds in areas where hunters are attempting to take migratory game birds. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act allows for the taking of migratory game birds over moist soil on emergent marsh plants. Baiting is defined as intentionally placing feed to attract birds in areas where hunters are attempting to take migratory game birds. Normal agricultural operations include growing crops, planting for erosion control, top sowing of crops, and distributing or scattering grains.

Baiting is defined as intentionally placing feed to attract birds in areas where hunters are attempting to take migratory game birds. Normal agricultural operations include growing crops, planting for erosion control, top sowing of crops, and distributing or scattering grains. Cooperative State research, education, and extension services, State fish and wildlife agencies, and State extension agricultural offices determine if baiting is normal in a specific regional area and publish the determination annually in the Federal Register. The terms 'attraction' and 'attracting' refer to bait being a major factor in luring migratory birds within shotgun range. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to deposit fines into a conservation fund for acquiring bird refuges. Penalties under the Act now allow for posting bond instead of seizing property."
