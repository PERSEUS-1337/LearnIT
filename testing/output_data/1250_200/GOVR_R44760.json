    "content": "A state may apply to waive certain ACA provisions for plan years starting in 2017, including sections related to qualified health plans, health insurance exchanges, cost-sharing reductions, premium tax credits, employer mandate, and individual mandate. The ACA allows states to waive certain provisions, including those related to qualified health plans, health insurance exchanges, cost-sharing reductions, premium tax credits, employer mandate, and individual mandate. The waiver process involves review and approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Treasury Secretary. The ACA allows states to waive provisions such as premium tax credits and mandates. The Secretary of HHS or Treasury assesses waiver applications based on coverage, affordability, and federal-deficit neutrality. Waivers may be granted if they promote access to affordable coverage, sustainable spending, state innovation, support for those in need, and consumer-driven healthcare. The assessment does not consider policy changes dependent on further state action or federal approval. The assessment of state innovation waiver applications by the Secretary of HHS or Treasury does not consider changes to Medicaid or CHIP that require approval outside of the waiver process. Savings from changes to Medicaid or CHIP are not factored into determining deficit-neutrality. Technical enhancements now allow CMS to support some federally coordinated waiver applications. In October 2018, HHS and the Treasury updated guidance indicating that CMS can now support some federally facilitated health insurance exchange (FFE) variations. States can request waivers that incorporate CMS's enrollment functionalities while still using HealthCare.gov for consumer-facing aspects. States must fund FFE modifications and operational support, which are not factored into deficit-neutrality assessments for waiver applications. However, federal operational considerations may limit the scope of waivers, with the IRS generally unable to accommodate state-specific changes. The IRS may limit state-specific changes to tax rules, but small changes to federal tax provisions can be accommodated if they align with current IRS capabilities. States must fund any changes to IRS administrative processes for waiver implementation, which are considered in deficit-neutrality assessments. States seeking a waiver must enact a law enabling waiver actions before applying. States seeking a waiver must enact a law enabling waiver actions before applying. A state can be considered to have enacted such a law by coupling a state law that enforces ACA provisions and/or the state plan with administrative or executive actions. The state must provide public notice, conduct hearings, and submit the application to the Secretary of HHS. The Secretary of HHS transmits the application to the Secretary of the Treasury for review. The application must include specific materials and analyses to be considered complete. The state's application for a waiver must meet requirements and be complete for review. Once deemed complete, the application is made public for comments. The final decision must be made within 180 days. Approved waivers may result in the loss of certain federal subsidies for residents. The state innovation waiver allows states to receive pass-through funding equivalent to the subsidies they would have received without the waiver. The funding is determined annually and can be used for implementing the waiver plan. Waivers cannot exceed five years unless extended. The Secretaries must coordinate applications for state innovation waivers with other health care waivers. The state innovation waiver allows states to submit a single application for multiple waivers available under federal law, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. HHS and the Treasury assess state innovation waiver applications independently from other federal approvals. 14 states have submitted applications, with eight approvals so far. Eight states have received approval for state innovation waivers from HHS and the Treasury: Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vermont had incomplete applications, while California, Iowa, and Oklahoma withdrew their applications."
