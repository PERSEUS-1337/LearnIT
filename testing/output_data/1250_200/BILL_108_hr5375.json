    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). The audits revealed inadequate management of contracts, including failure to adhere to provisions, maintain staffing levels, overcharging, and engaging in unprofessional conduct. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs failed to manage contracts properly, leading to overcharging and unprofessional conduct. The United Nations denied the United States access to OIOS audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, despite repeated requests. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs mismanaged contracts, resulting in overcharging and unprofessional conduct. The United States repeatedly requested access to OIOS audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, but the United Nations' nondisclosure policy hindered member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities. Congress urges the President to ensure that OIOS audit reports are promptly shared with member states of the United Nations. The Department of State must assess financial disclosure rules for UN officials and propose reforms within 180 days. In this Act, the term \"oil-for-food program\" refers to the UN program allowing the sale of Iraqi petroleum products for humanitarian aid. The term \"Office of Internal Oversight Services\" denotes the UN office monitoring program implementation and conducting audits. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" includes specific committees in the House and Senate. The appropriate congressional committees overseeing the oil-for-food program include the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate."
