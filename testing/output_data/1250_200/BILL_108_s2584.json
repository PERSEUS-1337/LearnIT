    "content": "The \"Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004\" allows for a credit for farmer investment in value-added agricultural property under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004 provides a 50% credit for eligible persons or farmer-owned entities on the basis of qualified value-added agricultural property placed in service during the taxable year. The maximum credit is $30,000 for property placed in service by an eligible person, and it is allocated on a pro rata basis among eligible persons in a farmer-owned entity. The credit for property placed in service by a farmer-owned entity is limited to the eligible person's creditable investments in the entity. Creditable investments are the qualified investments made by the eligible person in the entity, minus previous investments taken into account for property already in service. The credit for property placed in service by a farmer-owned entity is limited to the eligible person's qualified investments in all farmer-owned entities, not exceeding $30,000 per taxable year. Qualified value-added agricultural property adds value to goods derived from organic matter. The eligible person must be involved in an eligible farming business to qualify for the credit for property derived from organic matter. The property must have a useful life of 3 years or more and be owned and operated by an eligible person or a farmer-owned entity. The credit for property derived from organic matter is available to an eligible person involved in an eligible farming business. Material participation in farming is determined similarly to section 2032A(e)(6). An eligible farming business is defined as a farming business that is not a passive activity under section 469(c). A farmer-owned entity is defined as a corporation, including an S corporation. A farmer-owned entity is a corporation, partnership, or cooperative where eligible persons own at least 50% of the voting power and stock/profits/member patronage interests. Ownership rules are similar to constructive ownership rules. Ownership rules for a farmer-owned entity involve eligible persons owning at least 50% of the voting power and stock/profits/member patronage interests. Constructive ownership rules apply, with family members including spouse, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren residing in the same household or jointly operating farming businesses. Qualified investments are also defined. The term 'qualified investments' refers to cash payments for purchasing equity interests in a farmer-owned entity, including stock in a domestic corporation, interests in a domestic partnership, and patronage interests. The tax rules apply to qualified investments acquired between 2004 and 2011, including patronage interests in cooperatives. Special rules apply for married individuals filing separately, with a reduced threshold. Regulations cover credit allocation for estates and trusts, and certain properties are not eligible for the tax benefits. Rules similar to section 50(b) apply for certain ineligible properties. Basis adjustment occurs when a credit is allowed for qualified value-added agricultural property, reducing the property's basis by the credit amount. Recapture rules under section 50(a) apply if the property ceases to qualify within 5 years of being placed in service. The rules state that if the qualified value-added agricultural property ceases to qualify, is disposed of, or the eligible person/farmer-owned entity no longer qualifies, certain actions are triggered. In the event of death, the period is suspended for 2 years. If an heir is also an eligible person, special rules apply to the transfer of property. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. Property placed in service after December 31, 2010, is not covered. The value-added agricultural property investment credit is included in the general business credit. The credit can be used against minimum tax. The tax code is amended to include the value-added agricultural property credit in the general business credit. The credit can be used against minimum tax, and there are limitations on carryback of the credit before the effective date. The tax code is amended to include the value-added agricultural property investment credit in the general business credit. Unused credits cannot be carried back before the effective date of the new section. Basis adjustment is also made for payments related to the credit. The tax code is amended to include a new paragraph allowing for payments with a credit under section 38. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The tax code is amended to include a new value-added agricultural property investment credit under section 45G, effective for investments made after December 31, 2004."
