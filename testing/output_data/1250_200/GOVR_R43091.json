    "content": "The U.S. Congress has been addressing the issue of state courts considering a servicemember's military service in child custody hearings since 2007. Military members face challenges with custody arrangements during deployments, leading to custody battles when the military parent is away on duty. The proposed legislation aims to prevent military service from influencing child custody decisions in court, regardless of deployment status. There is a debate over federal intervention in child custody matters, with proponents arguing for federal involvement to protect servicemembers' rights. The proposed military child custody legislation, H.R. 1898, seeks to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to address child custody issues arising from increased deployments. Concerns include state courts considering a servicemember's deployments when making custody decisions, impacting military children's welfare and servicemembers' ability to serve effectively. Approximately 142,000 Armed Forces members are single custodians of minor children, with some servicemembers residing in households with a new spouse. Child custody cases involving deployed or deploying military parents can be complex, especially when a single servicemember has physical custody without a court order. The question of who cares for the children during deployments is typically handled by state family law courts. However, proponents of federal legislation argue for a national standard to prevent state courts from using a servicemember's deployment against them in custody determinations. Proponents of federal legislation argue for a national standard to prevent state courts from using a servicemember's deployment against them in child custody determinations. Opponents believe such legislation infringes on states' rights in family law matters and may prioritize the servicemember's legal rights over the child's best interests. Congressional interest in this issue stems from its authority over the armed forces and the need to regulate military child custody cases. The issue of state courts potentially using military service and deployments against servicemembers in child custody cases first came to light in the case of Kentucky National Guard Lieutenant Eva Slusher. Since 2008, there have been proposed amendments to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to establish a national standard for litigating child custody cases involving military custodians. The latest proposed legislation, H.R. 1898, mandates specific guidelines for temporary custodial orders. The proposed legislation H.R. 1898 mandates guidelines for temporary custodial orders in military custody cases, ensuring that deployment cannot be the sole factor in determining custody. It also establishes that state laws providing higher protection to deploying servicemembers will take precedence. The proposed legislation H.R. 1898 mandates guidelines for temporary custodial orders in military custody cases, ensuring deployment cannot solely determine custody. State laws offering greater protection to deploying servicemembers will prevail. Existing federal protection for single-parent servicemembers in custody disputes is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in child custody cases, allowing for temporary suspension of legal proceedings that may affect their civil rights during military service. Amendments in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act clarified the SCRA's applicability to child custody cases, requiring judges to grant stays of legal proceedings for the first 90 days of deployment. Additional stays can be requested based on the ongoing impact of military duty on participation in proceedings. Proponents argue that the SCRA is insufficient in protecting servicemembers' rights in child custody cases, as it does not prevent courts from considering military service against them in custody determinations. They also point out the lack of guidance on temporary custody arrangements and balancing servicemembers' interests with the best interest of the child. Opponents believe the SCRA, along with state laws, already provides adequate protection for military parents without the need for federal intervention. The SCRA provides military parents protection in child custody cases, including support and visitation rights, and cases without an original custody order. The DOD raised concerns about the lack of adherence to SCRA requirements in high-profile custody cases. This indicates a need for more education on the SCRA's use rather than issues with its limitations. The legislative debate centers on the conflict between federal protection of servicemembers' rights in child custody cases and state jurisdiction. Proponents argue for federal legislation to establish a national standard for military child custody cases, citing inconsistencies in state laws that could disadvantage servicemembers. They also highlight the risk of ex-spouses venue shopping to alter custody agreements. Proponents argue for federal legislation to establish a national standard for resolving military child custody cases, citing the risk of ex-spouses venue shopping to alter custody agreements. They believe this would resolve inconsistencies among states, provide more certainty, and enhance military readiness and morale. Opponents argue that child custody is a state law matter and federalizing it would remove the incentive for states to improve existing laws protecting servicemembers. The American Bar Association argues against federal legislation in the area of child custody, stating that states have the expertise to handle such matters. They believe that each case is unique and a single national standard would restrict flexibility in military custody cases. They emphasize that federal law should not dictate rules for custody and visitation, as this is the responsibility of state courts. Opponents argue against federal child custody legislation, stating that state courts should handle custody and visitation rules. They fear federal court involvement would lead to increased costs, delays, and uncertainty. They also highlight residency requirements that limit venue shopping. Both sides agree on avoiding bias based on military service but disagree on the impact of deployment on the child's best interest in custody determinations. When courts determine child custody, the best interest of the child is the ultimate criteria. Factors considered include the wishes of the parents and child, relationships with family members, comfort in home and community, and mental and physical health. Deployments are one of many factors courts consider in custody decisions, but rarely the sole factor. Federal legislation supporters argue that state courts sometimes disproportionately consider a servicemember's deployment in custody cases. Opponents of federal child custody legislation argue that deployment or the threat of deployment is not the sole factor in custody decisions involving servicemembers. They believe that enacting such legislation would prioritize the rights of servicemembers over the best interest of the child, which should be the primary consideration in custody cases. Additionally, they argue that the proposed legislation would only impact military service considerations in custody hearings and would not federalize such cases. The proposed federal child custody legislation could potentially lead to federal court involvement in military child custody cases, despite language in the legislation stating otherwise. Legal experts argue that the provision in the legislation may not prevent removal to federal court and cannot prevent federal review of rights conferred under federal statute. The American Bar Association believes that federal rights proposed in the legislation would directly involve federal courts in military child custody cases. The ABA believes that federal child custody legislation could result in federal court involvement in military cases, despite the bill not explicitly creating a federal right of action. The legislation does not prevent removal to federal court, potentially prolonging custody litigation. Despite passing in the House multiple times, similar bills have not made it out of Senate committees since 2008. The Senate has not passed any federal child custody bills introduced since 2008, citing concerns about federal intrusion in state matters and the adequacy of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act in protecting military personnel in custody disputes. Senator John McCain emphasized the historical deference to state laws in child custody issues and the need for caution in preempting state legislation. The Senate has shown historical deference to state laws in child custody issues, with concerns raised by expert associations. The Senate Veterans' Committee and the American Bar Association have opposed proposed legislation, leading to a call for more data on child custody disputes involving deployed military members. The Senate Veterans' Committee and the American Bar Association have opposed proposed legislation on child custody disputes involving deployed military members. The Senate emphasized the importance of personal responsibility of the servicemember in preparing effective family care plans. Family Care Plans are crucial for military readiness as they allow members of the Armed Forces to provide for their family when military duties prevent them from doing so. Properly prepared plans minimize legal difficulties that may arise during deployments, enabling servicemembers to focus on their mission. While not legally binding, Family Care Plans are effective in arranging care for dependent family members. Family Care Plans are essential for military readiness, allowing servicemembers to provide for their families during deployments or active duty. While not legally binding, these plans help arrange care for dependents. The Senate committee recommended obtaining the views of the Council of Governors on legislative proposals related to Family Care Plans under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Senate committee is seeking the Council of Governors' input on legislative proposals regarding child custody disputes under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. They are concerned about preemptive federal legislation that could override state laws on this matter. The Senate committee is seeking input from State Governors on legislative proposals regarding child custody disputes under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Department of Defense has generally opposed federal child custody legislation, except for a brief period in early 2011. Former Secretary Gates expressed DOD's opposition to federal child custody legislation in a letter to Representative Turner in 2009. At present, some level of protection for Service members facing child custody issues exists in approximately 28 states, with varying approaches. Secretary Gates acknowledged steps to ensure protection, including personally contacting governors of states without legislation, including concerns over child custody matters in key quality of life issues, and improving liaison efforts between DOD offices. The Department is focusing on improving liaison efforts with state officials to address military custody concerns and working with the American Bar Association to provide free legal representation for Service members. Efforts also include updating and standardizing Family Care Plans across the services, with the belief that these actions can resolve issues in favor of Service members more effectively than new federal legislation. The Department opposes new federal legislation that would disrupt State domestic schemes and increase costs. They encourage States to consider legislation addressing the special circumstances of military parents, recognizing the complexities of balancing the interests of Servicemembers and children. The Department opposes new federal legislation that would disrupt State domestic schemes and increase costs, encouraging States to address the special circumstances of military parents. DoD is updating its Family Care Plan guidance to the Services, reducing the need for legislation. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to report on child custody disputes involving deployed service members, based on 33 appellate cases since 2003. The DOD report found no evidence of servicemembers losing custody solely due to military service. State legislatures are deemed best for balancing interests. Federal intervention is discouraged, as the Supreme Court favors state courts for family matters. No trend exists in family courts for removing custody due to deployment. The Department of Defense report found no evidence of servicemembers losing custody solely due to military service. State legislatures are considered best for addressing child custody issues related to military service, and federal intervention is discouraged. Effective Family Care Plans are recommended to minimize potential disruptions in custody arrangements for deployed servicemembers. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern with the Department of Defense's report on custody arrangements for deployed servicemembers, stating that the report was limited in scope and relied on anecdotal data. The committee emphasized the importance of early consultation with non-custodial parents and recommended effective Family Care Plans to minimize disruptions in custody arrangements. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern with the limited data available for the report mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 regarding child custody arrangements for deployed servicemembers. The committee supports the need for congressional legislation to provide maximum protection for service members and their children. Secretary Gates reversed his opposition to federal child custody legislation in a letter to Representative Turner, stating the Department of Defense should consider a uniform standard for service members. DOD support for the legislation has been uncertain since Gates' departure in July 2011. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's support for the legislation was also questioned. Child custody legislation has been questioned, with former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's support for the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act (UDPCVA) of 2012 being scrutinized. Panetta expressed concerns that the legislation could prioritize the interests of adult service members over the best interest of the child. Former Secretary Panetta expressed concerns about child custody legislation prioritizing adult service members over the best interest of the child. He suggested adding \"as the sole factor\" to maintain flexibility for courts to decide in the child's best interest. The American Bar Association opposes federal child custody legislation, and it is unclear where Secretary of Defense Hagel stands on the issue. The American Bar Association opposes federal child custody legislation, arguing that it should be the responsibility of states rather than federal law. The ABA Resolution 106, passed in 2009, highlights the need for state laws to address protections for military members with custody during deployment. The American Bar Association opposes federal intervention in military family matters, advocating for state laws to address child custody issues for servicemembers during deployment. The National Governors Association also opposes federal involvement, stating that states are already taking steps to support military families. Nearly 30 states have passed legislation to address family law complexities for deployed parents, working closely with the Department of Defense. The Adjutants General Association of the United States opposes federal intervention in military family matters, stating that states have the resources and expertise to handle domestic relations issues effectively. AGAUS opposes federal intervention in military family matters, stating that state laws and courts are best equipped to handle domestic relations issues, including child custody cases involving National Guard and other service members. They believe state laws should determine family law matters and custody based on the best interest of the child, without federal interference.

Founded in 1969, NMFA focuses on issues important to military families. The National Military Family Association (NMFA) supports state laws regarding military family matters and advocates for educating judges on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.

The UDPCVA addresses child custody and visitation issues that arise during military deployment. The Uniform Law Commission created the UDPCVA to address child custody issues for deployed military parents, aiming to standardize custody rights across states. They oppose federal legislation in this area, arguing that family law should remain a state's rights issue to avoid unnecessary complexity. The UDPCVA aims to protect service members nationwide while respecting states' rights. Representative Turner argues that his bill would not create federal jurisdiction for custody matters but instead ensure minimum protections for military parents. He believes that the current uniformed law being considered would result in service members losing their children. Data shows that 46 states have passed military child custody legislation in line with the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act. Military child custody legislation is being considered by Congress to align with the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act. Currently, 46 states have passed laws, with exceptions in Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Mexico. The Senate is cautious about federal involvement, while the House shows strong support. The debate will focus on balancing federal intervention with state jurisdiction in military child custody cases. The future debate in Congress will focus on the need for federal involvement in military child custody cases, balancing state laws with potential legislation like H.R. 1898. The key factor will be determining the best interest of the child/children in custody cases. SEC. 208. CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION. If a court issues a temporary custody order based on a servicemember's deployment, the previous custody order must be reinstated upon the servicemember's return, unless not in the child's best interest. Deployment cannot be the sole factor in determining the child's best interest in custody cases. Federal jurisdiction or right of action is not created.
