    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included higher budget caps from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The enacted Agriculture appropriation totaled $23.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from FY2017. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2018, with the House passing a consolidated bill that included agriculture. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled $146 billion, including discretionary and mandatory spending. The bill funds USDA, FDA, and CFTC, with the Trump Administration releasing its budget request in May 2017. The FY2008 Agriculture appropriations bill focuses on discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total budget. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total budget. Mandatory spending comprised $123 billion, with $99 billion attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The largest discretionary spending items include WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, and farm assistance programs. The main mandatory spending items are SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for programs like SNAP, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" that requires annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. Funding for agriculture appropriations has fluctuated over the years, peaking in FY2010, declining through FY2013, and increasing since then. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The FY2018 budget enactment included higher total budget authority than the official discretionary spending allocation due to offsets from negative amounts in Title VII general provisions. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction for USDA in its FY2018 budget outline, released later than usual in March 2017. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to set final funding levels for FY2018 in May 2017. The Administration was reminded of Congress's role in determining final funding levels for fiscal year 2018. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. At the time the House appropriations subcommittees began marking up their FY2018 bills, an FY2018 budget resolution had not yet been adopted. The House Appropriations Committee incrementally made \"302(b)\" allocations to its subcommittees to facilitate markups beginning in June 2017. The Agriculture Subcommittee was allowed nearly $20 billion of discretionary budget authority for FY2018. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, by voice vote. On July 12, 2017, the full Appropriations Committee passed and reported an amended bill (H.R. 3268, H.Rept. 115-232) by voice vote. The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation (H.R. 3354) on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B, including budget-neutral amendments. The $20 billion discretionary total in the House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was officially $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017 (-5.3%). The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20.53 billion for FY2018 Agriculture, reducing funding for rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate-reported bill was $352 million less than FY2017. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 allocated $20.53 billion, $352 million less than FY2017. It proposed fewer reductions compared to the House-passed bill, with increases in foreign food aid and reductions in rural development and agricultural research. Congress passed CRs to fund the government as FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation. The Office of Management and Budget prorates funding to agencies annually during a CR through apportionment. The first CR for FY2018 lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. An across-the-board reduction and increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program were included in the CR. The first CR for FY2018 extended funding levels until December 8, 2017, with exceptions and anomalies for agriculture. Subsequent CRs extended funding further, with the fifth CR extending it to March 23, 2018, as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended funding levels until March 23, 2018, raised discretionary spending caps, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, and amended farm bill provisions. It added $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for FY2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) added $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for FY2018, including block grants for states affected by hurricanes and wildfires, funding for conservation and watershed recovery, rural water and wastewater recovery, and dairy programs. It also extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for two more years, offsetting some of the additions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for FY2026 and FY2027, impacting agriculture accounts by $2.6 billion. It raised budget caps for discretionary spending, leading to increased appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act increased the Agriculture portion's discretionary total to $23.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from FY2017. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is nearly as high as the peak in FY2010, totaling about $146 billion. It includes nearly $123 billion of mandatory spending, with an increase in General Provisions funding for various programs. Notable allocations include $500 million for rural water programs, $600 million for rural broadband expansion, $116 million for Food for Peace foreign aid, and $94 million for opioid enforcement at FDA. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act increases agricultural research spending by $138 million, including a $25 million increase for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. It also boosts funding for Food for Peace by $134 million to $1.6 billion. The act does not impose as many changes to mandatory program spending, costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit compared to FY2017. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act compares agency and program funding to House, Senate, and Administration proposals. Sequestration is a process of budget reductions triggered when spending exceeds goals. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. Sequestration continues to apply to certain accounts of mandatory spending despite the Bipartisan Budget Acts raising discretionary budget caps. The original FY2021 sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended multiple times, with Congress extending it until FY2027 as an offset in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are affected. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues until FY2027, with a 6.6% reduction rate resulting in about $1.3 billion less authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, while others like farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs are subject to it. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues until FY2027, with a 6.6% reduction rate resulting in about $1.3 billion less authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts.
