    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and security measures. It emphasizes the need for federal support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development to reduce post-disaster recovery costs for taxpayers. Disaster planning should focus on prevention to reduce costs for taxpayers. Comprehensive planning incorporating various strategies from urban planning, architecture, and design fields is essential. States need to update land use statutes to support safe community planning efforts. Efforts to update and reform statutes for comprehensive planning in safe communities are underway at the state level. Coordination between state and local plans is necessary for at-risk public infrastructure. Comprehensive urban planning considers land use, transportation, water facilities, and safety integration. Safe housing is crucial for community development, requiring modern planning techniques for a variety of housing options. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. This includes creating or revising land use planning statutes and plans that incorporate risk reduction and hazard mitigation, as well as developing comprehensive land use plans for multi-State regions. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. This involves citizen engagement, multi-jurisdictional cooperation, and multi-agency coordination in the planning process. Land use plans involve multi-agency coordination between Federal, State, and local government agencies, with implementation elements including timetables, roles, and responsibilities. Comprehensive planning is essential for assessing risks posed by natural hazards and terrorist acts. The text chunk discusses the importance of comprehensive planning in incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. It also emphasizes the need for updating these plans over time and ensuring they adhere to professional planning standards. Grant funds received by a government can be used for developing comprehensive land use plans. The government can use grant funds for various purposes including developing land use plans, assessing critical infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring technology for scenario planning, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability, and incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans. The grant funds can be used for various purposes such as developing land use plans, assessing critical infrastructure, updating building codes and zoning regulations, and incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans. The maximum grant amount is $1,125,000, with a federal share not exceeding 90% for most projects. The federal share can be increased for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations lacking sufficient funds. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General conducts audits to ensure grant funds are used as specified. Definitions for land use planning legislation are provided in this section. Definitions for land use planning legislation are provided in this section, including terms like \"land use planning legislation,\" \"comprehensive plan,\" and \"State.\" These definitions guide the regulation and management of land, natural resources, and development practices at the state and local levels. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to land use planning legislation, including Tribal government, State planning director, and local planning director. These definitions help regulate land use and development at the state, local, and Tribal levels. The curr_chunk defines \"Tribal government\" as the governing body of an Indian Tribe, as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This term is relevant in the context of guidance documents regulating land use and development within local government jurisdictions. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on best practices in land use and community planning to reduce natural hazard and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on the community, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report on community security planning will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate land use and development codes, software tools, security design standards, and infrastructure planning practices to enhance community safety. Consideration will be given to regional differences, cost-effectiveness, and risk reduction in determining best practices. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023: $57,250,000 allocated, with $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
