The Emergency Immigration Workload Reduction and Homeland Security Enhancement Act of 2003 includes provisions for the temporary suspension of various visa programs, restrictions on nonimmigrant visas for certain countries, waivers for temporary suspensions, and funding for detention and removal assistance by State and local law enforcement agencies. The Act also includes a severability clause and specifies the effective date of implementation. The Act will take effect in each local time zone on the first Sunday occurring two weeks after its enactment. The Congress emphasizes the importance of establishing the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security within the Department of Homeland Security to fulfill immigration enforcement responsibilities. Certain immigration programs may need to be temporarily suspended to ensure national security interests are not compromised. Certifications from the Secretary of Homeland Security are required for the effective transfer of immigration enforcement functions to the new Directorate. Temporary suspension of the Visa Waiver Program is also mentioned. Temporary suspension of the Visa Waiver Program, adjustment of status, renewals of Temporary Protected Status, and certain immigrant visa programs are all suspended to ensure national security interests are not compromised. The allocation of family-sponsored immigrant visas to certain relatives of citizens and permanent resident aliens is suspended under the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure national security interests are not compromised. The suspension of immigrant visas for certain family-sponsored and diversity immigrants under the Immigration and Nationality Act is in place to protect national security interests. This includes the suspension of admission for children of lawful permanent residents and diversity immigrants, as well as the filing of classification petitions for affected immigrant visa categories. SEC. 7. RESTRICTION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS FOR NATIONALS OF COUNTRIES DENYING OR DELAYING ACCEPTANCE OF ALIENS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will create a public listing of aliens with final removal orders but no significant likelihood of being removed soon due to countries refusing or delaying their acceptance. If 24 or more citizens of a foreign state are on this list, that state will be considered as denying or unreasonably delaying acceptance, leading to visa restrictions. The Secretary of State will be notified to discontinue nonimmigrant visa issuance to citizens of a foreign state if they refuse to accept aliens with final removal orders. This provision will sunset according to section 9. SEC. 8. WAIVERS OF TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive certain sections on a case-by-case basis or for designated classes of applicants, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. Delegation of waiver authority is also possible. Sections 3 through 8 will end one week after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to Congress that specific conditions are met, including the full operation of entry and exit data systems, machine-readable visas, and the capability to detain and remove individuals. The Department of Homeland Security can detain and remove aliens brought to their attention by state or local law enforcement agencies. Federal funds are available for reimbursement of verified claims. The data system for alien registration must comply with integration and interoperability standards. The Department of Homeland Security ensures timely entry of registrations and change of address notices into the data system as required by immigration laws. A program for random audits of immigration status change applications by aliens in the US has been fully implemented. The Department of Homeland Security has implemented a program to monitor fraud in immigration applications. The foreign student monitoring system is fully operational, ensuring educational institutions comply with immigration laws. A minimum of 25 aliens must be removed from the US in the months leading up to certification under this section. The certification under this section requires that certain criteria be met, including successful completion of reports and plans under the Homeland Security Act, elimination of immigration benefit application backlog, submission of required annual reports to Congress, and implementation of process changes outlined in the American Competitiveness Act. Process changes outlined in the American Competitiveness Act have been implemented and are operational. SEC. 10. SUSPENSION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS. The Secretary of State's authority to issue nonimmigrant visas and the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to admit nonimmigrant aliens into the United States are suspended. This includes the suspension of accepting applications for nonimmigrant visas and admission as a nonimmigrant. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these suspensions under certain conditions, including the repeal of certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and mandatory personal interviews for admission. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires personal interviews with consular officers for aliens admitted on nonimmigrant visas. A waiver granted under certain conditions may supersede the bar on nonimmigrant visas for certain aliens. SEC. 11. TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR DETENTION AND REMOVAL ASSISTANCE BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will reimburse law enforcement agencies for emergency medical care, housing, and transportation of detained aliens if certain conditions are met, including transfer to Federal custody and a determination of removability."
