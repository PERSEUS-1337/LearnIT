Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing billions in funding. The future of MTW is uncertain, with calls for changes to the program emerging. Critics argue that MTW agencies have been given too much flexibility without clear understanding of the program's impact. Calls for changes to the MTW program have emerged, with critics arguing that the flexibility given to PHAs has had negative impacts on low-income families. Supporters claim that the program has allowed PHAs to serve more families in unique and cost-effective ways. Conflicting views on the program's success have led to calls to end, change, or expand it. The effectiveness of MTW agencies' policies is difficult to evaluate, making it challenging to assess claims from both critics and supporters. The MTW demonstration program has sparked debates about its future, with some advocating for restructuring to better serve its original purpose of testing housing innovations. Others believe that MTW agencies have shown success in operating outside traditional regulations, suggesting a modified version of the program for the future of assisted housing. Despite controversy, policies developed by MTW agencies have influenced reforms in mainstream assisted housing programs. Lessons from the MTW program may inform future reforms in federal housing assistance programs as policymakers consider changes. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program was authorized by Congress in 1996 to provide PHAs with flexibility in designing housing assistance programs. The program aims to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices for low-income families. Up to 30 PHAs can participate in the program, with evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows up to 30 PHAs to participate in a competitive process to develop and test their own policies for assisted housing. Flexibilities include combining funding streams, waiving statutory requirements, and designing rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for low-income families. PHAs are held harmless in terms of funding, but there are limits on the flexibility allowed. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to develop and test their own policies for assisted housing. Participating PHAs must serve the same number and size-mix of families, with at least 75% being low-income. HUD sets housing quality standards, and waivers for certain provisions are prohibited. PHAs must seek public input and hold a public hearing before submitting an application. HUD monitors compliance with approved MTW plans. The Moving to Work (MTW) program allows Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to develop and test their own policies for assisted housing. PHAs must be approved by HUD to participate in the MTW program and comply with their plans. MTW agencies must submit annual reports to HUD detailing their use of funds and activities. The MTW program was developed in response to concerns about rising costs and management issues in public housing during the 1980s and 1990s. The MTW demonstration program was developed to address rising costs and management issues in public housing. Policy debates influenced the consideration of public housing reform, including exploring block granting and increasing family self-sufficiency. Some believed in devolving assisted housing programs to the local level for greater autonomy, while others argued for federal regulation to ensure federal housing goals like desegregation. The MTW demonstration program was created to tackle rising costs and management problems in public housing. Federal policymakers and housing practitioners believed that market-based approaches could reduce housing costs. HUD announced the program in 1996, receiving 43 applications from PHAs, selecting 30 for participation. The negotiation process for MTW agreements was complex and lengthy, with the first agreement reached in 1998. Delays in implementation may have been influenced by a housing reform law passed in 1998. In 2000, HUD allocated open spaces in the MTW program to housing authorities with more than 2,500 units. Congress directed HUD to add additional PHAs to the MTW demonstration through various legislative acts. Several MTW agencies completed their participation. HUD allocated open spaces in the MTW program to high-performing PHAs with fewer than 5,000 assisted housing units. Currently, 35 PHAs are participating in the MTW demonstration program, with four more agencies selected by HUD. Criticisms of HUD's implementation include poor performance selection, lack of uniform program structure, and data collection challenges. HUD faced challenges in data collection from MTW PHAs, hindering the evaluation of tenant outcomes and program costs. Reports on MTW policies were process-oriented, lacking in outcome comparisons. Criticisms led to HUD implementing a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve monitoring and oversight. The standard MTW agreement introduced uniform language and extended participation in the program until 2018, allowing for more systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies. However, it does not standardize performance data, limiting HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies. HUD has increased efforts to monitor compliance with statutory purposes and requirements, addressing undefined terms in the MTW statute. HUD has plans to require MTW agencies to define \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice,\" and provide a template for collecting data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" A 2011 assessment found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income, and most agencies served a similar number of families. The GAO report noted HUD's efforts to ensure compliance with statutory requirements but emphasized the need for standard definitions and a systematic evaluation process. The HUD IG report in September 2013 highlighted the challenges in evaluating MTW agencies' compliance with statutory requirements due to the lack of standard definitions and a systematic process. It recommended that HUD refrain from adding more MTW agencies until program administration improved. MTW agencies have implemented a variety of program activities, ranging from full transformation to modest policy changes, with different approaches in applying MTW policies to assisted households. MTW agencies have discretion in three policy areas: merging funding streams, determining assistance levels and conditions, and other administrative flexibilities. Policies may vary among agencies, and changes over time are noted. The report does not evaluate policy effectiveness. Agencies may opt for a block grant approach for funding instead of traditional streams. MTW agencies have the option to receive block grant assistance instead of traditional funding streams, allowing for more flexibility in how funds are used. The amount of block grant assistance is negotiated through the MTW agreement, and most agencies now opt for merged funding. A 2004 report showed that agencies initially used this flexibility in a limited manner. MTW agencies used funding flexibility to address financial shortfalls and develop support services for tenants to increase self-sufficiency. They also leveraged financing for low-income housing development, which would not have been feasible without merged funding. MTW agencies have used their block grant assistance to leverage financing for low-income housing development. Some agencies, like the Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority, have undertaken significant redevelopment projects using their funding flexibility. The Chicago Housing Authority attracted private investment for its \"Plan for Transformation\" by utilizing the merged MTW funding stream. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream was crucial for obtaining financing for transformation plans from private investors. Chicago Housing Authority used the funding stream for revenue bond financing, while Atlanta financed the replacement of distressed public housing. Other MTW agencies like Keene Housing Authority, Housing Authorities of the County of Santa Clara, and City of San Jose used funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments. This interest in conversion is driven by leveraging additional outside financing, which is limited in traditional public housing. MTW PHAs have more flexibility in project-basing vouchers compared to non-MTW PHAs. They can convert public housing to project-based vouchers, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. MTW agencies have greater flexibility in project-basing vouchers, including converting public housing, partnering with nonprofits, and serving special populations. The majority of MTW agencies are already utilizing project-based voucher assistance or have plans to do so, a much higher rate than non-MTW PHAs. These agencies can experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures, impacting the level of assistance provided to tenants. MTW agencies have the discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures. HUD issued guidance in 2011 requiring MTW agencies to determine housing assistance eligibility based on statutory income calculations. While MTW agencies can no longer use alternative income calculations, they can still implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Industry groups argue that current income calculations and rent structures are complex and discourage tenants from increasing their income. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures to deter income reporting and discourage tenants from increasing their income. This includes simplifying income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold. Over half of participating MTW agencies in 2011 used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. It is uncertain if these policies will continue in the future. Most MTW agencies have experimented with reducing income verification frequency, potentially forgoing additional revenue or increasing subsidy costs. 88% of MTW agencies use an alternate schedule for recertifying tenant income, adopting simpler income calculations. Cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown. Assisted tenants under traditional housing programs pay no more than 30% of their incomes. MTW agencies have experimented with alternative rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, stepped rents, and alternative subsidies. Most agencies have their own minimum rent policies, some have tiered rent policies, and others have flat rent policies. MTW agencies have adopted various alternative rent structures, including minimum, tiered, and flat rent policies. Some agencies have simplified utility calculations to determine subsidies. Officials believe these alternative structures encourage work, mimic the private market, and are easier to understand and administer. However, there is a lack of systematic data to evaluate the impact on tenant earnings and administrative work. MTW PHAs have implemented new requirements for tenants, such as work and time limit policies, to encourage self-sufficiency and serve more families. These policies vary across agencies, with time limits ranging from three to seven years. Implementing these policies may decrease administrative burdens for MTW agencies. Many MTW agencies have adopted policies to streamline operations, such as alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements. Some agencies have clustered inspections based on location or implemented risk-based inspections to reduce administrative burdens. Some MTW agencies have alternative inspection schedules, including risk-based inspections. Only a few agencies cluster inspections, with 38% inspecting less frequently than annually and 19% allowing self-certification. The MTW program requires housing to meet federal quality standards, and alternative inspection procedures have been deemed effective by HUD. The effectiveness of alternative HQS inspection procedures compared to regulated program procedures for ensuring Section 8 voucher-assisted rental unit quality has not been fully evaluated. MTW agencies have different reporting requirements to HUD, with MTW plans encouraging program creativity and strategic planning. MTW officials in 2004 believed that reporting requirements encouraged program creativity and strategic planning. Under the standard MTW agreement since 2008, agencies must include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval. However, the current reporting process allows agencies to self-report outcomes without verification. The Annual MTW Plan and Report heavily rely on self-reporting by MTW agencies, with some struggling to meet new requirements. HUD lacks capacity to accept data on MTW activities, hindering systematic evaluation of program outcomes. Despite observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD, the effectiveness and efficiency of MTW activities remain unverified. Since the beginning of the MTW demonstration program, concerns have been raised about its impact on assisted housing tenants. HUD suggests that MTW has allowed PHAs to provide more housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, the overall effect on tenants remains unclear as it has not been thoroughly studied. The MTW program may have provided benefits to low-income individuals by assisting more families, but this could be due to reducing assistance for current recipients. Self-sufficiency policies could help increase family income in the long term, but there are concerns about needy families losing access to assistance. Some MTW agencies have limited tenants' housing choices by reducing access to portability. Further research is needed to determine the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. The MTW demonstration program has allowed for the demolition of public housing in some communities, impacting tenants' lives. MTW agencies like Atlanta and Chicago have replaced demolished housing with vouchers and mixed-income developments, arguing that the new housing is of better quality. Tenant advocates oppose this displacement, stating it destroys communities and social networks. Tenant advocates have objected to large-scale displacement of public housing residents, arguing it destroys communities and social networks. Research on the effects of public housing demolition has shown positive outcomes for tenants, with improved health and living in lower-poverty neighborhoods. However, vulnerable tenants may not benefit as much and may require additional services. Some supporters believe MTW agencies are more cost-effective in administering assisted housing programs, as evidenced by high participation rates and congressional support. However, not all agree, with some advocates arguing that MTW agencies actually cost more than non-MTW agencies. Some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies administer assisted housing at a higher cost than non-MTW agencies, impacting funding for other PHAs. Supporters claim MTW agencies reduce administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. Traditional regulatory oversight is seen as necessary to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. MTW agencies operate without traditional regulatory oversight, defining their own goals and reporting to HUD. Supporters argue this allows for innovation and focus on outcomes. Monitoring of program funds and outcomes is uncertain, with agreements set to expire in 2018. Future of MTW program remains uncertain, with proposals to expand it into a permanent program. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain, with proposals to expand it into a permanent program. Supporters argue for innovation and focus on outcomes, while critics call for phasing it out and replacing it with targeted demonstrations for more meaningful evaluations. Policymakers are debating whether the MTW program should be a lab for testing new ideas or if some version of it is the future of assisted housing. The MTW demonstration program aims to test different approaches for housing assistance, focusing on reducing costs, promoting self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. However, the program's design and implementation have limited its effectiveness as a true demonstration. Some suggest changes to allow for clearer evaluation of the program's effectiveness. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for a systematic evaluation, focusing on targeted selection and high-performing agencies for policy evaluation and potential national adoption. Similar proposals are included in housing reform legislative acts. The MTW demonstration program has evolved from a compromise between transforming rental assistance programs into a block grant to becoming a desirable option for PHAs. Calls have been made to expand and make MTW a permanent program, with proposals like the Moving to Work Charter Program Act aiming to increase the number of eligible PHAs to at least 250. Some have proposed expanding MTW to 250 eligible PHAs and making it a permanent program. Concerns have been raised about block granting and deregulating federal housing assistance, citing potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections. HUD has also expressed concerns about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW program. HUD has concerns about the capacity of agencies entering the MTW program, recommending selection based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program is suitable for small PHAs. Options for policymakers include maintaining the program as is or making changes. Existing MTW agencies have agreements through 2018, with possible extensions. Congress may consider adding a small number of additional agencies. The existing MTW agencies have agreements through 2018, with the possibility for extensions at HUD's discretion. Congress may add a small number of additional agencies. HUD has taken steps to address critics' concerns by increasing reporting requirements, standardizing agreements, and including evaluation requirements for new agencies. Participating PHAs will continue to experiment with new policies that may influence assisted housing programs. Both HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Obama Administration and Members of Congress have proposed changes to rental assistance programs, including inspection and income calculation rules. Some proposed reforms for PHAs include changes to inspection and income calculation rules, rent policies, and the ability to \"voucher-out\" public housing. There is bipartisan support for some reforms, but controversy remains over changes to assistance amounts and conditions like time limits and work requirements. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the impact of these policies on residents."
