    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 includes provisions in Title II, Part A to support and hold teacher preparation programs accountable. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA, with H.R. 4508 being one bill that aims to make changes in teacher preparation programs. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) is being considered by the 115th Congress. H.R. 4508 aims to repeal provisions in Title II, while H.R. 6543 seeks to amend and extend Title II. The authorization for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various appropriations legislation. The report discusses current programs in Title II-A and key issues for the HEA reauthorization debate. Congressional action on this matter is ongoing. The report discusses key issues in the debate over the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), focusing on the historical context of teacher preparation in the United States. Traditional teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs) have been the norm, but alternative approaches have emerged, posing challenges to federal policy on program quality accountability. The growth of teacher preparation programs at IHEs began in the early 20th century, replacing normal schools that trained high school graduates to become teachers. The growth of teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs) began in the early 20th century, replacing normal schools that trained high school graduates to become teachers. The professionalization of teacher educators led to a split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines, with an emphasis on courses in pedagogy and passing related tests. Alternative routes to teacher certification have widened the gap between training in teaching practice and subject-matter expertise. Since the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, HEA Section 205(d) requires an annual report on teacher preparation programs. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report, mandated by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation programs. Data for the 2015-2016 academic year show 2,106 teacher preparation providers offering 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates, and producing 159,598 program completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 providers offered 26,589 programs, enrolling 499,800 candidates and producing 192,459 completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates, and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers based at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the program completers, with Texas leading at 11% and New York at 9%. In the 2012-2013 academic year, Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois were the top states for teacher preparation program completers. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlighted differences in training requirements between traditional and alternative route programs. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic. The most common subject areas of program completion are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score for state assessments was 74.4%, with over 95% of candidates passing the test. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program to support these programs. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program to support teacher preparation programs, such as the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program. TQP aims to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through enhanced preparation and professional development activities. The program supports traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs, with additional funding for school leadership activities. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million to support grants for school leadership activities. TQP grants are awarded to partnerships that include a high-need local educational agency, an institution of higher education, and a school or department of education within the institution. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires grantees to match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and collaborate with other federally funded programs. Grants support various reforms in teacher preparation programs and early childhood education, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education, induction programs, compensation initiatives, and professional development for teachers in high-need LEAs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grants for developing high-quality professional development for teachers in high-need LEAs, recruiting qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants also support teacher residency programs that offer rigorous graduate-level coursework and teaching apprenticeships, with mentor teachers selected based on effectiveness criteria. Programs place graduates in targeted schools for professional collaboration and provide a one-year living stipend or salary.

Programs place graduates in targeted schools for professional collaboration and provide a one-year living stipend or salary. Grants are also provided to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders, focusing on leadership skills, teacher support, data evaluation, resource management, parent and community engagement, and student learning. Grant funds are used for clinical education, mentoring, induction programs, and recruitment. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to enhance academic achievement by providing grants for professional development, mentoring, induction programs, and recruitment of qualified individuals into the teaching profession. Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) holds teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance data. States and institutions must issue report cards to the Department of Education (ED) and the public, with ED using this information to publish an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. Section 207 of the HEA mandates states to establish criteria for evaluating teacher preparation programs. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs using criteria such as teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Some states also considered student academic achievement, entry standards, professional development, and teacher qualifications. 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk programs, while 30 states and jurisdictions never reported any low-performing programs. In 2014, 45 teacher preparation programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of total programs. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved H.R. 4508, which would amend the Higher Education Act by repealing Title II provisions. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability measures. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has discussed HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. In March 2017, regulations were nullified that would have added clearer guidance on provider requirements. The new regulations would have also expanded accountability measures for institutions and states. The new regulations issued in October 2016 aimed to clarify provider requirements and enhance accountability measures for teacher preparation programs. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, focusing on the federal role in supporting program innovations and the quality of teacher preparation programs. Some argue for an expanded federal role to support quality programs more broadly. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program, with traditional routes emphasizing supervised clinical practice and assessments, and alternative routes seeking fewer restrictions on partners and more in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some argue for greater federal accountability in teacher preparation programs, citing low identification of low-performing programs. Others believe accountability should remain at the state and local level, as current reporting requirements are already burdensome."
