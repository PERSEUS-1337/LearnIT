    "content": "Feat2Vec is a method for estimating dense vector representations for multiple feature types in unstructured data, both in supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios. It outperforms other methods by enabling higher prediction accuracy and addressing the cold-start problem. Feat2Vec significantly outperforms existing algorithms in unsupervised learning by leveraging the structure of multiple feature types to create dense vector representations. These embeddings have advantages such as enabling more efficient training and unsupervised learning, and can be used for various prediction tasks. Word2Vec algorithms, like CBOW, are designed to provide embeddings useful for tasks like analogy solving and sentiment analysis. Feat2Vec is a novel method that allows calculating embeddings of arbitrary feature types from both supervised and unsupervised data, addressing limitations of existing algorithms in unsupervised learning. Feat2Vec is a new algorithm that can generate general-purpose embeddings for various feature types, unlike existing methods that are limited to specific types. It offers both unsupervised and supervised capabilities, allowing for flexible embeddings of different levels of abstraction, such as documents instead of just words. This method can also calculate embeddings for unseen items using alternative textual descriptions. Factorization Machine is a successful method for general-purpose factorization, extending polynomial regression to predict a target variable y from a vector of inputs x. It replaces individual pairwise parameters with a vector of parameters for each feature, encoding interactions between features. The dot product measures the similarity between latent factors of features, with n\u00d7r parameters compared to n 2 in polynomial regression. Feat2Vec extends the Factorization Machine model by allowing grouping of features and enabling arbitrary feature extraction functions. It introduces a framework for extending factorization machine with neural methods by defining feature groups where each group contains features of a particular type. Feat2Vec extends the Factorization Machine model by grouping features into feature groups and using a feature extraction function for each group. The interactions in Feat2Vec occur between different feature groups, allowing for a higher level of abstraction in reasoning. The feature extraction function \u03c6 i inputs the i-th feature group and returns an r-dimensional embedding. Feat2Vec extends the Factorization Machine model by grouping features into feature groups and using a feature extraction function for each group. The feature extraction function \u03c6 i allows for arbitrary processing of subfeatures, enabling entities to interact via the output of \u03c6 only. An example application involves grouping words in a document into a \"document\" feature group, with the extraction function \u03c6 capturing attributes of the document as a whole. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison between existing factorization methods and the novel model, showcasing Feat2Vec's use of multiple feature groups for embedding projection. The simplest implementation for \u03c6 i is a linear fully-connected layer. Feat2Vec extends the Factorization Machine model by grouping features into feature groups and using a feature extraction function for each group. The feature extraction function allows for arbitrary processing of subfeatures, enabling entities to interact via the output of \u03c6 only. Feat2Vec can be used to overcome the cold-start problem by treating words as indexed features within a structured feature group \u03ba w. This allows for precomputation and storage of latent factors for faster predictions during inference. Storing latent factors of the target task during training speeds up predictions during inference. Using neural networks in factorization machines replaces the dot product with a learned neural function, improving predictive accuracy but hindering interpretability. Feat2Vec can be combined with this approach, but it is not explored in this work. The neural function in factorization machines replaces the dot product, improving accuracy but reducing interpretability. Deep factorization models are trained using a loss function, with regularization controlled by a hyperparameter. For labeling and classification tasks, binary cross-entropy is optimized, while mean squared error is used for regression tasks. Models are built using the Keras toolkit, enabling automatic differentiation and optimization with ADAM algorithm. For multi-label classification tasks, Feat2Vec is used with a binary output, where one feature group represents the label to predict and the other group(s) are input features. Negative labels are sampled for each training example, with sampling strategies chosen based on validation error. Other sampling strategies have also been proposed. Feat2Vec can be used for unsupervised learning with no explicit target for prediction. The training dataset consists of observed data, such as documents. To provide negative examples, implicit sampling is used where a fixed number of negative labels are sampled for each positively labeled record. This approach is more efficient than using all possible negative labels, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Feat2Vec uses implicit sampling to provide negative examples for unsupervised learning. Unlike Word2Vec, it allows for learning correlations of features within a dataset by generating unobserved records as negative samples. Features groups can be individual columns in a data matrix, and by grouping subfeatures, the model can reason on more abstract entities in the data. For example, in experiments on a movie dataset, a \"genre\" feature group is used to group indicators for movie genres like comedy, action, and drama films. Feat2Vec uses implicit sampling to provide negative examples for unsupervised learning. It iterates over observations in the training dataset, randomly selecting a feature group from a noise distribution to create negative observations. This method allows for learning correlations of features within a dataset by generating unobserved records as negative samples. Feat2Vec uses implicit sampling to provide negative examples for unsupervised learning by selecting feature groups from a noise distribution to create negative observations. The complexity of a feature extraction function determines the sampling probabilities of each feature group, with more weight given to features with more parameters. The hyper-parameter \u03b1 1 influences the sampling rate of feature groups based on their complexity. Sampling values within feature groups \u03ba i is done using an empirical distribution method similar to Word2Vec. This method may generate some negatively labeled samples, which can be handled by either ignoring duplicate negative samples or adjusting the probability. In unsupervised learning of embeddings, the NCE loss function is optimized to account for random negative labels that may appear identical to positive ones. The burden of NCE includes calculating a partition function for each unique record type to transform the probability of positive or negative labels into a well-behaved distribution. The NCE loss function in unsupervised learning of embeddings involves transforming the probability of positive or negative labels into a well-behaved distribution. Setting Zx=1 in advance does not significantly affect model performance, as it will learn the probabilities itself. The new structural probability model optimizes parameters while considering the probability of negative samples. Feat2Vec optimizes the parameters of feature extraction functions while accounting for negative samples. It can be used as a multi-label classifier, with each feature type optimizing a different target label. The approach involves optimizing a convex combination of loss functions from individual Factorization Machines. The study evaluates supervised embeddings using a development set and a 10% test set, with early stopping for validation. The study uses a development set and a 10% test set for experiments on embeddings. Results are reported on a single training-test split for a multi-label classification task, using AUC as the evaluation metric. Sampling negative labels based on label frequency helps prevent bias, although there is a small chance of underestimating model performance. The consistent use of AUC allows for meaningful comparison across methods and baselines. In experiments, AUC is used as the evaluation metric for classification and ranking tasks, while mean squared error (MSE) is used for regression. Regularization was found to slow convergence without improving accuracy, so only early stopping is used to prevent overfitting. Feature extraction for text is done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Feat2Vec is compared with Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) on the CiteULike dataset. Feat2Vec is compared with Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) on the CiteULike dataset. CTR shows degradation in performance for unseen documents, while Feat2Vec achieves a higher AUC on both warm-start and unseen conditions. Feat2Vec can also be trained over ten times faster and has potential for further optimization. Feat2Vec is compared with DeepCoNN, a state-of-the-art method for predicting customer ratings using textual reviews. Feat2Vec outperforms DeepCoNN on the Yelp dataset, showing a significant improvement in mean squared error over Matrix Factorization. Feat2Vec is more general and efficient, utilizing three feature groups for item identifiers, users, and review text. Our approach, Feat2Vec, is claimed to be more efficient and general compared to DeepCoNN. It duplicates text multiple times per training epoch, making it more efficient for large datasets. To evaluate the performance of our unsupervised embedding algorithm, we conduct a ranking task using unseen records. We compare the performance of Feat2Vec to Word2Vec's CBOW algorithm by assessing the cosine similarity of trained embeddings. In our evaluation approach, we compare cosine similarity of embeddings of entities known to be associated by appearing in the same observation in a test dataset. For warm-start, we use cf-train-1-items.dat, and for cold-start predictions, we use ofm-train-1-items.dat. Feat2Vec and MF were trained on an Nvidia K80 GPU, while CTR was trained on a Xeon E5-2666 v3 CPU. We also compare movie directors to actors in the same film and evaluate textbook rankings based on similarity of embeddings, measured by mean percentile rank (MPR). The curr_chunk discusses the use of datasets from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and a leading technology company for educational services. It mentions the features used in the datasets and the prediction of movie directors based on cast members. The chunk also highlights the experimental setup details provided in the appendix. Feat2Vec outperforms CBOW in predicting movie directors based on cast members, achieving a Top-1 Precision metric of 2.43% compared to CBOW's 1.26%. The distribution of rankings is explored in detail in the appendix. Feat2Vec's performance on real-valued features with complex extraction functions showcases its advantage over token-based algorithms like Word2Vec. Feat2Vec's advantage over Word2Vec lies in its ability to extract embeddings of numerically similar ratings, resulting in closer proximity between similar ratings. The evaluation involves predicting movie ratings by comparing IMDB rating embeddings with director embeddings. Varying the flattening hyperparameter \u03b11 affects performance, with lower values improving rating embeddings but potentially reducing the quality of director embeddings. The experiment results are compared against Word2Vec's CBOW algorithm. Feat2Vec outperforms Word2Vec's CBOW algorithm in predicting movie ratings, with results showing consistent performance across hyper-parameter settings. The original Factorization Machine formulation has been extended for multiple contexts, but Feat2Vec allows for feature groups and extraction functions not found in other algorithms. Various algorithms have been proposed for generating continuous representations of entities such as biological sequences, network graphs, and complete sentences, with Generative Adversarial Networks being used for producing unsupervised embeddings of images for classification. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for unsupervised embeddings of images and natural language. GANs have not been used for jointly embedding multiple feature types. Adversarial training could be an alternative for unsupervised learning. A new algorithm called StarSpace aims to embed all types of features but is limited to bag of words. Feat2Vec can learn embeddings for all feature values, while StarSpace samples a single feature which may not generalize well. Limitation includes not comparing with StarSpace. Feat2Vec is a general-purpose method that decouples feature extraction from prediction for datasets with multiple feature types. In supervised settings, it outperforms algorithms designed specifically for text, even with the same feature extraction CNN. In unsupervised settings, Feat2Vec's embeddings can capture relationships across features better than Word2Vec's CBOW algorithm. It exploits dataset structure to learn embeddings in a more sensible way than existing methods. Feat2Vec is a method that decouples feature extraction from prediction for datasets with multiple feature types. It outperforms algorithms designed for text in supervised settings and captures relationships across features better than Word2Vec's CBOW algorithm in unsupervised settings. Future work includes reducing the amount of human knowledge required and evaluating Feat2Vec on different datasets. In an unsupervised ranking experiment, a testing set was defined for evaluation without tuning model parameters. The dataset included observations with directors appearing at least twice, ensuring each algorithm learned about these directors. Cross-validation was performed on the loss function for Feat2Vec and CBOW, with regularization not significantly impacting results. Entity pairs in the test dataset were ranked based on cosine similarity. In unsupervised experiments, entity pairs in the test dataset are ranked based on cosine similarity. Different embeddings are learned for the IMDB and educational datasets using Feat2Vec and CBOW algorithms with specific hyperparameters. Word2Vec is used to create documents for each observation in the datasets. In Feat2Vec, feature values are prepended with their names and spaces are removed. Features with multiple values are truncated to 10 levels. Padding is used to maintain fixed length. CBOW Word2Vec algorithm is employed for training. Unique embeddings are learned for categorical variables without one-hot encodings. Feat2Vec allows for multiple categories to be active without requiring one-hot encodings, resulting in a single embedding for the group. Text is preprocessed by removing non alpha-numeric characters, stopwords, and stemming words. Real-valued features are passed through a 3-layer feedforward neural network to output a vector of dimension r. This highlights one advantage of Feat2Vec: using numeric values as inputs. The Feat2Vec algorithm utilizes real-valued features in an intermediate layer with r units and relu activation functions. It can learn a highly nonlinear relation mapping a real number to a high-dimensional embedding space. The algorithm outperforms CBOW in extracting rankings, especially in the lower ranking space, but CBOW is superior in the upper tail of rankings. However, in the absolute upper region of rankings (1 to 25), Feat2Vec still outperforms CBOW until rank 8. Feat2Vec outperforms CBOW in lower rankings, especially up to rank 8. The algorithm excels in extracting information for entities that appear sparsely in the training data. The gradient for learning embeddings with Feat2Vec is a convex combination of gradients from targeted Factorization Machines for each feature in the dataset. The algorithm Feat2Vec excels in extracting information for entities that appear sparsely in the training data. The loss function is a convex combination of targeted classifiers for each feature, with weights based on feature group sampling probabilities. The feature extraction network used for labeling tasks consists of 1000 convolutional filters with a width of 3 words. The feature extraction function \u03c6 used in supervised tasks involves building a vocabulary from common words, converting text to one-hot encodings, and passing it through layers including an embedding layer and convolutional filters. The text discusses the application of convolutional filters on word embeddings to extract features from text inputs. Filters are applied using a sliding window, and 1-max pooling is used to select the maximum value from the output vector. A fully connected layer with ReLU activation is then used to learn higher-level features. Dropout regularization is applied during training to prevent overfitting. The text discusses the application of convolutional filters on word embeddings to extract features from text inputs. Dropout regularization is applied during training to prevent overfitting, with a dropout layer randomly dropping units. The final embedding for x j is computed by a dense layer with r output units and an activation function. The architecture uses 1,000 convolutional filters and a dropout rate of 0.1, with PReLU activations for the final layer in the CTR dataset. The CNN architecture for DeepCoNN uses PReLU activations for the final layer to prevent units from 'dying' during training. Hyper-parameters include 100 convolution filters, 50 units for the fully connected layer, word embedding size of 100, vocabulary size of 100,000, and maximum document length of 250. Feat2Vec is compared with Collaborative Topic Regression using embedding sizes of 5, 10, and 15, with results shown in TAB2.2."
