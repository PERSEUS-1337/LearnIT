The Coastal Barrier Resources Act allows for voluntary additions to the System, with specific criteria for inclusion. Technical amendments are made regarding the addition of excess property. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act is amended to include a notice requirement for additions to the System, including publishing in the Federal Register, providing maps to relevant parties, and updating existing maps. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act is amended to include a notice requirement for additions to the System, with revisions to maps reflecting the added property. SEC. 3. CLERICAL AMENDMENTS. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act is amended by repealing certain sections. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 12 is redesignated as section 10 with authorization of appropriations. SEC. 5. DIGITAL MAPPING PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with FEMA, will conduct a pilot project to create digital versions of Coastal Barrier Resources System maps. Existing digital spatial data will be used from agencies like USGS and NOAA for at least 5 units of the System. The head of any Federal agency with digital spatial data must provide it to the Secretary at no cost. If necessary data is missing, an agreement with the US Geological Survey Director will be made to obtain the required data. All digital spatial data used must comply with established standards. The Geographic Data Committee was established by the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-16. A report must be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives within 2 years, detailing the results of a pilot project and the feasibility, data needs, and costs of completing digital maps for the entire System. The report should include information on cooperative agreements with other Federal agencies, existing data availability, and the need for additional data. The pilot project aims to complete digital mapping of the entire System, focusing on data availability and funding needs. $500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002 for this purpose. SEC. 6. Corrections to maps for unit P19-P to align with previous depictions. The Secretary of the Interior must make necessary corrections within 30 days of enactment to ensure consistency with the map dated September 16, 1998. SEC. 7.

The Secretary of the Interior will keep these maps available for inspection. The Secretary of the Interior must make corrections to the map to adjust the boundary of the protected area to exclude leased property and include a specific area of Cape Henlopen State Park. The map in question is part of the Coastal Barrier Resources System related to the Cape Henlopen Unit DE-03P. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 21, 1999."
