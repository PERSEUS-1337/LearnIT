    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. The Act \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" outlines findings regarding the global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems posing a threat to national security. The use of these weapons by terrorists hampers peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proliferation of tactical missile systems threatens international peace and security. The Government Accountability Office estimates 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries no longer need these weapons for security but lack the means to eliminate or safeguard them. The United States lacks a program to promote conventional arms threat reduction and eliminate tactical missiles in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for this purpose since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. There should be a focus on combating the proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and light weapons due to their links with global terrorism networks. The United States has a strong focus on combating the proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems as part of its nonproliferation strategy. The United States aims to assist other countries in safeguarding or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat through a global program. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and assistance in safe handling and storage of these weapons. Cooperation with international organizations like NATO is also part of the program. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This includes activities such as safe handling, proper storage, and elimination of these weapons, as well as managing them at locations where US funds have been used for security. Actions are taken to ensure equipment and funds are used for authorized purposes. SEC. 5. OFFICE OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. An Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction is established within the Department of State to formulate policy and administer programs for reducing conventional arms threats. SEC. 6. REPORT ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. The Secretary of State must submit a report on conventional arms threat reduction to congressional committees within 180 days of this Act. The report includes details on past State Department efforts, progress of the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, and a country-by-country overview of efforts to eliminate or safeguard conventional weapons. The report required by the Secretary of State on conventional arms threat reduction must include an evaluation of the integration of US activities with other programs in countries receiving assistance, as well as a description of US programs related to the elimination of tactical missile systems. The report will be in unclassified form, with the possibility of a classified annex. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $50,000,000 authorized for the President in fiscal year 2005. Limitation: $10,000,000 cannot be obligated until report submission. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific Senate and House committees, \"Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund\" as a fund established under a certain Act, and \"small arms and light weapons\" as various types of firearms and ammunition. The curr_chunk mentions various types of ammunition and explosives, including cartridges, rounds, hand grenades, landmines, and explosives."
