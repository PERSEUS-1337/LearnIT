It is equipped with advanced computers and communications for a leading role in the digital battlespace. Originally intended to replace older Army helicopters, budget constraints led to modifications, reducing the procurement objective to 1,292 armed reconnaissance helicopters. The RAH-66 Comanche program underwent several changes, including the cancellation of the utility transport version and a reduction in the number of armed reconnaissance helicopters to 1,292. Budget constraints led to delays in production decisions and a decrease in the number of prototypes. The program was restructured in 1995 to include 6 experimental operational capability helicopters. Boeing-Sikorsky built and flew two prototypes, with a third expected to fly in March 2005. The plan included building five pre-production aircraft and delivering eight production aircraft by 2004 for testing. A total of 14 initial operational capability RAH-66s were planned for delivery by the end of 2006. The RAH-66 Comanche program underwent restructuring in 2002, reducing the total purchase of aircraft from 1,213 to 650. Initial Operating Capability was delayed to September 2009, with 73 aircraft to be produced during Low Rate Initial Production. The remaining 577 aircraft would be produced at a rate of 60 per year starting in 2011, instead of the desired 96 per year to cut costs. The Army restructured the RAH-66 Comanche program in 2011 to reduce costs, with plans to increase production to 96 aircraft per year. The program faced challenges due to concurrent development of various systems. The restructuring delayed the fielding of certain capabilities and included the development of a companion UAV for the Comanche. The Army restructured the RAH-66 Comanche program in 2011 to reduce costs and increase production to 96 aircraft per year. Plans include developing a companion UAV for the Comanche, with funds intended for upgrades being redirected to UAV development. Comanche officials estimate $644 million will be spent on the UAV between fiscal years 2004 and 2009. Army officials aim to equip their Objective Force with 819 Comanches by 2008, along with detachments of 12 Comanche aircraft and eight UAVs. The RAH-66 Comanche program was restructured in 2011 to reduce costs and increase production. Critics argue that the highly sophisticated helicopter is unnecessary in today's threat environment and its capabilities are too similar to the AH-64 Apache. The DoD's Inspector General praised the restructuring but cautioned that continued emphasis is needed to prevent integration problems in the future. Critics argue that the RAH-66 Comanche's role and capabilities are too similar to the AH-64 Apache's, leading to the decision to cancel the program. They suggest using the savings to upgrade other aircraft instead. Proponents of the RAH-66 highlight its reduced radar signature but critics point out that current threats do not rely on radar for targeting. Supporters argue that Comanche would enhance Army aviation in low-intensity conflicts and make the force more effective and versatile. Initial results from an Army study support this perspective. The RAH-66 Comanche demonstrated better situational awareness, survivability, and lethality compared to other units. It provided improved sensing, lethality, range, agility, survivability, and versatility. The Comanche also enhanced the effectiveness of the Longbow in attack units. Claims of reduced maintenance burdens for the Comanche are controversial, with projected maintenance ratios being optimistic according to the General Accounting Office and Congressional Budget Office. The General Accounting Office and Congressional Budget Office question the optimistic projections for maintenance reductions on the RAH-66 Comanche. Studies show it is more expensive to fly than the Kiowa Warrior but less expensive than the AH-64D Apache. The role of the Comanche compared to the Apache is debated, with the Army considering upgrades to the Apache due to reductions in the Comanche program. There are discussions on whether the Comanche should pursue certain features and if it will be upgraded for heavy attack requirements. Army officials had planned a heavy variant of the RAH-66 as a replacement for the AH-64D. In November 2001, Army officials planned a heavy variant of the RAH-66 Comanche as a replacement for the AH-64D, with discussions on its ability to maintain stealth while carrying external weapons. The Marine Corps is expected to seek a replacement for its AH-1Z Super Cobra helicopters around 2020, potentially through a joint program with the Army. Congress has consistently supported the Comanche program by meeting or exceeding DoD's budget requests for funding. The Comanche program has received consistent funding support from Congress. The Army's only major aviation development program, Comanche's contribution to future warfighting missions includes increased deployability, versatility, and lethality. With $6.8 billion spent on R&D through FY03, questions arise about the return on investment from a purchase of 650 helicopters. The impact of reducing the Comanche buy on long-term capabilities and its combat power compared to the Army's light armored vehicles is also a concern. Some argue that the Comanche may not be the most effective provider of Close Air Support compared to other aircraft like the AC-130 or A-10. However, others believe that the Comanche could replace the Apache as the Army's premier attack helicopter. The potential helicopter force structure could consist of heavy lift, battlefield utility, and scout/attack aircraft. Export issues and the contribution of Comanche exports to the aviation industrial base are also important considerations. Export issues are crucial for any military program. The potential contribution of Comanche exports to the aviation industrial base and balancing U.S. trade is a key consideration. The question arises whether the Comanche, being less designed for attack than the Apache, could be offered for export to more countries. However, due to its low observable features, limitations on Comanche exports to only close allies may be necessary. The curr_chunk discusses various articles related to the Comanche acquisition decision, program updates, and potential impacts on the aviation industry. The AH-64D Longbow is mentioned as an upgraded version of the AH-64A. The curr_chunk discusses the latest Comanche development plan, highlighting reduced program risk. The AH-64D Longbow is an upgraded version of the AH-64A with advanced features. Claims of improved maintenance requirements are based on projections of advanced technologies. The article also mentions the potential replacement of the Apache with the Comanche. The curr_chunk provides references related to the Comanche helicopter program, including cost issues, procurement cuts, and legislative documents."
