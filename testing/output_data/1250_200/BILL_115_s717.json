    "content": "The \"POWER Act\" aims to address high rates of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by providing pro bono legal services. Efforts are needed at all levels to combat this violence and its harmful effects on society. Research has shown that providing pro bono legal assistance to victims of domestic violence can help prevent future violence and aid in obtaining protective orders. Legal representation increases the likelihood of obtaining a protective order, reducing the risk of further harm to victims and their families. The American Bar Association Model Rules emphasize the importance of lawyers providing pro bono legal services to those in need. Judges should encourage attorneys to offer pro bono resources to help victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. This dedicated effort will raise awareness and empower survivors in communities. District courts will host empowerment events in partnership with domestic violence service providers and volunteer lawyer projects to promote pro bono legal services for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. This initiative aims to empower survivors and engage citizens in assisting them, especially in districts containing Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Each chief judge, in partnership with Indian tribes or tribal organizations, must lead a public event promoting pro bono legal services for Native American victims of domestic violence. They have discretion in organizing the events to maximize local impact and access to legal services. Additionally, each chief judge must submit a report to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts by October 30 each year. Each chief judge must submit a report detailing public events under section 3 by October 30 each year. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will compile and summarize these reports for Congress by January 1 annually. Funding for this Act will be covered by existing funds. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \n\"Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States.\""
