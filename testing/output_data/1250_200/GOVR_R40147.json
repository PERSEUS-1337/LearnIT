    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as a significant source of environmental impact due to resource consumption, waste production, and direct effects on occupants. This includes electricity usage, water consumption, and the use of construction materials with complex supply chains. Buildings have significant environmental and financial costs, accounting for 40% of energy consumption in the US and producing 40% of greenhouse gas emissions. Their location affects stormwater management and transportation energy use. Indoor air quality impacts occupant health and productivity. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in buildings, improving indoor air quality and reducing pollutants. It has gained interest since the 1990s, involving various stakeholders like construction firms, building owners, lawmakers, and government agencies. The report discusses green building, federal policies, and programs related to it, including its definition, environmental impact areas, tools for compliance, implementation issues, and key authorities. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s, with organizations like the American Institute of Architects and the U.S. Green Building Council playing significant roles. The \"Greening of the White House\" project was a notable federal green building initiative in that decade. The concept of green building has evolved from the \"Greening of the White House\" project in the 1990s to encompass environmentally conscious design principles and practices aimed at reducing harmful impacts of the built environment. Green building efforts vary along a design and performance continuum, with some focusing on greatly reducing environmental impacts, such as zero-impact or minus-impact buildings, while others may use the term as a marketing tool, known as \"greenwashing.\" Green building is an integrated approach to design, construction, and operations that reduces the environmental footprint of buildings. It is a relative concept, aiming for greener than average structures through various techniques and strategies. This approach can be applied to any type of building, seeking improvements in environmental performance. Green building techniques, including innovative technologies and design features, are often decided in the design phase to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings. The terms green building and sustainable building are used interchangeably, with sustainable building aiming for smaller environmental footprints to not hinder future human activity and ecosystems. Green building, also known as high-performance building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. Federal definitions emphasize attributes like energy efficiency, durability, safety, and sustainability. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 provides a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 refined the concept of high-performance green buildings by establishing a detailed definition. Descriptions of green building focus on elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting. Siting has gained prominence in recent years, considering transportation, ecology, and smart growth. Objectives for high-performance buildings include serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster resilience, and climate resilience. The goals of green building projects vary based on stakeholders' needs, including occupants. Local factors like climate zone and flood risk influence design priorities. Energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, energy storage, and smart-grid innovations are key elements in green building. Energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, energy storage, and smart-grid innovations are crucial elements in green building. Studies show that buildings can achieve significant energy savings through energy efficiency measures. Federal law mandates reductions in energy use by federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. However, energy consumption in 2015 still exceeded the federal goal. While energy is important in green building, it should not be the sole focus as other factors also play a role in creating sustainable buildings. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in water resource management, especially in arid areas. Techniques include using reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, recycling wastewater, and implementing landscaping to reduce irrigation needs. Water management also involves handling rain, on-site water, and run-off, with low-impact development focusing on natural and engineered techniques to control stormwater. The choice and use of materials in building construction can significantly impact the environmental footprint, with environmentally preferable products reducing resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials may have recycled content, be biobased, or produced with low energy and pollutant levels. Debate exists on what defines environmentally preferable materials due to inconsistent vocabulary and measurement standards. The lack of consistent vocabulary and measurement standards for environmentally preferable materials can make it challenging to determine their sustainability. Waste reduction efforts in building construction include source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy methods. Landscaping and efficient boilers can also help mitigate environmental impacts. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, impacted by factors like ventilation, air filtration, and materials used. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes lighting, climate control, acoustics, and design. Building location can affect environmental footprint, with proximity to transportation hubs reducing reliance on private vehicles. Site selection considers ecological sensitivity to minimize impacts. Green buildings aim to reduce impacts from private vehicles by utilizing public transportation hubs. Site selection considers ecological sensitivity to minimize adverse effects on ecological services and native species. Building orientation and proximity to trees affect heating and cooling requirements. Climate-related risks like sea-level rise and extreme weather events are increasingly important in coastal areas. Productivity and utility are key elements of green building, with indoor environmental quality influencing worker comfort and productivity. Green buildings focus on improving worker comfort and productivity through indoor environmental quality (IEQ). While green buildings can enhance productivity, there are instances where trade-offs occur, such as poor acoustic performance. Serviceability, resilience to hazards, and climate-resilient design are key considerations in high-performance buildings. Strategies for resilience include resistant construction, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling capabilities. Green building emphasizes climate-resilient design through features like photovoltaic and wind-turbine technology, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Integration across elements and stages is key to improving performance and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of overall environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and development of an integrated strategy, with the use of information technology enhancing integration and performance. The appropriate use of information technology in building operations can enhance integration and performance across various elements. Balancing energy efficiency with health considerations is crucial, as focusing solely on one aspect can lead to counterproductive outcomes. A green building approach forces an examination of how actions affecting each element impact others, allowing for overall optimization. However, in some cases, only addressing a few factors may be feasible, and prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or environmental factors. A green building approach allows for an assessment of how actions affecting each element impact others, facilitating overall optimization. Choices made during construction need to be balanced with planning for the postoccupancy stage to address energy efficiency and occupant health considerations. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or environmental factors. The development of rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes in the building sector in the 1990s helped standardize and define green building practices, addressing the complexity of determining whether a building is green or sustainable. Rating and certification systems in the building sector, such as LEED, assign points to buildings based on green design criteria, resulting in an overall score and certification validation. Independent third parties conduct assessments to ensure objectivity. Multiple organizations offer these services for green buildings. The most prevalent certification system for green buildings in the United States is LEED, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in 1998. LEED has become a widely recognized benchmark for green building design, with over 37,300 commercial buildings certified worldwide as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories, including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. Certification is also available for the operation and maintenance of existing buildings, with a five-year recertification cycle. LEED focuses on six primary green building elements. LEED certification system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is the most prevalent for green buildings in the United States. It focuses on six green building elements and has a five-year recertification cycle. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a designated number of points for optional items to be certified. The total score determines the level of certification: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. LEED v4, the most recent version, was released in November 2013. Other certification systems in the U.S. include The Building. The LEED certification system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is the most prevalent for green buildings in the United States. LEED v4, released in November 2013, focuses on six green building elements and has a five-year recertification cycle. Other rating systems in the U.S. include BREEAM, which offers BREEAM In-Use certification for existing commercial buildings. BREEAM ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding and are based on nine impact categories. Green Globes, developed in Canada, is based on BREEAM and has its own standard. Green Globes, developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, is based on BREEAM and offers certification based on points earned across six elements. Points are distributed across site, energy, water, materials, emissions, indoor environment, and project management. Certification is solely based on the number of points earned, with no mandatory provisions. The Living Building Challenge by the International Living Future Institute offers three certifications based on performance areas known as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, while Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals, including water. The Living Building Challenge offers different certifications based on performance areas called \"Petals,\" including water, energy, and materials. Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, with Petal Certification needing compliance with at least three Petals. Unlike other rating systems, Living Building Certification also includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Various green certification systems emphasize different aspects of green building, with some focusing on new construction and others on existing buildings. Additional programs exist to certify environmental performance in specific areas, such as Energy Star for energy efficiency and Indoor airPLUS for indoor air quality. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, with some agencies using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends the use of third-party green certification systems, as they simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and provide a recognizable label to communicate sustainability efforts within the agency and to the public. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends using third-party green certification systems to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, identifies a certification system every five years, with LEED or Green Globes recommended for federal agencies. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking sets minimum criteria for green building certification systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and cities require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced model building codes, while building codes are often mandatory. This section discusses comprehensive green building codes and standards addressing multiple elements. Green building codes go beyond minimum requirements for building design and construction, addressing environmental design and performance. They can be incorporated into mandatory codes or laws at the state and local level, often adopting national model codes. These codes are sometimes referred to as \"beyond-code\" options. Green building model codes exceed minimum building code requirements and can be mandatory or voluntary. Technical standards for specific components are created by recognized standards development organizations. Buildings meeting a standard may be certified as having met the criteria. Specific requirements may be achievable through prescriptive or performance pathways. Green building standards, including codes and standards, offer multiple pathways for achieving requirements. Prescriptive pathways detail specific methods, while performance pathways allow flexibility as long as end results meet requirements. Outcome-based requirements set performance targets verified post-construction. These standards are developed through a consensus process and may be adopted by jurisdictions. Accreditation by bodies like ANSI ensures adherence to approved procedures, with certification typically done by a third party. The two main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the US are... The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which includes sustainability measures for the entire construction project and its site. The IgCC can be adopted alongside the full family of ICC codes and offers various compliance pathways for municipalities to adjust requirements based on local factors. The IgCC covers most building types, excluding low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have jointly released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, offering requirements in site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been incorporated into Department of Defense building requirements. In 2015, the ICC and ASHRAE announced a partnership to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Several federal laws and policy instruments have provisions related to green building, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. EPACT 2005 aimed to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015 and promote energy-efficient products procurement by federal agencies. EPACT 2005 established energy efficiency standards for federal buildings, state energy conservation plans, and residential appliances. It authorized funding for rebate programs, public building energy improvements, and incentives for building energy codes. The act also created the Energy Star labeling program and set energy and water conservation standards for various products. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts, including energy efficiency standards for appliances and lighting. It also required energy-efficient lighting in GSA leased facilities and set requirements for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established energy efficiency standards for residential, commercial, and federal buildings. It increased funding for DOE's program to assist low-income families with weatherization and required a feasibility study of state rebate programs. EISA also mandated more stringent energy goals for federal buildings, including a 65% reduction in energy consumption by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. Title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set energy efficiency standards for new construction and renovations, aiming for a 65% reduction in energy consumption by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. It required green building certification, water conservation guidelines, and stormwater runoff requirements. Agencies must commission new building equipment to operate efficiently, plan for maintenance, and track energy and water savings. Federal buildings need advanced metering devices and energy benchmarking. The act also mandated regular evaluations of energy and water use, extended the assessment period to 40 years, and promoted energy-efficient equipment and technologies in GSA facilities. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set energy efficiency standards for new construction and renovations, aiming for a 65% reduction in energy consumption by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. It required green building certification, water conservation guidelines, and stormwater runoff requirements. The act also established an Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings within GSA to coordinate and facilitate the development of energy-efficient buildings in the federal sector. It mandated regular evaluations of energy and water use, extended the assessment period to 40 years, and promoted energy-efficient equipment and technologies in GSA facilities. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directed GSA to develop model leasing provisions to encourage energy efficiency in buildings. It also provided funding for green retrofits of housing and public schools, as well as energy-efficiency improvements to various agencies' buildings. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions to encourage energy and water efficiency measures in commercial buildings. It also includes provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces, collecting occupant energy-use information, developing a Tenant Star recognition label, and establishing energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions for energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It includes provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces, developing a Tenant Star recognition label, and establishing energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters. President Obama's Executive Order 13693 sets new sustainability goals for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025, including reducing building energy intensity and potable water consumption intensity, increasing clean energy usage, and maintaining a public database of energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. President Obama's Executive Order 13693, issued in 2015, set sustainability goals for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025. These goals include reducing potable water consumption intensity, increasing clean energy usage, and ensuring new buildings are designed for net-zero energy, water, and waste by FY2030. The order also called for climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings and compliance with the \"Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance Sustainable Buildings.\" Compliance efforts led to an 18% increase in federal sustainable buildings between FY2014 and FY2015. Between FY2014 and FY2015, representatives of federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding titled \"Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings,\" which included core Guiding Principles for green building design. The federal government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the United States, costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policies require federal agencies to implement green building practices. The federal government owns or leases nearly 3 billion square feet of building space, costing $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policies mandate green building practices for federal agencies. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings, requiring LEED certification for new construction and major renovations. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages federal building space and mandates green building practices. GSA requires LEED certification for new construction and renovations. By 2020, all new buildings will aim for net-zero energy, water, or waste. GSA's Green Proving Ground program evaluates next-generation building technologies for deployment. Various GSA offices contribute to green building efforts, including the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings. This office coordinates activities across federal agencies and provides actionable information to improve building performance.

GSA participates in climate adaptation planning and has developed sustainable design principles for the federal government. GSA also collaborated with other agencies to develop FITWEL, a voluntary certification program promoting occupant health and wellness in workplaces. The Department of Energy's green building activities focus on the energy element through various offices like the Building Technologies Office and the Federal Energy Management Program. The Building Technologies Office (BTO) under the Department of Energy focuses on improving energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings. Their goal is to achieve a 50% reduction in energy use intensity by 2020. BTO's programs include Building America, which aims to improve energy savings in residential buildings, and the Commercial Buildings Integration program. They are also working on developing cost-effective net-zero energy buildings.

They also promote safer chemicals through R&D programs and indoor air quality protection. Additionally, the EPA provides resources for smart growth and sustainability initiatives, including green building policies for local governments. The Department of Defense (DOD) has the largest building footprint in the federal government, with over 276,000 buildings covering 2.2 billion square feet worldwide. DOD issues requirements for its buildings under the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) program, including green building standards outlined in UFC 1-200-02 and UFC 3-210-10. The Department of Defense (DOD) mandates compliance with green building standards outlined in UFC 3-210-10 for new construction and major renovations. The DOD also sets goals for sustainability through its Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP) and branch-wide initiatives, such as the Army's Net Zero Installations project and the Air Force's Sustainability Development Indicators. The Air Force uses Sustainability Development Indicators to ensure that installation development plans consider environmental impact areas. DOD and EPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement sustainable military installations and promote innovative technologies. The position of Federal Chief Sustainability Officer was established in 1993 and expanded to include green building requirements. NIST's green building efforts are housed in NIST's Engineering Laboratory. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focuses on green building efforts through its Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Manufacturing, Materials, and Infrastructure Program. This program aims to improve measurement science for intelligent building systems, sustainable materials, and achieving net-zero energy buildings with high indoor air quality. NIST has developed the Net-Zero Energy High-Performance Buildings Program and the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility to work towards building sustainability and energy efficiency. Additionally, NIST has created the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software tool to aid in selecting environmentally preferable building products. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focuses on green building efforts through its Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Manufacturing, Materials, and Infrastructure Program.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers programs like the Mark-to-Market program and the Energy Efficient Mortgage Program to encourage green building elements in public housing. HUD also provides funding for energy and water efficiency improvements in Public Housing Agencies. The rise of green building has raised questions about its impacts, including market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The building industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016, accounting for over 6% of GDP. HUD administers programs for energy and water efficiency improvements in Public Housing Agencies. The green building market in the United States has grown significantly, with spending exceeding $1 trillion and accounting for over 6% of GDP. The percentage of construction devoted to green building has increased, reaching 20% in 2013 from just 2% in 2005. Green construction spending has tripled from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014, with projections of generating $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction is expected to drive future growth, especially due to certification requirements for public buildings and schools. The rise in certified-green floorspace is evident, with a significant increase in office space certified by LEED or Energy Star. However, a large portion of U.S. buildings still do not meet green criteria, making retrofitting challenging. Green building efforts impact financial performance through construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The true costs of implementing green measures are not always clear, leading to distorted perceptions of economic benefits. Researchers have found that the financial performance of green building investments is limited due to perceived higher initial costs. These costs can stem from features like high-efficiency appliances and design expenses. However, evidence suggests that the construction costs of green buildings are not substantially higher than standard buildings. The construction costs for green buildings are comparable to those of conventional buildings, with potential reductions in initial costs through integrated design. Proponents argue that operational cost savings, such as reduced utility expenses and selling renewable energy back to the grid, can offset any higher initial investment. Studies show that green certification is linked to lower utility costs, but evidence is mixed on whether it reduces overall operating expenses. Green certification may not significantly reduce overall operating expenses for commercial buildings, but evidence suggests that green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market. However, challenges such as the turnover of building owners and tenants can limit the financial benefits of green building investments. This split-incentive problem may hinder the potential beneficiaries of green building renovations. Many potential beneficiaries of green building renovations may face constraints on capital availability, especially in sectors like educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers may decrease as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives helping to make investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept emphasizes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones when evaluating green building efforts. In evaluating green building efforts, it is important to distinguish between design and performance. While much focus has been on design and construction specifications, the actual environmental performance of green buildings is not always incorporated into certification requirements. Factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use can impact a building's performance post-occupancy. This raises questions about whether a certified green building will perform significantly better or worse than a conventional one. Certified green buildings can be resource-intensive post-occupancy. Studies show that green building efforts may reduce energy-use intensity, but larger homes with more appliances use more total energy. There is often a performance gap between predicted and actual energy use in green buildings, leading to ongoing concerns in the construction industry. Rating systems now focus more on post-occupancy performance assessment to address these issues. Rating systems are increasingly emphasizing postoccupancy performance assessment to address concerns about green building efficiency. Revisions to the LEED rating system now require building-level energy and water meters to be installed and data reported to USGBC for five years post-certification. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification include performance parameters in their criteria. Building codes are also incorporating performance outcomes, such as the 2015 IgCC's outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage. Commissioning building systems can improve environmental performance, especially for energy use, and can be applied to both new and existing buildings. Commissioning improves environmental performance, especially for energy use in buildings. It can be applied to new or existing buildings during retrofitting or operations. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification. Performance measurement in EMS can help meet commitments to improve environmental performance and prevent pollution. Building monitoring tools like GSAlink can detect faults in equipment and provide resource use analytics for effective response to changing patterns in real time. Studies have shown mixed evidence on the performance of green buildings compared to conventional ones. Some green buildings perform below design expectations, with a wide range of energy performance. LEED-certified buildings, on average, perform 24% better than others, but about one in seven perform worse. A study of energy use in over 100 LEED-certified buildings in the U.S. market found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings. However, about one in seven performed worse. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines for comparison. Another assessment using the same data concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. Additionally, a GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which were LEED-certified, showed better performance than the national average in various areas. However, some buildings performed worse in certain aspects. A study of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings found that 9 did not meet the federal requirement for electricity savings. The study found that 9 out of 11 buildings did not meet the federal requirement for electricity savings, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. Assessments of LEED-certified buildings in Arizona revealed underperformance compared to energy-use simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive evaluations, highlighting the need for greater access to building performance data for more accurate assessments. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and improving them. However, methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements. Some, like energy and water use, are easy to measure quantitatively, while others may require qualitative evaluation. Disagreements may arise on which metrics are most relevant, such as energy use intensity (EUI). The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring EUI. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. Accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are essential for maintaining environmental performance over time. Eventually, a standard life-cycle assessment may be feasible for whole buildings. Federal agencies are required by EISA to measure the performance of their buildings. The EISA requires federal agencies to measure building performance against energy use targets, with more stringent goals for new construction. Challenges exist in determining accurate baseline consumption levels and obtaining reliable data. Measurement science for green building is a priority for research and development, with a focus on developing metrics and tools for building sustainability. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies widely, with annual sustainability and energy scorecards released by OMB during the Obama Administration. Scorecards report on agency progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity reduction, renewable energy use, water intensity reduction, fleet petroleum use reduction, and green buildings, using color-coded scores to indicate progress levels. Federal progress towards green building and energy intensity goals varies, with some agencies exceeding targets while others lag behind. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to ensure 15% of buildings comply with green building principles by FY2025, but some agencies have achieved compliance in less than 2% of buildings. The Energy Intensity Goal set by EISA to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015 was not met by many agencies, with government-wide energy intensity only declining by 22%. Agencies are now directed to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year starting from 2015. The Energy Intensity Goal set by EISA to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015 was not met by many agencies, with government-wide energy intensity only declining by 22%. E.O. 13693 replaced the earlier potable water intensity goal with a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Some agencies have already achieved the earlier goal, but concerns have been raised about the certification process for green building. Critics argue that many systems do not set caps on performance metrics, making claims to sustainability relative. Some argue that design criteria for green building are not sufficiently integrative, lacking integration across elements or stages in the building's life cycle. Others believe that mere mitigation of environmental impacts is not sustainable, advocating for new approaches like maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services. Concerns exist that builders new to green building may not prioritize a forward-thinking, integrative approach. The scientific and technological knowledge base for green building is limited, hindering the identification of appropriate approaches. The limitations in the knowledge base of green building make it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents further complicate the issue. Objective criteria for elements like siting are difficult to establish, posing challenges for quantitative evaluation. Congress may need to address the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination methods, extension of efforts nationwide, and prioritization of elements like siting. Congress may need to prioritize different elements of green building, including siting, and facilitate the growth of scientific knowledge in this area. GAO reports have highlighted the lack of integrative approaches in federal green building initiatives, recommending better coordination among agencies. Congress should assess the performance and efficiency of current green building programs to ensure effectiveness nationwide. Congress may wish to examine how well federal agencies are implementing green building programs and the impacts on adoption of green building practices. It may be useful to assess coordination among agencies and consider providing stronger incentives for energy-efficient mortgages. Additionally, Congress could fund rebate programs and provide specific appropriations to accelerate green building adoption in areas with low market penetration, such as residential renovation. Congress could consider regulatory actions to speed adoption of green building in areas with low market penetration, such as residential renovation. Congress may also examine how federal agencies are implementing green building programs and consider enhancing coordination and incentives for energy-efficient mortgages. Additionally, funding rebate programs and specific appropriations could accelerate green building adoption. Congress may wish to examine the effectiveness and balance of federal efforts in green building, considering whether existing programs need strengthening or new ones established. It is important to explore if the incremental approach in green building activities is sufficient to address national needs or if modifications are necessary. Funding for R&D in green building is currently suboptimal, with studies showing low levels of funding from federal and private-sector sources. Funding for R&D in green building is lower than industry average, with varying priorities on different elements. Congress should consider modifying federal funding levels, creating incentives for private-sector R&D, and ensuring sufficient training for a knowledgeable workforce in green building."
