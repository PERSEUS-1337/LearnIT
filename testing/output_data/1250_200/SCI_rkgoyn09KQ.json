    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM-based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modeling. The approach aims to incorporate language structure by considering word order and semantics in a unified framework named ctx-DocNADE. Incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modeling approach to improve word-topic mapping on smaller or short-text corpora. The proposed extension is named ctx-DocNADEe. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models consistently outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE are commonly used for topic extraction from text collections. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order and semantic information. To address this limitation, there is a need to extend probabilistic topic models to incorporate word order and language structure. Topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE do not consider language structure and word order, relying solely on \"bag-of-words\" (BoWs). In contrast, a deep contextualized LSTM-based language model (LSTM-LM) can capture syntax and semantics in different layers. LSTM-LMs assign probabilities to words based on the entire sentence, unlike traditional models. Recent studies have integrated latent topics with neural language models to improve semantics at a document level. While some models can capture word order in short contexts, they struggle with long-term dependencies and language concepts. Recurrent neural networks have shown a significant reduction in perplexity compared to standard n-gram models in language modeling. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, incorporates language structure and word order through LSTM-LM, allowing for accurate word prediction based on global and local contexts. It combines joint word and latent topic learning in a unified framework, as shown in FIG0, capturing complementary topic and word semantics. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of learning from contextual information in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences, significant word non-overlap, and a small training corpus. It highlights the effectiveness of distributional word representations like word embeddings in capturing semantic and syntactic relatedness in words. The example of conducting topic analysis over short text fragments demonstrates how traditional topic models struggle to infer relatedness between word pairs, while distributed embeddings can show semantic relatedness. The curr_chunk discusses incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance topic learning on smaller corpora or short texts. This approach leverages semantic similarities in a distributed space to create more coherent topic representations, combining the benefits of complementary learning. By combining complementary learning and external knowledge, the ctx-DocNADEe framework integrates topic and language models with pre-trained word embeddings to improve textual representations. This approach demonstrates better generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in various tasks such as topic extraction, information retrieval, and text classification. Results show a significant improvement in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and F1 score compared to state-of-the-art generative topic models across different datasets. Our proposed modeling approaches, named textTOvec, generate contextualized topic vectors from short-text and long-text documents. Various generative models, such as RBM, RSM, NADE, and DocNADE, are used to estimate complex probability distributions of high-dimensional observations. DocNADE models collections of documents as bags of words, improving textual representations for tasks like topic extraction and text classification. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as bags of words, learning word representations reflecting document topics. It uses a feed-forward neural network to compute word observations, ignoring syntactical and semantic features. The log-likelihood of any document is calculated based on word observations. The DocNADE model represents documents as bags of words, using a neural network to compute word observations. Two extensions are proposed: ctx-DocNADE introduces language structure via LSTM-LM, while ctx-DocNADEe incorporates external knowledge with pre-trained word embeddings. These models address the limitations of BoW representations by considering word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge. The ctx-DocNADE model enhances DocNADE by incorporating LSTM-based components for context-dependent word probabilities. It utilizes a shared weight matrix to capture global and local influences, improving semantic representations in documents. The LSTM component's embedding layer complements DocNADE by considering word order and language concepts. The ctx-DocNADEe model extends the ctx-DocNADE model by incorporating distributional priors and a pre-trained embedding matrix. It utilizes LSTM components to extract hidden vectors for each target word in a document, improving semantic representations. The computational complexity is reduced to O(HD) in DocNADE, and O(HD + N) in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe. The models can be used to extract text representations and can be extended to deep, multiple hidden layers. The LSTM network BID10 BID27 can be extended to a deep, multiple hidden layer architecture for improved performance. The conditional probability is computed using the last layer, and the modeling approaches are applied to various datasets for topic modeling. The study evaluates topic models like DocNADE on short and long-text datasets, comparing them with baselines like glove and doc2vec. Various quantitative measures are used, including generalization, topic coherence, text retrieval, and categorization. Baselines include LDA-based models and neural BoW models. The experimental setup involves training DocNADE on reduced and full vocabulary settings, using glove embeddings of 200 dimensions. Baselines and proposed models are evaluated over 200 topics to assess the quality of learned representations. Pre-training with \u03bb set to 0 is done to initialize complementary learning in ctx-DocNADEs. See appendices for experimental setup details and hyperparameters.

Topic coherence is assessed using a coherence measure proposed by BID25, showing higher scores in ctx-DocNADE compared to DocNADE. The introduction of embeddings in ctx-DocNADE boosts topic coherence, outperforming baseline methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA. The proposed models outperform baselines methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA, showing a gain of 4.6% on average over 11 datasets. Comparisons are made with other approaches combining topic and language models, such as TDLM and Topic-RNN. The focus of the work is on improving topic models by incorporating language concepts and external knowledge via neural language models. Experimental setup follows recent work TCNLM, quantitatively comparing performance in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. The performance of our models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset is analyzed. Different hyper-parameters like sliding window size and mixture weight of the LM component are considered. Results show that including word embeddings improves topic coherence, but ctx-DocNADEe does not show significant improvements over ctx-DocNADE.

The models are evaluated based on a document retrieval task using short-text and long-text documents with label information. Precision scores are computed for different fractions of retrieved training documents.

Topic modeling without pre-processing and filtering certain words also enhances IR precision. ctx-DocNADEe shows a 7.1% gain in IR precision on average over multiple datasets. ctx-DeepDNEe demonstrates competitive performance on specific datasets. The ctx-DocNADEe model outperforms DocNADE(RV) in precision by 6.5% on average over 14 datasets. It also surpasses TDLM and ProdLDA in text categorization. Using glove embeddings, ctx-DocNADEe shows a 4.8% and 3.6% gain in F1 score compared to DocNADE(RV) on short and long texts, respectively.

In terms of classification accuracy on the 20NS dataset, ctx-DocNADEe outperforms NTM and SCHOLAR. The model extracts more coherent topics due to embedding priors. The contribution of word embeddings and textTOvec representations in topic models is analyzed using DocNADE and ctxDoocNADEe models. The top 3 texts retrieved for an input query from the TMNtitle dataset are shown, with ctx-DocNADEe retrieving texts with no unigram overlap with the query. The retrieval results for the query \"emerging economies move ahead nuclear plans\" are illustrated, showing matches and mismatches in retrieved texts. The text discusses the improvement of topic models using word embeddings, specifically with the ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models. It highlights the quality of representations learned at different fractions of the training set and the significant gains in tasks with smaller dataset fractions. The findings demonstrate the enhancement of topic models with word embeddings, especially in sparse data scenarios.
