Unpaid child support payments are included in income. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act\" mandates that unpaid child support payments are considered taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act\" requires eligible taxpayers to send a notice to individuals who failed to make child support payments, informing them of the amount to include in their gross income for the preceding taxable year. If the taxpayer does not have the individual's address, the Secretary will send the notice if the address is available. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act\" requires eligible taxpayers to send a notice to individuals who failed to make child support payments, informing them of the amount to include in their gross income for the preceding taxable year. If the taxpayer does not have the individual's address, the Secretary will send the notice if the address is available. If the address is unknown, no income shall be included in gross income for any taxable year before the calendar year preceding the year in which the notice may be sent. Any subsequent payments required to be included in gross income can be deducted in the year they are made. The definitions of 'applicable child support payments' and 'eligible taxpayer' are as defined in section 166(f). The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. SEC. 4. ALLOWANCE OF BAD DEBT DEDUCTION FOR UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. SEC. 4. ALLOWANCE OF BAD DEBT DEDUCTION FOR UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow a deduction for unpaid child support payments for eligible taxpayers. The deduction is limited to $10,000 per child for applicable child support payments remaining unpaid at the end of the taxable year. Eligible taxpayers are individuals with adjusted gross income for the taxable year. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to an individual whose adjusted gross income is under $50,000 for the taxable year, with at least $500 of unpaid child support payments, and who meets identification requirements. An 'applicable child support payment' includes periodic fixed payments or expenses required to be paid by an individual under a support instrument meeting specific requirements. For an individual with an adjusted gross income under $50,000, at least $500 of unpaid child support payments, and meeting identification requirements, any payment required to support a qualifying child must be delinquent for at least a year to be considered unpaid child support. The taxpayer must ensure that child support payments for qualifying children are delinquent for at least a year to be considered unpaid child support. Identification requirements include providing the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the child and the individual responsible for making the payments. The taxpayer must certify if information on the individual responsible for child support payments is unknown. Cost-of-living adjustments increase specified dollar amounts annually. Subsequent payments qualifying for deduction must be included in gross income. The taxpayer must include subsequent child support payments in gross income if a deduction was previously allowed. Support instruments like divorce decrees or written agreements qualify for deductions. The tax code is amended to allow deductions for unpaid child support payments, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. This applies to debts that qualify as applicable child support payments under subsection (f). SEC. 5. REDUCTION OF FEDERAL DEBT.
