    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" and establishes a Rail Line Relocation Grant Program. The \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" establishes a grant program for rail line relocation projects to mitigate adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, traffic flow, and economic development in municipalities. Eligible projects involve relocating rail lines to avoid grade crossing closures or road construction. Grants are awarded based on a costs-benefits requirement. The grant program for rail line relocation projects under the \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" requires projects to meet a costs-benefits requirement. This includes considering factors such as the impact on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, area commerce, and rail operations. The Secretary also evaluates additional factors for approving grant applications. The Secretary considers various factors when awarding grants for rail line relocation projects, including the state's funding capability, allocation requirements, and equitable treatment of regions. Grant funds must be allocated based on project costs and limitations, with a maximum percentage for any single project. The federal share of the grant is also specified. In a rail line relocation project, the federal share of a grant awarded is 90% of the project's shared costs, with the state required to pay the remaining 10% in cash or in-kind contributions such as real property, personal property, or employee services. The federal grant for a rail line relocation project covers 90% of shared costs, with the state responsible for the remaining 10% in cash or in-kind contributions. The state's costs include pay and benefits of employees, excluding overhead and administrative costs. Any costs incurred before the grant application and in-kind contributions made to comply with statutory requirements are also eligible for reimbursement. The federal grant covers 90% of shared costs for a rail line relocation project, with the state responsible for the remaining 10% in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary determines the amount of costs not shared and total shared costs. Two or more States can combine amounts through an agreement. States can combine grant amounts for projects if it benefits all states involved and does not violate any laws. The Secretary will create regulations for this section, and funds are authorized for fiscal years 2001-2005. For fiscal years 2003-2006, $500,000,000 is allocated annually. The table of sections in title 23, United States Code, is updated accordingly. The Secretary of Transportation will issue temporary regulations by December 31, 2001, for the grant program under section 207 of title 23, United States Code. Final regulations must be issued by October 1, 2002, to implement the program."
