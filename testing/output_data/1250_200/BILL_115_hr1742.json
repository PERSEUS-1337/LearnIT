    "content": "The \"Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017\" requires the compilation and transmission of applications and rescissions of applications to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution to Congress. The Archivist of the United States is required to compile and transmit all applications and rescissions of applications made by States under Article V of the Constitution to Congress and the Committees on the Judiciary. The Archivist will use records from the National Archive and Records Administration and other resources to obtain official copies of any missing applications or rescissions. The compilation must be transmitted according to a specified schedule. After enactment, applications and rescissions must be submitted as follows:\n- 1 Year: 1970 and later\n- 2 Years: 1920 through 1969\n- 3 Years: 1870 through 1919\n- 4 Years: 1820 through 1869\n- 5 Years: before 1820 Applications and rescissions before 1820. The Archivist must report to Congress on missing applications or rescissions, catalog them by year and State, and clarify that the transmittal is not an official designation of valid state applications under article V of the Constitution. Upon receipt of the compilation described in section 2(a), the committees on the judiciary in each House of Congress must designate applications and rescissions for public availability on a website within 6 months. They are also required to update the public websites with any new applications or rescissions submitted under article V of the Constitution. Recommended procedures for the transmission of applications and rescissions are outlined in section 4. The Congress recommends procedures for State legislatures to submit applications or rescissions under article V of the Constitution. The secretary of state or designated officer should send copies of the resolution to Congress, with the exact text and date of adoption included. State legislatures must include the signature of the relevant officer and the adoption date in their applications or rescissions under article V. If the submission lacks an authenticating signature, the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate will verify its authenticity through public records or a letter from the State official. Noncompliance with these recommendations does not give Congress the right to reject an application. The failure of a State legislature to comply with procedures recommended in this section is not a basis for Congress to refuse to accept an application or rescission. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not expand Congress's duties under article V of the Constitution. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. Defines terms like \"transmit to Congress\" and \"application.\" SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 7. Authorization of appropriations for the National Historical Publications and Records Commission: $2,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2023. Historical Record Grant Program funding increased to $3,000,000 annually for the same period."
