    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. IDEA has been amended multiple times, with the most recent being the 1997 reauthorization. Currently, Congress is examining IDEA again with H.R. 1350, which passed the House in 2003. This report will discuss the major changes proposed by H.R. 1350. The Committee ordered the bill favorably reported by a vote of 29 to 19. The report discusses the major changes that H.R. 1350 would make to current law if enacted. Several issues were not included in the final version of H.R. 1350, such as mandatory full funding and parental choice provisions. The definitions in current law remain largely unchanged, with a few amendments, including the definition of FAPE. The amendment to H.R. 1350 aims to ensure that educational services for children with disabilities are provided at public expense, meet state standards, and align with individualized education programs. It also includes a new provision to enable access to the general curriculum. Additionally, the bill adds a definition of \"highly qualified\" to align with requirements for teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act. H.R. 1350 discusses definitions of children with disabilities under IDEA and includes provisions for highly qualified teachers. It also mandates GAO studies on IDEA issues and makes minimal changes to grant formulas. The bill H.R. 1350 would simplify the language of Part B grants-to-states formula under IDEA, limiting the number of children with disabilities counted for maximum state grants. It aims to discourage states from over-identifying children with disabilities to increase funding. The bill also specifies authorized amounts for Part B appropriations, except for the preschool program. The bill H.R. 1350 simplifies the language of Part B grants-to-states formula under IDEA and specifies authorized amounts for appropriations, with annual increases until FY2010. It also makes changes to state reserves for administration and other activities. The bill H.R. 1350 simplifies the language of Part B grants-to-states formula under IDEA, specifies authorized amounts for appropriations with annual increases until FY2010, and makes changes to state reserves for administration and other activities. States can retain a percentage of their grants for state purposes, with variations among states, and the bill would set a maximum amount for state-level activities based on FY2003 grants. H.R. 1350 sets the maximum amount states can retain for state-level activities at the FY2003 level. It also increases the state minimum for administration to $750,000 without inflation adjustment. States can use up to 40% of funds for high-cost special education services. This addresses the issue of educating children with low incidence, high-cost disabilities, highlighted by the Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. The Supreme Court ruled that schools must provide extensive services to students with disabilities, as long as they are not medical services requiring a physician. H.R. 1350 outlines permitted uses of funds for state-level activities, including implementing voluntary binding arbitration and developing educational support systems. States must distribute remaining funds to local educational agencies to meet IDEA requirements. H.R. 1350 would change the language of section 612(a) by replacing \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of\" with \"reasonably demonstrates to.\" This change is seen as a less stringent requirement, allowing states to show they have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with IDEA. The House report states that this modification was made to address concerns about the Department of Education focusing too much on process compliance. H.R. 1350 aims to align state eligibility requirements with the No Child Left Behind Act, specifically focusing on personnel standards for special education teachers. The change in language from \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of\" to \"reasonably demonstrates to\" is intended to ensure overall compliance with IDEA without forcing states to make unnecessary changes to their laws. H.R. 1350 would align state eligibility requirements with the No Child Left Behind Act, including personnel standards for special education teachers. It would also require state performance goals for children with disabilities to align with the State's definition of adequate yearly progress. IDEA provisions address children with disabilities in private schools, including funding for those unilaterally placed by parents. The IDEA provisions address special education services for children with disabilities in private schools, including funding for those placed by parents. Reimbursement for enrollment costs may be required if FAPE was not provided in a timely manner. Exceptions to reimbursement limitations include situations where parents are unable to provide notice due to illiteracy or when compliance would harm the child. H.R. 1350 clarifies provisions for special education services in private schools for children with disabilities. It includes changes to child find requirements, consultation, right to appeal, and reimbursement for private school placement. The bill also emphasizes the need for direct services to be provided using IDEA funds for children placed in private schools by their parents. H.R. 1350 would ensure that parents of children with disabilities are reimbursed for private school placement and make additions to child find provisions. It requires timely child find processes for private school students, consultation with private school representatives, and the right to appeal to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with decisions. Reimbursement cannot be denied if the school prevented notice, parents did not receive required notice, or compliance was not met. H.R. 1350 ensures reimbursement for private school placement for parents of children with disabilities. It also includes provisions for timely child find processes, consultation with private school representatives, and the right to appeal decisions to the Secretary of Education. Reimbursement cannot be denied if notice was prevented by the school, parents did not receive required notice, or compliance was not met. Additionally, H.R. 1350 makes changes to local educational agency eligibility and allows funds to be used for high-cost special education services. H.R. 1350 continues local financial requirements for special education funding, including the supplement not supplant rule and maintenance of effort requirement. It allows LEAs to use up to 20% of increased IDEA grants for ESEA programs and modifies state oversight. The bill also expands permitted uses of funds for local educational agencies. H.R. 1350 expands permitted uses of funds for local educational agencies, aligning IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act.

H.R. 1350 expands the use of funds for local educational agencies under IDEA, allowing for additional academic and behavioral support for children with disabilities. It also addresses evaluations, assessments, and parental consent for determining specific learning disabilities. The bill provides flexibility for LEAs when parents do not consent to evaluations. H.R. 1350 allows LEAs to proceed with an initial evaluation if parents do not provide consent. The bill also makes changes to IEP requirements, including removing benchmarks and limiting regular education teacher participation in IEP meetings. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to IEP team meetings, allowing for joint excusal of members, written document modifications to IEPs, multi-year IEP options, and alternative meeting participation methods.

H.R. 1350 aims to make significant changes to procedural safeguards for parents of children with disabilities, including adding a statute of limitations for complaints and altering the requirements for prior written notice. The bill also eliminates the need to provide procedural safeguards on every notification of an IEP meeting and reevaluation. Instead, safeguards will be given at the initial referral or parental request for evaluation. H.R. 1350 introduces changes to procedural safeguards for parents of children with disabilities, including providing the safeguards notice upon referral, annually, and upon request. It also includes provisions for voluntary binding arbitration and resolution sessions, expanding mediation procedures to cover disputes before a complaint is filed, and introducing voluntary binding arbitration for dispute resolution when a hearing is requested. The state educational agency must provide procedures for voluntary binding arbitration to resolve disputes when a hearing is requested under IDEA. The arbitration must be agreed to in writing by both parties, conducted by an impartial arbitrator, and is final unless there is fraud or misconduct. The arbitration is scheduled promptly and held at a convenient location for the parties involved. Parents have the right to request a due process hearing under IDEA for issues related to their child's education. They can be accompanied by counsel and individuals with expertise in disabilities, present evidence, confront witnesses, and receive a written record of the hearing. The decision made in the hearing is final but can be appealed in court. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party. H.R. 1350 proposes significant changes to IDEA due process procedures. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to IDEA due process procedures, including allowing either parents or the LEA to request a due process hearing conducted by the SEA. It introduces a \"resolution session\" where the LEA meets with parents and professionals to resolve complaints before a hearing. If not resolved within 30 days, a due process hearing will occur. The resolution session is separate from administrative or judicial actions. H.R. 1350 introduces changes to IDEA due process procedures, including a \"resolution session\" for resolving complaints before a due process hearing. Procedural safeguards such as the right to counsel, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses are not available during the resolution session. Parents cannot raise new issues at the due process hearing unless discussed in the complaint or resolution session. An amendment would change how attorneys' fees are determined, shifting the responsibility to the Governor or state official instead of the court. Attorneys' fees under current law are determined by the court and based on prevailing community rates. Fees may be awarded to parents of a child with a disability who prevail in the case, with specific prohibitions and restrictions in place. Fees cannot be awarded for services performed after a settlement offer or for IEP team meetings unless certain conditions are met. Awards may be made if the parent was justified in rejecting a settlement offer, with the possibility of fees being reduced in certain circumstances. Attorneys' fees for parents of children with disabilities are currently determined by the court based on community rates. Fees can be awarded if the parent was justified in rejecting a settlement offer, with the possibility of reduction in certain circumstances.

A manifestation determination review is conducted to assess the link between the child's disability and behavior. Expulsion may occur if behavior is not disability-related, but educational services must continue. H.R. 1350 proposes changes in disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, allowing for suspension for up to ten school days and placement in interim alternative educational settings for up to forty-five days. The change in placement could last beyond 45 school days if required by state law for safety reasons. The bill also removes the requirement for a manifestation determination review and allows for disciplinary procedures applicable to children without disabilities in certain cases. Additionally, it includes provisions for high-quality professional development in personnel preparation programs.

Nethercutt in H.R. 1350 modifies the exception for infants and toddlers with disabilities to be served in \"natural environments.\" It allows for early intervention in a setting determined most appropriate by the parent and the individualized family service plan team. Part D of the bill has been revised, including rearranging language and focusing state competitive grants on professional development activities. H.R. 1350 would focus grants on professional development activities, requiring at least 90% of funds to be used for this purpose. It continues provisions for Community Parent Resource Centers and establishes a National Center for Special Education Research. The bill also mandates the General Accounting Office to conduct reports on IDEA and special education requirements. The General Accounting Office (GAO) will conduct reports on IDEA and special education, including reviews of federal and state requirements, differences in identifying children with disabilities, distance learning for professional development, services for limited English proficient students, and state costs for IDEA compliance."
