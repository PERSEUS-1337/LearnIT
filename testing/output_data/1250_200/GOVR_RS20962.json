    "content": "The Western Sahara was a Spanish possession until the mid-1970s when Spain planned to decolonize the region. Morocco and Mauritania opposed this plan and claimed the territory due to its valuable resources. The International Court of Justice found no tie of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and Western Sahara. In response, Morocco launched a \"Green March\" to claim the region, leading to Spain agreeing to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian administration. The independence-seeking Polisario Front resisted this takeover. In the 1970s, Sahrawis fled to refugee camps in Algeria and Mauritania due to Moroccan-Mauritanian takeover. With Algeria's support, Polisario established SADR in Tindouf, Algeria. Morocco built a sand wall to separate occupied Western Sahara from Polisario. UN proposed a settlement plan in 1988, leading to a ceasefire in 1991 and the establishment of MINURSO for a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco. In the 1990s, the UN appointed James A. Baker III as an envoy to resolve the voter identification deadlock between Morocco and the Polisario in Western Sahara. Despite identifying 86,000 voters, over 130,000 appeals were made, leading to UN Security Council Resolution 1301 in 2000 suggesting alternatives to a referendum. Cooperation from all parties, including Morocco, the Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania, was deemed necessary for effective implementation of the settlement plan. The UN proposed a framework agreement for the Western Sahara, allowing the population to elect executive and legislative bodies. Morocco would control certain areas, while a referendum on final status would be held within five years. Morocco accepted the framework, but Algeria and the Polisario criticized it for not specifying the final status options. Annan proposed four options for resolving the Western Sahara conflict, including a possible division of the territory or the withdrawal of the U.N.'s involvement. The Security Council asked Baker for a new plan that would allow for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. Baker presented the Baker Peace Plan in January 2003, which called for a U.N.-organized referendum for voters to choose between integration with Morocco, autonomy, or independence. Morocco objected to the U.N.'s revival of the referendum option for resolving the Western Sahara conflict, preferring autonomy over independence. Algeria supported the Baker Plan, advocating for self-determination in a referendum. In June 2004, James Baker resigned as the U.N. Secretary-General's personal envoy after Security Council Resolution 1541 seemed to express stronger support for a mutually acceptable political solution than for his peace plan. U.N. referendum-related activities subsequently ceased, and the Baker Plan has not been mentioned in Security Council resolutions since then. In July 2005, Annan appointed Danish diplomat Peter van Walsum as his new envoy. Van Walsum indicated that he could not draft a new plan because Morocco would only endorse one that excludes independence, while the U.N. could not endorse a plan excluding a referendum with independence as an option. He concluded that the remaining options were deadlock or direct negotiations. Van Walsum also reported that the Western Sahara was not high on the international political agenda. In 2007 and 2008, Morocco and the Polisario met four times at Manhasset, NY, but were unwilling to discuss each other's proposals for autonomy and a referendum. Van Walsum stated that an independent Western Sahara was not realistic, leading to accusations of bias from the Polisario. Ban Ki-moon did not reappoint van Walsum in August 2008. Morocco and Algeria have competed for regional influence since their independence. Since independence, Morocco and Algeria have vied for regional dominance, with the Western Sahara conflict serving as a focal point. The two neighbors have different decolonization histories and political systems, with Morocco strongly asserting its claim to Western Sahara under King Mohammed VI. The territory, while a financial burden, holds potential economic benefits. Moroccan authorities view Western Sahara as a counterbalance to Algeria's regional ambitions. Moroccan authorities view the Western Sahara as a check on Algeria's regional ambitions. King Mohammed VI suggested decentralization as a solution for the Sahara and emphasized the importance of respecting Morocco's territorial integrity. Morocco presented an autonomy plan for the region under its sovereignty in 2007. Algeria sees the Western Sahara as a decolonization campaign. Algeria supports Polisario's independence claims in Western Sahara, benefiting from access to the Atlantic Ocean. Algeria's ties in Sub-Saharan Africa may have influenced SADR's AU membership. Morocco's suspension from the AU in 1984 over SADR recognition leaves it as the only non-member state. U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross has been the UN Personal Envoy for Western Sahara since 2009, proposing informal talks between the parties. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has supported U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross as the UN Personal Envoy for Western Sahara since 2009. Despite lack of progress in informal talks between the parties, Ross continues his efforts to move negotiations forward. Morocco withdrew confidence in Ross in 2012, but Ban Ki-moon reaffirmed support for him. Ross has shifted to a new approach focusing on shuttle diplomacy between Morocco and the Polisario to break the current stalemate. Moroccan officials criticize MINURSO as biased, but Ross remains in his position. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon supports U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross as the UN Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. Ross is focusing on shuttle diplomacy between Morocco and the Polisario to break the current stalemate. MINURSO continues to operate in a challenging political and security environment, reporting violations of the cease-fire accord. The U.N. Secretary-General's report notes a gradual shift in the military balance favoring Morocco and a shortage of military personnel compromising MINURSO's effectiveness. Personnel east of the berm are exposed to terrorist threats from neighboring regions. MINURSO's budget has slightly decreased in recent years, with the United States contributing. The U.N. Security Council raised MINURSO's troop ceiling by 15 military observers in April 2014. Human rights advocates and Polisario activists have expressed concerns about restrictions on freedom of expression in Moroccan-administered Western Sahara. Criticism of the king and support for Western Sahara independence are not tolerated in these areas. The State Department's human rights report highlights government restrictions on civil liberties and political rights in Western Sahara. Moroccan security forces use disproportionate force to suppress Sahrawi protests and detain pro-independence advocates. Reports of torture and abuse of detainees have been documented by Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture. Despite some positive developments in human rights, including judicial reforms and increased international visits, restrictions on civil society groups and freedom of expression persist in Western Sahara under King Mohammed VI's rule. King Mohammed VI has made efforts to address human rights abuses in Western Sahara, including compensating victims through a 2004 commission. Concerns remain about freedom of expression and movement in the refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for independent monitoring of human rights in both Moroccan-administered areas and the camps. The Polisario and human rights advocates seek to add human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, opposed by Morocco and its ally France. Morocco, supported by France, opposes adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate. Concerns over terrorism and insecurity in the region have increased due to arms flows and violent extremist groups. In 2011, aid workers were kidnapped from the Tindouf camps. In October 2011, European aid workers were kidnapped from the Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria by a splinter faction of AQIM. There are concerns about AQIM's recruitment and smuggling operations in the Sahrawi refugee camps. Moroccan officials fear an independent Western Sahara would be vulnerable to terrorist infiltration, while the Polisario denies links to AQIM and accuses Moroccan security services of supporting terrorist networks. The United States has not recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara or the SADR. The U.S. supported the U.N. settlement plan and the Baker Plan. President George W. Bush acknowledged Moroccan sensitivity over the Sahara issue in 2003. The U.S. described Morocco's 2007 autonomy plan as credible and urged negotiations for an acceptable autonomy regime in 2008. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed U.S. policy on Western Sahara in 2009. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for the U.N.-led mediation effort in Western Sahara. She praised Morocco's autonomy plan as a potential approach to resolving the conflict and encouraged all parties, including Algeria, to play an active role in finding a peaceful solution. Clinton's stance was reaffirmed in 2011 and 2012 during public appearances with Moroccan and Algerian officials. Former Secretary Clinton's 2011 phrasing on the autonomy plan was reiterated in joint U.S.-Morocco statements in 2012 and 2013, highlighting the importance of U.S.-Moroccan relations. U.S. officials view Morocco as a key ally and prefer a resolution to the Western Sahara issue that maintains stability and security cooperation. They also emphasize the U.N.-led process and believe a settlement could enhance regional stability and prosperity. The U.S. officials agree with the U.N. view that MINURSO has maintained the cease-fire effectively. The U.N. Security Council reauthorized MINURSO in April 2014, increasing troop levels. The U.S. provides funding for MINURSO but does not contribute uniformed personnel. The Obama Administration requested $17.5 million for MINURSO in FY2014. The Obama Administration requested $17.5 million for MINURSO in FY2015. In April 2013, U.S. diplomats supported adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, but Morocco opposed it. No such proposal was made during MINURSO's mandate renewal in April 2014. Congressional positions on Morocco's autonomy initiative and human rights in Western Sahara are regularly expressed through foreign aid legislation. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows bilateral economic assistance for Morocco to be used in Western Sahara, but funds cannot be programmed there due to concerns about Moroccan sovereignty. Reporting requirements include updating a report on human rights conditions in Western Sahara. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows bilateral economic assistance for Morocco to be used in Western Sahara, but funds cannot be programmed there due to concerns about Moroccan sovereignty. Reporting requirements include updating a report on human rights conditions in Western Sahara, focusing on steps taken by the Government of Morocco to release political prisoners and support human rights monitoring by the U.N. Mission. Efforts at shuttle diplomacy by U.N. envoy Ross have not resolved the stalemate, prompting the U.N. Secretary-General to suggest a comprehensive review of the negotiating framework if no progress is made by April 2015. The rise of instability in the Sahel region underscores the urgency of settling the long-standing issue. In 2013, the U.N. Secretary-General reported to the Security Council on the instability in the Sahel region and urged addressing the Western Sahara conflict as part of a broader strategy. The Polisario insists on self-determination through a referendum, while Morocco proposes autonomy under its sovereignty. Some Sahrawis feel caught between the two sides, with uncertain international leverage. The U.N. Secretary-General noted in April 2014 that the cease-fire holds, but the Polisario occasionally threatens armed struggle. Regional instability has made settlement efforts challenging. The Polisario periodically threatens armed conflict but lacks the capability without Algeria's support. Morocco's large army presence in Western Sahara deters the Polisario. The group encourages protests but avoids terrorism to maintain international sympathy. Reports of a splinter movement challenging the Polisario's leadership are uncertain. Morocco insists on its autonomy proposal as the only solution, citing investments and governance reforms in the region. Morocco asserts its autonomy proposal as the best solution for Western Sahara, backed by investments, governance reforms, and local representation. The country's Economic, Social, and Environmental Council has proposed a new development model focusing on sustainability and participatory democracy. International interest in the region has grown, with U.S. and French companies exploring offshore oil, and the EU having a fishing agreement with Morocco. The Polisario opposes these activities. The Polisario opposes natural resource extraction agreements in Western Sahara and has its own offshore agreements with oil companies. The status of the territory under international law complicates investor operations. If oil is found, it could escalate the conflict. Aid is provided to Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf by UNHCR, WFP, and humanitarian organizations. The camps are administered by the Polisario, and Algeria has not allowed a census of refugees. Some believe the number of refugees is lower than reported, and aid may be diverted for leverage. Socioeconomic hardships have led to dissatisfaction among the refugees. Relations between Morocco and Algeria remain strained due to the unresolved Western Sahara issue, with the border closed since 1994. The Arab Maghreb Union, of which both countries are members, is largely inactive as a result. Socioeconomic hardships have led to dissatisfaction among Sahrawi refugees, particularly the youth, in the camps."
