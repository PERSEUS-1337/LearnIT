    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from disruptions to CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance on critical infrastructure protection, emphasizing national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks and the interdependence of economic and military power on CI. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government. It aimed to eliminate national vulnerability to cyber or physical attacks. However, assessing the criticality of specific assets has proven challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of infrastructure systems. For example, the U.S. electricity sub-sector alone has nearly 7,000 operational power plants. Critical infrastructure, as defined by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, includes systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, public health, and safety. The focus has expanded to include essential services and public conveniences, with an increased concern for threats posed by state and asymmetric actors. The intelligence community has expanded its focus on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure (CI) posed by state and non-state adversaries. Asymmetric attacks, using physical or cyber means, aim to damage or disrupt domestic CI systems and assets. Policy now includes infrastructure-related events with disruptive effects, emphasizing infrastructure as vital for prosperity, public safety, and civic well-being. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure as assets that support American society and considers impacts of natural and manmade hazards at various levels. CI policy has evolved to focus on society-centric resilience over asset protection, with U.S. election systems designated as critical infrastructure in 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. This designation is part of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the 2013 NIPP. The federal government utilizes these sectors for voluntary public-private partnerships to enhance security and resilience. The critical infrastructure sectors, designated by DHS, involve public-private partnerships with various federal agencies playing leading roles. Each sector has formal coordination bodies representing private sector stakeholders and SLTT governments. As sectors evolve, new communities of interest emerge with unique perspectives on criticality in the nation's infrastructure. Communities of interest within the critical infrastructure enterprise have diverse perspectives on what criticality means for the nation's infrastructure. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, reflecting the evolving interests and perspectives of different constituencies. This variation in definitions is not just a matter of semantics but reflects negotiations on congressional responsibility, government programs, and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy has two orientations, critical infrastructure protection (CIP), emphasizing the protection of critical systems and assets. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of their loss or disruption. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure availability of essential services during emergencies. Policy in developed countries now leans towards system resilience over asset protection, following major legislation post-9/11 attacks. In the United States and other developed countries, policy practice has shifted towards system resilience over asset protection in critical infrastructure security. Legislation post-9/11 has emphasized the need for identifying critical systems and assets for higher levels of protection, leading to complexities in asset identification and prioritization across all sectors. The application of logic in asset identification and prioritization introduces complexities in practice across all critical infrastructure sectors. Inventory requirements are the first step in risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. Defining criticality criteria remains a debated topic, but list/no-list decisions help identify critical assets. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in 2003 directed the development of a comprehensive database to catalog critical facilities, systems, and functions. This led to the release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which served as the basis for critical infrastructure policy development until 2013. Despite claims of compiling a comprehensive database in the 2006 NIPP, a DHS Inspector General report in the same year found conceptual and methodological shortcomings in the national database of critical infrastructure assets. The Department's National Asset Database grew rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, including a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos. The database had entries for unusual assets without clear criticality, and data collection procedures were not standardized. Congress included provisions for the National Asset Database in the 9-11 Commission Act, requiring a national database of vital systems and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure to be updated annually. The Department's National Asset Database expanded rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, encompassing a wide range of assets. Congress mandated a classified list of \"prioritized critical infrastructure\" to be updated annually, including assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted. The 2013 GAO report highlighted improvements in critical asset identification processes by DHS but raised concerns about reporting criteria and methodology consistency. The NCIPP, established by DHS to comply with the 9-11 Commission Act, assessed criticality based on potential adverse consequences above specified thresholds. The NCIPP, established by DHS to comply with the 9-11 Commission Act, assesses criticality of asset nominations based on potential adverse consequences above specified thresholds. Methodological adjustments are made to account for unique CI characteristics, such as the impact of the collapse of the U.S. financial system on national security and economic security. The report recommends an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP elevates the asset to national significance under relevant statutes. The NCIPP assesses asset criticality based on potential adverse consequences, with adjustments for unique characteristics. Being listed as a prioritized asset elevates it to national significance. Despite the significant ramifications, some states opt out due to compliance burdens and technical limitations. The NCIPP list is not a complete national inventory, and DHS has not complied with annual reporting requirements. The DHS was unable to provide documentation for compliance with annual reporting requirements. The complexities of CI inventory suggest persistent difficulties in ensuring completeness and quality. The CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems. The approach expands data collection to include all assets within a sector for emergency planning. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a major CI database using the capabilities approach. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a database compiled by lead agencies like DHS and DOD, providing data on critical assets for homeland security functions. It includes various asset categories, essential for lifeline critical infrastructure functions, as well as non-critical assets that may become crucial during specific emergencies or policy decisions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database includes critical assets for homeland security functions and non-critical assets that may become crucial during emergencies or policy decisions. HIFLD was used during the 2017 hurricane season by the Department of Health and Human Services to locate day care centers in impacted areas, essential for ensuring the safety of children in disaster zones. The HIFLD partnership model enables relevant agencies and private sector entities to leverage infrastructure data for real-world use cases. Unlike the NCIPP list, HIFLD does not elevate specific systems and assets to support federal oversight, regulation, and administration. The HIFLD database is widely used for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies. Despite declining state participation in NCIPP, CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. Specific chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to DHS inspection and regulatory enforcement under CFATS. Congress may consider the implications of these regulations. Congress may need to consider the implications of policy shifts towards system-level resilience for legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations for data gathering and analysis. Updates to National Asset Database requirements should align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure systems and assets is crucial for understanding homeland security risks. Identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure systems and assets is crucial for understanding homeland security risks. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation decisions, congressional appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, federal grant funding, and voluntary security measures. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, events, or occurrences, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. Threat assessments cover human adversaries and natural hazards like extreme weather events. Threat assessments include data on human adversaries or natural hazards, estimating timing, methods, and frequency of attacks. Vulnerability assessments identify weaknesses in assets or systems that may be exploited. Recommendations for resilience measures may be included to mitigate risks. DHS defines consequence as the effect of an event, incident, or occurrence. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt infrastructure systems. Various methods are used for these assessments, including technical and non-technical approaches. Consequence-based criticality assessments can inform risk assessments when combined with threat and vulnerability assessments. DHS has integrated these risk elements into its planning, programs, and budget activities since 2007. DHS has applied risk elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence since 2007. Critics challenge the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks. Complex interactions between these elements make risk assessment for grant applications problematic. DHS recognized the need for a systemic risk picture for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed updates to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive initiatives in 2018-2019 aimed to establish the basis for significant changes in CI risk assessment. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (CISA Act; P.L. 115-278) created the agency (CISA) to take over functions from the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) as a DHS headquarters organization. CISA established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national critical infrastructure (CI) risk with an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information from CISA on efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. The Homeland Security Act specifies how organizational resources can be leveraged for infrastructure risk assessment methodology. Federal organization for critical infrastructure (CI) issues has evolved in response to threats, with three distinct periods of development: policy initiatives in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization, and transition to an all-hazards resilience framework. Congressional funding priorities and program guidance play a role in supporting national CI security goals. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. PDD-63, issued two years later, required the government to eliminate vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attacks within five years. The directive focused on increasing interagency coordination through the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, found that implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked program and budget authority, and there was no overall national CIP strategy in place. The Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) were still in early stages of development. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concern for critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged, one favoring the reestablishment of the Office of Homeland Security with enhanced coordination and oversight, following the Gilmore Commission's recommendations. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) under the FBI had not fully established its functions for CI threat assessments and response coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission for comprehensive consolidation of government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency, the National Homeland Security Agency. This aimed to ensure clearer lines of executive authority, centralization of relevant counterterrorism functions, and better interagency coordination to protect against terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS, incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. This change prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, representing a shift in infrastructure policy. The White House previously viewed infrastructure policy as tangentially related to counterterrorism before 9/11. The Office of Management and Budget distinguished CIP as a separate mission from counterterrorism, citing diverse risks beyond terrorism. Funding for CIP that overlapped with counterterrorism was minimal before 9/11. The White House requested a budget increase for FY2004, reflecting the heightened focus on counterterrorism efforts post-9/11. The budget request was $12.1 billion, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, and included 28 federal entities outside of the newly-created DHS. The 2003 OMB report highlighted the redefined focus of infrastructure programs towards counterterrorism missions. The creation of a new department aimed to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions under unified leadership. The consolidation of functions under the new Department of Homeland Security transferred over half of pre-9/11 homeland security funding to a single agency, but independent agencies within DHS retained significant autonomy. Despite changes, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) remained decentralized and competed for resources with other federal priorities. Counterterrorism remained a key focus for CIP policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened by 2005, with fewer Americans naming terrorism as the most important problem post-9/11. The perception of the terrorist threat had significantly softened by 2005, with fewer Americans considering terrorism as the most important problem. Public concern about terrorism decreased to 6%-8% in the years following the 9/11 attacks. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards beyond terrorism. The government's critical infrastructure policies were criticized for focusing too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks and not enough on other potential threats. The Council argued that government critical infrastructure policies were too focused on protecting assets from terrorist attacks, rather than improving resilience against various threats. The House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings in 2008 addressing resilience, with DHS officials stating that policies did encourage resilience. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while also emphasizing the need for resilience. The QHSR emphasized the range of challenges faced since 9/11, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, and transnational crime. It highlighted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 in 2013, focusing on resilience against various threats rather than just terrorist attacks. The 2013 NIPP, influenced by PPD-21, shifted focus from physical infrastructure protection to all-hazards resilience. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include aging systems and neglect. DHS failed to submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving strategic direction for infrastructure security unclear. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated among various stakeholders. Congress directed the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS in 2002, but in 2018, Congress authorized its transfer back to USDA. Critical infrastructure security in the federal government has evolved into a distributed enterprise with institutionalized partnerships and policy frameworks. In the early 2000s, critical infrastructure security in the federal government has evolved into a distributed enterprise with institutionalized partnerships and policy frameworks emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine the division of responsibilities between homeland security and other areas like commerce and public utilities regulation. The evolving definition of homeland security goes beyond counterterrorism roots, and a more current strategy from DHS is needed to clarify goals and activities related to critical infrastructure security. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) highlights Congressional interest in homeland security strategy. The proposed act aims to enhance DHS's capstone strategy by linking it with budgeting, program management, and prioritization. Congress has also acted to define organizational relationships within DHS, transitioning from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated approach. The Department of Homeland Security has four main directorates, each corresponding to a primary security mission. The structure has shifted from centralized to more federated, emphasizing operational roles. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may consider the organization and relationships within DHS to support critical infrastructure security. The management of critical infrastructure (CI) risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment poses policy challenges. Legislators generally support a federated partnership model for CI security, relying on voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors. The federated partnership model outlined in PDD-63 emphasizes voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors for critical infrastructure security. CI owner-operators are responsible for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level, while government agencies manage risk at the national level. This collaborative approach relies on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security to address infrastructure risks collectively. Individual enterprise-level investments in security and resilience are necessary to manage critical infrastructure risk at the societal level. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop risk management strategies and mitigation investments for national resilience goals. Government efforts to encourage voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships have varied in effectiveness, especially for low-probability/high-consequence events like terrorist attacks or earthquakes. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop risk management strategies and mitigation investments for national resilience goals. Industry participation is incentivized by improved access to risk information, the value of national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. Legislation such as the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 and public-private coordination councils facilitate information sharing and collaboration. The OECD report highlights that voluntary information sharing and collaboration may not provide enough incentive for investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are often used in critical infrastructure sectors with potential catastrophic impacts. Collaborative approaches are favored as risks become more privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in CI security. The regulatory reach of government in CI security includes various agencies such as DHS, TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA. These agencies have specific regulatory mandates related to infrastructure security, with examples like oversight of oil and gas pipeline security and regulation of chemical facilities under the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards program. Other agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also have regulatory authority over specific sectors like civilian nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities, enforcing safety requirements stemming from the Three Mile Island incident. Infrastructure security relevant to homeland security is overseen by the NRC, not DHS. DHS focuses on enhancing collaboration with partners through information sharing, training, and voluntary assessments. The current Critical Infrastructure (CI) partnership structures, organized under PPD-21, emphasize distributed responsibility among stakeholders for national resilience goals. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) led by a designated federal agency. These partnerships are administered by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal departments. The Critical Infrastructure (CI) partnership structures, organized under PPD-21, involve Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) and Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) led by designated federal agencies. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), with other SSAs including EPA, GSA, and various departments. SSAs use NIPP partnership structures to create sector-specific infrastructure protection plans tailored to unique sector characteristics and requirements. SCCs consist of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by the corresponding GCC as \"appropriately representative.\" Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are self-organized and self-governed groups recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as \"appropriately representative\" of the sector. They have advisory relationships with the federal government, facilitate information sharing between government and private-sector stakeholders, and may support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. ISACs maintain operations centers, deploy representatives to national cybersecurity centers, and provide informational products for members. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. Additionally, four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) enhances infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates issues among private-sector stakeholders. The Regional Consortium Coordinating Council promotes best practices among regional resilience coalitions. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads policy consensus on CI risk management strategies among federal agencies. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics, providing legal exemptions for open meetings and reporting. It engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop policy advice for DHS and relevant agencies. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. Members are appointed by the Secretary and include leaders from various sectors. CI-relevant subcommittees focus on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on CI policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. Established in 2001, it monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages information sharing mechanisms. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages information sharing mechanisms. It operates with a flat partnership structure involving various activities like symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders across different sectors to promote system resilience over asset protection. The partnership structure is supported by operational elements maintained by DHS, such as the National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) for threat analysis and information sharing. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It is part of the DHS National Operations Center and is administered by CISA. The partnership system aims to increase industry willingness to invest in system-level resilience through collaboration and information sharing initiatives. Private sector owner-operators' embrace of collaboration and information-sharing initiatives offered by federal agencies under the partnership system varies across sectors. Empirical analyses on the effectiveness of collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited. A 2013 study found that less than half of critical infrastructure sectors actively engaged in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures. Strong communities of interest were observed in sectors with specific threats posing individual risk to member companies. The private sector's investment in risk mitigation is influenced by cost-benefit analysis. Government support for social costs incurred by terrorist attacks is expected by many CI owner-operators. Challenges in DHS partnership efforts include barriers to information sharing, sharing assessment results, and evaluating performance. DHS lacks data on industry participation in security surveys and the effectiveness of security improvements. GAO highlighted the need for measures to evaluate program effectiveness. The GAO highlighted the need for measures to evaluate the effectiveness of partnership activities in critical infrastructure sectors. Congress may explore the progress of DHS in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to assess the effectiveness of industry information sharing and risk reduction investments. CISA and its predecessors have not provided reliable data on the reach and effectiveness of public-private partnership programs in promoting bidirectional information sharing and national-level resilience. Congress may address gaps in national level resilience by introducing appropriate reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies. Recent legislation like FIRRMA expands jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the trade system. Oversight is needed where regulatory authorities exist but are not exercised, such as in the case of TSA. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for infrastructure security. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for infrastructure security, but Congress may need to consider adjusting or replacing these structures to better align with the federal risk management approach. This approach emphasizes inter-sectoral analysis and resilience over sector-specific asset protection."
