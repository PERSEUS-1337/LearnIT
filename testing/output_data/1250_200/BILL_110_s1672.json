    "content": "The VA Vision Scholars Act of 2007 establishes the Visual Impairment and Orientation and Mobility Professionals Education Assistance Program under Chapter 80 of title 38, United States Code. The VA Vision Scholars Act of 2007 establishes a scholarship program to provide financial assistance for individuals studying visual impairment or orientation and mobility. The purpose is to increase the supply of qualified blind rehabilitation specialists for the Department and the Nation. The scholarship program established under the VA Vision Scholars Act of 2007 aims to increase the number of qualified blind rehabilitation specialists for the Department and the Nation. The Secretary will promote the program to educational institutions, with a focus on those with high numbers of Hispanic students and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. To apply, individuals must submit an application and agreement for obligated service in return for educational assistance. The Secretary distributes application and agreement forms for the scholarship program, including a summary of rights and liabilities, terms and conditions, and approval notification. The amount of financial assistance covers tuition and fees for individuals in the program. The financial assistance provided under this chapter covers tuition and fees for individuals pursuing dual degrees or certifications. The total assistance for a full-time student cannot exceed $15,000 per academic year, and for part-time students, it is proportional to the coursework carried out. The financial assistance provided under this chapter covers tuition and fees for individuals pursuing dual degrees or certifications, with a maximum total assistance of $45,000. The Secretary may provide assistance for up to six years, and an agreement between the Secretary and participant must be signed, outlining the terms of financial assistance and academic requirements. The chapter outlines requirements for participants in an educational assistance program, including maintaining academic standing, serving as a full-time employee in the Department for three years after completion of the program, and other terms determined by the Secretary. Failure to meet the agreement terms will result in repayment of the unearned assistance to the Secretary. The Secretary establishes repayment procedures for unmet agreement terms in the educational assistance program, allowing exceptions in certain circumstances. Waiver or suspension of obligations may be granted for uncontrollable situations or in the best interest of the United States. Any repayment obligation is considered a debt to the United States, not discharged by bankruptcy. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not release a person from debt if the discharge order is within five years of the termination of the agreement. Clerical amendments are made to the tables of chapters in title 38. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement chapter 80 of title 38, United States Code, within six months of the enactment of this Act."
