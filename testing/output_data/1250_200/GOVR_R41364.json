President Obama proposed to retain lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but increase rates for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were temporarily extended through 2012 and finally resolved in 2013 with the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The final resolution in 2013 raised capital gains taxes for higher-income individuals, with thresholds set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from this increase is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated a revenue increase of $16 billion in FY2019 by allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire, while the Congressional Budget Office projected an increase from 13.3% to 17.9% in the effective capital gains tax rate from 2008 to 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. Assumptions about behavioral responses are the main factor affecting the reduction in projected revenues. Some supporters propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to address potential behavioral responses and eliminate realization response for affected assets. Look-back treatment could be applied to assets that are less easily valued to achieve the same after-tax earnings. Realizations responses in revenue projections by revenue-estimating agencies were publicly discussed in the 1980s. It is important to understand the limits of behavioral assumptions on options for increasing taxes on realized capital gains. The report discusses how realizations responses impact revenue projections and the debate surrounding it in the late 1980s. It suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire due to taxpayers delaying realizations to avoid taxes. This behavior could lead to a loss in revenue if the response is significant enough. The elasticity of capital gains realizations responses determines the impact of tax rate changes on revenue. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss from tax changes. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if it is greater than one, the increase loses revenue. The ratio of revenue gain projected to the gain realized with no behavioral response is one minus the elasticity. The elasticity of capital gains realizations responses determines the impact of tax rate changes on revenue. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent, short-run, and transitory. The transitory effect may occur due to varying incomes of wealthy individuals and pre-announced tax changes. The discussion focuses on the short-term realizations elasticity in response to tax rate changes. Taxpayers may shift realizations into the current year to take advantage of lower tax rates before an increase. Short-term responses may be muted if there has been a recent surge in realizations due to pre-announced tax changes. The discussion focuses on short-term responses to tax rate changes, with a focus on the lack of significant short-run response to tax cuts in 1990 due to exhausted accrued gains. Short-term responses to tax increases that are not pre-announced are not expected to cause a contraction in realizations. Transitory responses, occurring due to temporary rate changes, can lead to significant realizations, as seen in 1986 and 2012. The discussion focuses on short-term responses to tax rate changes, with a focus on the lack of significant short-run response to tax cuts in 1990 due to exhausted accrued gains. Transitory responses occur among individuals even in years when the law does not change, especially prior to 1987 when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. Elasticities of capital gains realizations are expected to be negative, with the percentage change in gains divided by a percentage change in tax rates rising proportionally with the tax rate. The discussion focuses on capital gains tax rates and their elasticities, with a focus on revenue-maximizing tax rates. The current law includes rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%, along with a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. Estimates show an overall marginal tax rate of around 21% for long-term capital gains. These issues do not apply to taxes on dividends. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to reduce the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies began to investigate behavioral responses in the form of realizations elasticities. The issue of revenue cost was crucial due to strict budget constraints at that time. Different elasticities were used by the Administration and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Two types of data were used to estimate the realizations response. Estimates of the realizations response varied from 0.3 to almost 4, with different studies showing a range of elasticities. Aggregate time series estimates ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual taxpayer data estimates ranged from 0.55 to. Estimates of the realizations response varied from 0.3 to 3.8, with different studies showing a range of elasticities. The range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of estimation methods, particularly for individual taxpayer data. Researchers faced challenges in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses when using individual data for estimation. The problem of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in tax rates was addressed by using panel data to separate elasticities. Studies reported smaller but still significant elasticities, with some well above one. Panel studies produced a narrower range of results due to an incorrectly reported elasticity. The panel studies available at the time influenced the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity than suggested by aggregate time series data. Attempts to address transitory effects with panel studies may not fully correct for these effects, as periods of higher or lower income can persist for several years. Panel estimates could still be too large, while biases in time-series estimates remained uncertain. Ultimately, proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates after a sharp spike in realizations in 1986. Realizations rose significantly, then fell the following year, raising concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. After a sharp spike in realizations in 1986, concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies arose. Additional academic studies on realizations response starting in 1990 were identified, with estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury included in Table 1. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to the realizations response, noting that realizations could not exceed a certain threshold for a permanent elasticity. Gravelle's study found a limit to the realizations response, with a maximum elasticity of 0.5. This implies that without taxes and transaction costs, individuals would sell every asset every year. However, in reality, the elasticity is likely to be lower due to various factors such as satisfaction with investments and reluctance to sell certain assets like controlling shares in corporations or family businesses. The study from 1991 analyzed data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realization to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a 48% ratio and a 17.3% tax rate, supporting previous findings. A panel study suggested that without taxes and costs, realizations could increase significantly, but the actual elasticity is lower due to factors like satisfaction with investments and reluctance to sell certain assets. The panel studies in the 1980s corrected the elasticity to 3.2, similar to cross-section results. Burman and Randolph's study used state tax rates to estimate elasticity, finding a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the approach with similar results. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, falling below the upper limit of elasticities. Auten and Joulfaian, Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen conducted individual panel studies with high significance. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with Auten and Joulfaian, Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen having the highest elasticities. These studies added state tax rates and had longer panels, emphasizing time series effects. However, their estimates may still reflect transitory responses rather than permanent ones. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study also provided sensitivity analysis, resulting in a wide range of estimates. The studies on elasticity of state tax rates ranged from 1.8 to 8.0, with some using aggregate time series data and others using state data. The number of years added to time series data seemed to affect the elasticity estimates. Some studies fell within the range of eight time series studies from the 1980s, while others were above the upper limit. Additionally, two state studies showed slightly higher results than the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. The elasticity of state tax rates varied from 1.8 to 8.0 in different studies, with some using aggregate time series data and others using state data. Two state studies showed results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle, indicating that the revenue gained from increasing the tax rate on capital may be understated by current estimates. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019, based on CBO projections and elasticities from Table 1. The estimates range from a reduction of 26% to 97% of the static gain, with a revenue gain ranging from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year. This highlights the interest in adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method to eliminate the realizations response and increase capital. The curr_chunk discusses different studies on the elasticity of capital gains taxes, with varying estimates and methodologies. The Auten and Joulfaian study shows an increase in capital gains revenues with a five-percentage-point tax increase. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity estimates, indicating fragility in the results. The Eichner and Sinai study includes more years than others, suggesting different results. The elasticity of capital gains taxes has been studied by various researchers, with differing estimates and methodologies. The results suggest that revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points are likely, with potential underestimations in current revenue projections. Studies indicate that the revenue gains could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, and even 45% larger using upper limit estimates. This suggests that current projections may underestimate the potential revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates. The appendix explains the method of calculating taxes under the look-back method using a semi-log function. It estimates the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes, showing that revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates may be understated. The appendix explains calculating taxes under the look-back method using a semi-log function. It estimates the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes, showing that revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates may be understated. Negative values are restated in absolute value by adding a minus sign. The revenue equation is written as R = tAe -bt, with the revenue maximizing tax rate at 1/b. The look-back method decreases basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if the tax had been paid on an accrual basis. The appendix discusses calculating taxes using the look-back method with a semi-log function. It shows that revenue gains from raising capital gains tax rates may be underestimated. The revenue equation is R = tAe -bt, with the optimal tax rate at 1/b. The look-back method reduces basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. Additionally, the appendix presents elasticities of realizations with tax rates from studies in the 1980s, categorized by approach used. The debate over statistical studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates involves challenges in data type selection. Aggregate time series results range from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual data estimates vary from 0.55 to almost 4. Individual data is preferred due to information loss and potential bias in aggregate data. The challenges in data selection for statistical studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates include difficulties in controlling for changes over time that can affect results. Problems with individual data sets lead many researchers to believe that aggregate time series results are more reliable. The effective capital gains tax rate, used as an explanatory variable in regressions, is actually influenced by realizations, posing a serious econometric issue. Different techniques, such as using the first dollar tax rate or maximum statutory rates, could address this problem.

The effective capital gains tax rate, used as an explanatory variable in regressions, is actually influenced by realizations, posing a serious econometric issue. Different techniques, such as using the first dollar tax rate or maximum statutory rates, could address this problem. Endogeneity issues are more severe in individual cross-section data due to individual circumstances, while less important in aggregate time series data where variation is mainly from changes in the law. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data is a challenge due to fluctuating income and varying tax rates over time. Individuals may time realizations to coincide with low rates or cash in assets during periods of low income. Since the 1980s, studies have attempted to address the issue of low effective capital gains tax rates using panel studies. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their six-year small panel study, confirming potential problems with previous studies. The study suggests that short panels also have significant issues, with elasticities exceeding 5 in some cases. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their panel study, similar to previous studies from the 1980s. Results varied over time periods, with statistically insignificant findings. Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis, making changes in approach. They used an instrumental variables technique to replicate results from a CBO study. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) suggested three changes to improve their analysis. They proposed using taxes on predicted gains as an instrument, using the maximum tax rate as an instrument, and differencing the data. These changes resulted in higher coefficients and elasticities, but some were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989 also produced different estimates. The study in 1986 found estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 using different methods, with corresponding elasticities. The use of the maximum tax rate as an instrument raised concerns due to changes in the law over time. Burman and Randolph (1994) reported a coefficient of 3.4 in their analysis. The Burman and Randolph study in 1994 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a statistically insignificant effect due to limited tax rate variation. They also estimated a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Several subsequent studies, including Bogart and Gentry (1995) and Auerbach and Siegel (2000), used state tax rates to identify permanent responses. Bogart and Gentry reported an elasticity of 0.65, while Auerbach and Siegel found an elasticity of 0.33. The tax rate used in these studies was estimated to be around 25%. Based on Auerbach and Siegel's findings, the tax rate is estimated to be around 25%. They reported a coefficient of 1.126, suggesting an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate, similar to Burman and Randolph's results. Auerbach and Siegel also found a transitory elasticity of 4.9 at a 22% rate. Their alternative specification showed a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33. However, the addition of the current first dollar rate likely introduced a transitory element, leading to the larger elasticity. The study extends time series analysis through 1997, finding it important to exclude 1986 from the estimates. Excluding both 1986 and 1997, the coefficient is 2.18, with an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Different specifications were tried, including an instrumental variables method using the top marginal tax rate, resulting in an estimate of 3.8 and an elasticity of 0.84. Excluding 1997 led to a coefficient of 5.13 and an elasticity of 1.13. The authors analyzed the top marginal tax rate and average tax rate differences before 1986, with elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. However, most tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant. They reported a coefficient of 2.28 in Table 1. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with a lower elasticity estimate compared to short panels from the 1980s. The study by Evans (2009) uses cross-section regression with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, while Bakija and Gentry (2014) analyze a 50-year panel of state data on tax rates. The findings highlight the limitations of cross-section studies and the need to consider both permanent and transitory effects in estimating tax elasticities. Bakija and Gentry (2014) analyze a 50-year panel of state data on tax rates, using state- and time-fixed effects to control for unobserved differences across states. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) use a 10-year panel with year-fixed effects to estimate transitory elasticities. Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) conduct an aggregate time series study. Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) conducted an aggregate time series study with Australian data from 1988 to 2015, analyzing the impact of changes in capital gains tax rates. The study included sensitivity analysis and controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index. Various citations to studies from the 1980s were also included in the appendix. The curr_chunk discusses various studies on the effects of capital gains taxation, including research by Auten and Clotfelter, the Congressional Budget Office, Darby, Gillingham, Feldstein, and others. These studies analyze the impact of capital gains tax rates on income distribution, tax revenues, stock selling behavior, and capital gains realization. Various studies on the effects of capital gains taxation have been conducted, analyzing the impact of tax rates on income distribution, tax revenues, stock selling behavior, and capital gains realization. Some of the key studies include those by Jones, Lindsey, Minarik, Auerbach, Siegel, Auten, and Joulfaian.
