    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002\". Congress finds that nanotechnology offers unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities in various fields such as materials, electronics, medicine, energy, and national security. Long-term, high-risk research is essential for technological breakthroughs, requiring government funding. Advancements in nanotechnology from government funding will create technologies supporting Federal government work and mission agencies, with a potential market exceeding $1 trillion in the US. Mastering nanotechnology will require a unique skill set for scientists and engineers. Research on nanotechnology creates unprecedented capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment, leading to novel social, ethical, philosophical, and legal issues that require reflection and guidance responsive to the science. Additional research is needed to predict, understand, and alleviate anticipated problems for achieving and maintaining international leadership in nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) aims to coordinate Federal nanotechnology research and development programs to achieve and maintain international leadership in nanotechnology. Authorizing legislation can establish new technology goals, improve agency coordination, ensure optimal returns on investments, and simplify reporting processes for the Executive Branch and Congress. The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board, referred to as the Advisory Board, is established to provide advice on research investment policy, strategy, program goals, and management processes related to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The Advisory Board will operate in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The President, with the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish procedures to appoint up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia to serve on the Advisory Board for nanotechnology. Members will have expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology and the President will consider recommendations from various sources in selecting them. A Chairperson will be designated by the President. The President will appoint up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia to serve on the Advisory Board for nanotechnology. Members will have expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology and serve for 1 to 3 years. The Chairperson, designated by the President, will serve for a term of 3 years. Members will receive travel expenses for meetings held at least twice a year. The President will establish a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to support the Advisory Board and coordinate Federal nanotechnology activities. The staff of this office will be appointed according to civil service laws and paid based on classification and pay rates. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program's goals, research needs, performance metrics, and increasing investments in nanoscale technology and biology research. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of programs for developing new instruments for nanoscience, fostering industrial partnerships for commercializing nanotechnology, addressing workforce issues, and coordinating nanoscale research efforts among Federal agencies and the Department of Defense. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for a balanced Federal nanotechnology research effort, consultation with various entities, and consideration of societal implications. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Advisory Board must submit an annual report to the President, agency heads, and congressional committees. The report should cover the program's technical success, management and coordination, funding levels, and portfolio balance. The Advisory Board's annual report should include a review of the program's goals, challenges, portfolio balance, participation by minority institutions, policy issues related to nanotechnology, recommendations for new goals and research areas, and investment recommendations for the next 5 years. The annual report by the Advisory Board includes recommendations for new investments in program funding areas for the next 5 years, reviews on pertinent issues, and a technology transition study evaluating the success of transitioning research and technologies into commercial and military products in the nanotechnology sector. The Advisory Board's annual report includes recommendations for new investments in program funding areas for the next 5 years and a technology transition study on barriers and recommendations for promoting rapid technology transition in the nanotechnology sector. SEC. 8. TERMINATION. Section 14(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to this Act. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as may be necessary are authorized to carry out this Act."
