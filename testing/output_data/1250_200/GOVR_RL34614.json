    "content": "Nanotechnology focuses on understanding and exploiting unique properties of matter at nanoscale. Congress is concerned about protecting human health and the environment. Research has raised concerns about potential environmental and health implications of nanoscale materials. The Federal government may use research, regulation, and international engagement to address these issues. The rise of nanotechnology products has sparked hopes for beneficial applications but also raised concerns about potential adverse implications for the environment and human health. There is a focus on protecting the health and safety of those working with nanoscale materials and understanding the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes. EHS concerns primarily revolve around engineered nanomaterials intentionally designed and produced. Issues surrounding the potential EHS implications of nanotechnology emerged with the launch of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2000. The federal government has invested approximately $14.2 billion in nanotechnology R&D between FY2001 and FY2011, with additional private sector investments exceeding government funding in 2008. Many governments worldwide have established their own national nanotechnology programs, with global R&D investments estimated at over $17 billion in 2008. Some observers suggest insufficient information on potential effects of nanotechnology products on human health, safety, and the environment due to large investments in nanotechnology. Concerns include transport of nanoscale particles in air, water, and soil, their chemical and biological reactions, distribution, deposition, and potential accumulation in plants or animals. Others argue that EHS concerns are often exaggerated, citing embedded nanoscale materials in manufacturing processes, nanotechnology products without nanoscale particles, and the replacement of risky materials with nanotechnology materials. Some stakeholders believe that additional research is needed to assess the risks of nanoscale materials, as highlighted in congressionally-mandated reviews. Precautionary measures are recommended to protect health and safety until more information is available. Concerns include characterizing toxicity, managing risks, and addressing potential detrimental effects of nanoscale materials and devices. The report discusses the environmental, health, and safety challenges of nanotechnology, emphasizing the need to address EHS concerns. It identifies issues such as toxicity characterization, risk assessment, and environmental interactions. Congressional actions and federal agencies' roles in nanotechnology regulation are also highlighted. For more information, refer to CRS reports by John F. Sargent. Nanotechnology offers economic and societal benefits but also poses environmental, health, and safety challenges. Similar to past technologies like automobiles and genetically-modified plants, nanotechnology has the potential for both positive and negative impacts. Advocates believe that risks can be managed through engineering solutions. Nanotechnology advocates believe it can reduce risks and offer EHS benefits such as energy efficiency, pollution reduction, and disease prevention. Nanoscale materials show promise in environmental remediation and health diagnostics. In the field of human health, nanotechnology is seen as a promising tool for improving disease diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has launched a significant initiative focused on applying nanotechnology to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Nanoscale particles have unique properties that can be tailored for beneficial purposes but also pose unknown risks. Nanotechnology materials have both beneficial and harmful effects. For example, nanoscale silver is effective as an antibacterial agent but could harm vital microbes in the environment. Some nanoscale particles may penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which can hinder or aid in delivering therapeutic agents. Nanoscale materials have potential benefits in delivering medicine directly to the brain but may also pose risks by passing through the blood-brain barrier. Some nanoparticles are highly reactive and can be used in various applications like catalysis and protective gear, but there are concerns about potential cell damage. Carbon nanotubes have diverse uses but some exhibit properties similar to asbestos fibers. Nanotechnology encompasses various scientific fields and applications, with concerns raised about certain carbon nanotubes resembling asbestos fibers and posing health risks. While knowledge about nanomaterial properties and applications has advanced, there is still a lack of understanding on the potential adverse effects on human health and the environment, highlighting the need for further research. The 2006 National Research Council and the 2008 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reports concluded that assessing potential nanotechnology EHS risks was not possible due to lack of information and tools. Research is needed to develop risk assessment protocols for engineered nanomaterials. Nanotechnology products may pose new risks to human health and the environment due to their ability to penetrate inaccessible areas in the body. Nanoscale particles can penetrate inaccessible areas in the body, potentially causing harm. Leaders emphasize the importance of addressing societal and ethical issues in nanotechnology to ensure human well-being and maximize benefits. Lack of scientific evidence on EHS risks may hinder innovation and commercialization in nanotechnology. The lack of detailed scientific evidence on EHS risks in nanotechnology may hinder innovation and commercialization. Uncertainty surrounding potential risks could erode confidence among investors, businesses, and consumers, leading to regulatory challenges and industry reluctance to adopt nanotechnology. Consumer and advocacy groups have already expressed concerns about the use of engineered nanomaterials in various products. It is crucial to conduct thorough evaluations of the health and environmental effects of nanomaterials to ensure the future success of nanotechnology. The importance of understanding the effects of engineered nanomaterials to avoid uncertainties and potential risks is emphasized by business leaders in the field of nanotechnology. Addressing potential health and environmental risks associated with nanotechnology is crucial, as bad practices could lead to negative consequences such as public opposition and government concerns. Successfully managing EHS issues is vital for those exposed to nanoscale materials and for the overall success of nanotechnology. The importance of understanding the effects of engineered nanomaterials is crucial for protecting human health, safety, and the environment. It is essential for businesses, investors, and the general public to ensure public confidence in nanotechnology and prevent negative consequences. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology could enable innovation and contribute to a strong economy by accurately assessing risks and benefits. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for fostering innovation and economic growth. If not handled effectively, it could hinder innovation, economic growth, and job creation, as well as pose a threat to health, safety, and the environment. This could drive investment capital away from nanotechnology, prevent the development of beneficial products, and allow unsafe products to enter the market. Alternatively, a more predictable, efficient, and less costly regulatory system may attract investors and companies, leading to increased investments, research, and production in nanotechnology. The regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for fostering innovation and economic growth. A predictable, efficient regulatory system may attract investors and companies, leading to increased investments in nanotechnology. International coordination on EHS research could help address nanotechnology EHS concerns worldwide. International coordination on EHS research is essential for addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns worldwide, as it can accelerate the development of a common body of knowledge and inform regulatory decision-making. Regulations, standards, and enforcement need to be coordinated globally to protect workers and consumers along global supply chains. Agency nanotechnology budgets are developed internally and reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget before becoming part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The NNI budget, including the EHS component, is determined by aggregating nanotechnology appropriations from Congress to federal agencies. Decision-making for nanotechnology EHS research funding is decentralized. In FY2010, EHS research received $91.6 million, representing 5.1% of the total NNI budget. President Obama requested $116.9 million (6.6%) for EHS research in FY2011. The NNI budget for FY2011, as shown in Table 1, does not fully reflect EHS research investments. PCAST agrees that separating EHS research from application research is unproductive. Detailed reporting on EHS relevance may hinder prioritization. OMB's 2007 request highlighted undercounting of EHS research funding. The OMB's 2007 request revealed undercounting of EHS research funding, with NNI agencies spending nearly twice as much on EHS research in FY2006 than previously reported. Critics argue that federal nanotechnology EHS research funding is too low, while executive branch officials claim the US leads in EHS funding. Executive branch officials emphasize that the United States leads in EHS funding, with significant investments in nanotechnology development and research on health and safety issues. NNI agencies are estimated to have invested nearly $180 million in EHS research from 2005 to 2008, surpassing other countries. Both the NRC and PCAST recommend expanding federal EHS research funding to ensure responsible nanotechnology development. The development of nanotechnology requires expanded research on environmental, health, and safety effects. PCAST acknowledges the importance of adequate funding and targeted research for strategic nanotechnology EHS issues. Funding for EHS research should grow in line with NNI research strategy and available research capacity. The NNI needs to support exploratory research into biological and environmental interactions with nanomaterials to address emerging EHS issues effectively. PCAST credits substantial funding increases for nanotechnology EHS research by the NNI, benefiting agencies like FDA and CPSC. Recommendations include allocating a fixed percentage of NNI funding for EHS research, with a proposed figure of 10%. One recommendation to address the perceived shortcoming in EHS funding is to require a fixed percentage of the NNI's total funding for EHS research. Organizations like the NanoBusiness Alliance and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies propose allocating 10% of the NNI's funding for EHS research. If this proposal had been in effect in FY2010, the NNI would have been required to spend $178.1 million on EHS research, nearly double the NSET-reported level of $91.6 million. Sean Murdock, executive director of the NanoBusiness Alliance, emphasized the importance of fully funding environmental, health, and safety research based on a clear research strategy, advocating for cross-agency flexibility to achieve the 10% funding level. In contrast to fixed percentage or dollar amount proposals for EHS research funding, PCAST advocates for a strategic approach guided by scientifically determined priorities and needs. They caution against rapid funding increases, emphasizing the importance of high-quality research growth. EHS research also relies on advancements in non-EHS areas like instrumentation development and nanomaterials research. Some NGOs advocate for a cautious approach to nanotechnology research, expressing concerns about potential risks to human health and the environment. They call for regulatory action based on the precautionary principle due to insufficient knowledge of EHS implications. Friends of the Earth warned about nanotoxicity in 2006 and suggested a moratorium on the commercial release of products containing nanomaterials. The ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the commercialization of products containing nanomaterials until safety studies are completed and regulations are in place. They also recommend a halt on nanotechnology R&D and the use of products with man-made nanoparticles due to concerns about contamination in living organisms. The ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the commercialization of products containing nanomaterials until safety studies are completed and regulations are in place. They also recommend a halt on nanotechnology R&D and the use of products with man-made nanoparticles due to concerns about contamination in living organisms. In contrast, a report by the NSET Subcommittee suggests conducting EHS research alongside nanomaterial development to ensure safe and responsible use of nanotechnology. Former Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, Phillip J. Bond, argued against a moratorium on nanotechnology R&D, stating that it would be unethical to not harness the potential benefits of nanotechnology to address various issues. In managing the Federal EHS portfolio, policymakers must establish research priorities for assessing the effects of engineered nanomaterials on public health and the environment. Research should focus on estimating exposure, assessing effects on human health and ecosystems, and managing risks associated with exposure. Priority should be given to workplace exposure, as workers involved in manufacturing or handling nanomaterials face the greatest risk of exposure. In February 2008, the NSET published the Federal Strategy for Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials, outlining the NNI's EHS research strategy and identifying lead agencies for research categories. The NRC independently reviewed this strategy document in 2009, acknowledging the collaboration and coordination involved in its creation. The NRC review of the NSET's EHS research report highlighted concerns about poorly defined research needs in risk management and exposure assessment, lack of concrete objectives, overstated federal funding for nanotechnology-related EHS issues, flawed gap analysis approach, and dominance of funding by agencies focused on exploratory research. The NRC emphasized the need for a national strategy involving various stakeholders to address research gaps in EHS risk management. Stakeholders advocate for a multi-year roadmap with specific milestones and metrics to guide federal EHS research efforts. The lack of an NNI roadmap for federal EHS research has hindered progress. Stakeholders call for a multi-year roadmap with specific milestones and funding levels to coordinate efforts. NNI officials have developed an EHS research strategy but acknowledge the need for a more detailed roadmap. Some Members of Congress are concerned about delays in producing an implementation plan. Opposition to an EHS roadmap is based on doubts about its practicality and effectiveness. Opposition to an EHS roadmap is primarily due to doubts about its practicality and efficacy. Some suggest the National Academies produce the roadmap instead of agencies to overcome obstacles. This approach has been successful in developing a federal research roadmap for reducing EHS uncertainties related to airborne particulate matter. In February 2007, various organizations requested $1 million for a federal research roadmap and strategy to address EHS uncertainties related to nanotechnology. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged the EPA to collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences for this purpose. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged the EPA to collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to develop a research roadmap for environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology. The National Academies' Board on Environmental Science and Toxicology initiated a project sponsored by the EPA to produce two reports over four years, focusing on research priorities, progress monitoring, and resource estimates. The second report, due in July 2013, will evaluate research progress, update priorities and resource estimates in nanotechnology. Management concerns arise from the process used to develop research priorities and the federal EHS budget. PCAST recommended organizational changes to support cross-agency action on EHS issues within the NNI. The NNCO established a new position to lead interagency coordination efforts in EHS. The NNCO established a new position in 2010 with the titles of Deputy Director and EHS Coordinator to coordinate EHS research among NNI agencies. The Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies advocates for a top-down approach in federal EHS research, calling for a master plan to identify and reduce potential risks. Recommendations include a top-down risk research strategy, increased funding for EHS, and empowering the NEHI working group to develop and implement the research plan. E. Clayton Teague, director of the NNCO, testified before Congress in support of these recommendations. According to E. Clayton Teague, director of the NNCO, a centralized office overseeing the NNI's EHS research program would have negative effects. He argued that no single agency or centralized organization could match the expertise and regulatory knowledge of the 20 agencies involved in the NEHI working group. Creating a separate office could discourage mission agencies from conducting nanotechnology-related EHS research, leading to a potential decrease in research levels. Creating a separate office for overseeing nanotechnology research could lead to a decrease in research levels and wastage of resources. Andrew Maynard suggests that a functional structure with top-down leadership is necessary for effective coordination among agencies. Concerns have been raised about the regulatory system's ability to keep pace with technological advances in nanotechnology. The regulatory system may struggle to keep up with advances in nanotechnology due to the rapid pace of global innovation driven by market forces, increased R&D investments, and global models of innovation. This poses challenges for existing regulatory systems, especially in the face of the rapid growth in public and private investments in nanotechnology research. Nanotechnology's rapid growth in R&D investments since 2000 poses unique challenges to the regulatory system, especially regarding the impact of particle size on material properties. Questions arise about incorporating particle size into regulatory regimes to address EHS concerns. Some experts believe existing laws can handle EHS concerns about nanotechnology products, while others see legal obstacles. PCAST concluded that current regulatory authorities are sufficient, but more funding and coordination between agencies are needed for effective nanotechnology regulation. Some experts argue for increased funding and coordination for nanotech EHS research and the establishment of metrics and standards. Others suggest new laws or modifications to existing ones may be necessary. J. Clarence Davies highlights the challenges of regulating nanotechnology under current laws, citing shortcomings in legal authority and resources. A new law may be needed to manage potential risks of nanotechnology, requiring manufacturers to submit a sustainability plan to ensure products are safe. Nanotechnology poses challenges to current regulatory methods, leading to calls for a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection for better oversight. Davies proposed a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection to oversee nanotechnology regulation, incorporating existing agencies and new units for various assessments. The need for new mechanisms and institutional capabilities was emphasized to promote beneficial applications of nanotechnology. Concerns were raised about the ambiguity surrounding regulations, hindering commercialization efforts. The safety regulation of nanoparticles is hindering commercialization as firms seek a clear roadmap from federal agencies like the EPA and OSHA. There is tension between promoting nanotechnology development, ensuring US competitiveness, addressing potential health and safety implications, and navigating regulatory challenges. Some suggest health and safety research should keep pace with product development to prevent innovation hurdles, while others argue for prior EHS research and regulation to avoid potential harm. Ian Illuminato from Friends of the Earth and Bill Kojola from AFL-CIO emphasize the importance of EHS research and regulation before the commercialization of nanotechnology. They warn that without mandatory workplace measures to assess exposures, train workers, and implement control measures, potential health hazards could pose risks. The National Research Council and PCAST also stress the need for additional EHS data to inform risk-based guidelines and precautionary measures to protect workers, the public, and the environment. PCAST emphasized the importance of considering risk research in the context of overall risks and benefits of nanotechnology products. They advocated for regulatory decisions to balance potential risks against benefits and not hold nanotechnology products to a higher standard. PCAST also highlighted the responsibilities of manufacturers and sellers in ensuring workplace and product safety, with the NNI supporting federal regulatory agencies with EHS research results. International engagement on EHS issues was deemed crucial for responsible development and commercialization of nanotechnology, with the United States playing a central role in convening international efforts. In its assessments, PCAST encouraged international coordination to avoid duplication and leverage investments in nanotechnology. Federal agencies have engaged internationally in nanotechnology-related areas, including EHS research. The NSET established the GIN working group to monitor foreign nanotechnology programs and promote U.S. interests in nanotechnology. International engagement offers benefits like transparency in standards and regulations for global market confidence in nanotechnology products. Increased globalization of production and markets means companies rely on global supply chains. Transparent standards and regulations are crucial for ensuring the integrity of final products, especially in the case of nanotechnology where detection of nanoscale particles can be challenging. Producers and consumers depend on regulatory systems to guarantee the proper production and representation of nanoscale materials throughout the supply chain. The consumers rely on standards and regulatory systems to ensure proper production and representation of nanoscale materials throughout the supply chain. Without these systems, producers may face additional costs for testing, leading to potential market loss and litigation. Internationally agreed standards can improve research comparability, promote regulations for human health and environmental protection, and enhance global R&D collaboration for nanotechnology's economic potential. Efforts to establish a common environment for nanotechnology development and production aim to promote global market access and prevent nations from lowering standards to attract investments. International engagement in EHS research may face challenges such as time, cost, and perceived ineffectiveness, with some arguing that the U.S. dominance in nanotechnology limits contributions from other countries. Swift action in advancing EHS research is advocated, but international collaborations often involve slow processes. Some argue that international engagement in nanotechnology EHS research may be unnecessary due to existing mechanisms for sharing information across borders. Concerns about slowing overall progress and doubts about the goodwill of participating parties are also raised. In 2003, there were questions about calls for a slowdown in nanotechnology R&D to allow other nations to catch up with the U.S. leadership. Advocates and critics agree that addressing environmental, health, and safety implications of nanotechnology is crucial for reaping its full benefits. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how nanoscale materials may impact humans and the environment, necessitating more EHS research. Concerns about revealing competitive strategies and unwanted scrutiny by regulators hinder cooperation in EHS research and sharing of results. In the 111th and 112th Congress, various bills were considered to address nanotechnology EHS issues, but none were enacted. The need for a national EHS research strategy to fill knowledge gaps and identify institutions involved is being debated. The debate on a national EHS research strategy for nanotechnology includes questions on funding, coordination, prioritization, accountability, and information sharing. Discussions also involve the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for agencies to collect more data on nanotechnology products. The debate on a national EHS research strategy for nanotechnology includes questions on funding, coordination, prioritization, accountability, and information sharing. Agencies may need to be more aggressive in collecting data on nanotechnology products. Congress' approach to these issues could impact U.S. leadership in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, societal benefits, public health, safety, and environmental concerns. Five bills in the 111th Congress addressed nanotechnology EHS issues, with provisions similar to H.R. 554. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010 (H.R. 5116) is similar to H.R. 554 from the previous year. H.R. 5116 changes the name of the act and removes the term \"interdisciplinary\" from a provision. H.R. 554 was introduced in 2009 and addressed nanotechnology EHS concerns by revising the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010 directs various entities to address nanotechnology EHS concerns, including establishing a public database of NNI projects, creating a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel, evaluating societal concerns, and appointing an associate director for coordinating federal nanotechnology EHS activities. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 focuses on developing an annual research plan for federal nanotechnology EHS activities, supporting interdisciplinary research centers for EHS research, encouraging public-private partnerships, and promoting environmental, health, and safety education in nanotechnology efforts. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 aims to expand the National Nanotechnology Program by involving the industrial community in developing nanoscale technologies, coordinating research on environmental and safety risks, and transitioning research into commercial products. It also requires agencies to provide funds to support the program. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 expands the National Nanotechnology Program by involving the industrial community in developing nanoscale technologies, coordinating research on environmental and safety risks, and transitioning research into commercial products. It requires agencies to provide funds to support the program, including the development of nanotechnology standards, maintaining a public information database of projects, addressing societal concerns, and coordinating educational activities. The Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 aims to establish a program for investigating the toxicology and effects of nanoscale materials in FDA-regulated products. The bill also focuses on supporting nanotechnology R&D in areas like economic competitiveness, energy production, and health care, as well as addressing ethical and societal issues related to nanotechnology. The Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act, H.R. 820 (111th Congress), authorizes $25 million per year for nanotechnology research from 2011 to 2015. The bill requires the NNCO to develop a research strategy for nanotechnology development and stewardship. Some federal regulatory agencies are addressing environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology, but critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts nanotechnology research and regulates its applications. EPA seeks more information to assess potential EHS impacts of engineered nanoscale materials for risk management. The agency coordinates federal research efforts on nanotechnology EHS issues. The EPA coordinates federal research efforts on nanotechnology EHS issues and works with international organizations on regulatory issues. Multiple statutes govern EPA's authority to regulate nanotechnology materials, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, FIFRA, and TSCA. Important issues have been raised about the application of EPA's authorities to regulate nanotechnology, particularly under TSCA. Several issues revolve around EPA's authority to regulate nanotechnology under TSCA. Producers of new materials must provide EPA with a premanufacture notification. NGOs urge EPA to consider all nanoscale materials as new, but some have the same composition as existing materials. FIFRA may offer EPA more authority to regulate nanotechnology when controlling pests. According to Lynn Bergeson, under TSCA, any use of a substance on the approved inventory list is legitimate, while FIFRA is use-specific. EPA can assess the risk of pesticides regardless of use. In a November 2006 ruling, EPA stated that a device with a substance to prevent pests is considered a pesticide under FIFRA. A washing machine with nanoscale silver ions was the first nanotechnology product regulated under FIFRA, but claims of pesticidal effectiveness were removed from advertisements, limiting EPA's regulation. EPA was found to be missing opportunities to collect additional information on nanotechnology regulation in a May 2010 review by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. In a May 2010 review, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that EPA was missing opportunities to collect additional information under TSCA, FIFRA, and other environmental statutes. FDA regulates various nanotechnology products, including cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, and combination products. Critics argue that FDA's limited regulatory authority may hinder its ability to regulate nanotechnology products effectively. FDA states that its existing requirements may be adequate for most nanotechnology products it expects to regulate, as they are in the same size-range as cells and molecules. The agency mentions that degradable medical devices and injectable pharmaceuticals already generate particulates that pass through the nanoscale size range during absorption and elimination by the body, with no reports of adverse reactions related to the \"nano\" size. However, new tests or requirements may be necessary if new risks are identified from new materials or manufacturing techniques. Consumer groups argue that FDA's resources are insufficient to address the safety of emerging technologies, especially for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and other products. The FDA does not provide grants for nanotechnology research but conducts research to understand nanomaterials. They collaborate with NIEHS on studies and participate in multinational organizations for nanotechnology regulation. NIEHS conducts nanotechnology EHS research to support regulatory agencies. NIEHS conducts nanotechnology EHS research to support regulatory agencies, including the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The NTP's Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) aims to evaluate the toxicological properties of various nanoscale materials and investigate their interactions with biological systems. The NTP's Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) focuses on researching the toxicological properties of nanoscale materials like metal oxides, quantum dots, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanoscale silver, and nanoscale gold. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ensures worker safety by setting and enforcing standards for exposure to nanomaterials in various industries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) aims to protect workers' safety by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, and encouraging workplace safety improvements. OSHA has not taken regulatory actions on nanotechnology yet. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research and provides guidance on the occupational safety implications of nanotechnology. NIOSH collaborates with EPA and is working on new risk management approaches to ensure worker health and safety. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed guidelines for working with nanomaterials based on scientific knowledge of nanoparticle toxicity. NIOSH also maintains a Nanoparticle Information Library as a resource for occupational health professionals. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is responsible for assessing safety and health risks of nanomaterials under existing regulations and guidelines. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) does not require pre-market registration or approval of products, but evaluates a product's risk after distribution. In 2005, CPSC approved a nanotechnology statement highlighting regulatory challenges and the need for unique exposure and risk assessment strategies for nanomaterials. CPSC acknowledges the lack of data on consumer exposure and health effects from nanomaterials."
