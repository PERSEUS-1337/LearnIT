    "content": "The \"Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2006\" establishes a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including an initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. It also addresses applicable laws, requirements, and the availability of funds for the self-determination process. The Congress acknowledges past presidential actions regarding Puerto Rico's political status, including the establishment of a task force to identify options for the territory's future status. President Bush required regular reports on progress in this regard. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status issued a report in 2005 recommending a federally sanctioned plebiscite for Puerto Ricans to vote on remaining a US territory or pursuing a permanent nonterritorial status. If the latter is chosen, a subsequent plebiscite would allow them to choose between two options. Congress is urged to start the process once a majority selects an option. If Puerto Ricans choose to remain a US territory, periodic plebiscites should be held to keep Congress informed of their wishes. SEC. 3. FEDERALLY SANCTIONED PROCESS FOR PUERTO RICO'S SELF-DETERMINATION, INCLUDING INITIAL PLEBISCITE AND SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct a plebiscite in Puerto Rico to choose between continuing the existing territorial status or pursuing a path towards a nonterritorial status. If the majority favors the current status, additional plebiscites will be held every 8 years. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct plebiscites every 8 years unless a majority vote favors a permanent nonterritorial status. If such a status is favored, a plebiscite will be held to choose between statehood or becoming a sovereign nation. If a majority vote favors permanent nonterritorial status, a plebiscite will be held during the 111th Congress, but no later than December 31, 2009. If another plebiscite also favors permanent nonterritorial status, it must be held within 2 years after the certification of the majority vote. SEC. 4. APPLICABLE LAWS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. Federal laws applicable to the election of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico also apply to plebiscites under this Act. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over legal claims related to this Act. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will issue rules for plebiscites. Eligible voters include those under Puerto Rico's electoral laws and US citizens born in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission must ensure compliance with all requirements for voting in a general election, except residency. Eligible voters can request an absentee ballot for plebiscites. The Commission certifies plebiscite results to the President and Congress. After the second plebiscite, a report detailing measures for implementing the chosen nonterritorial status option will be submitted to Congress. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission certifies plebiscite results to the President and Congress. After the second plebiscite, a report detailing measures for implementing the chosen nonterritorial status option will be submitted to Congress. During the period from October 1, 2006, until all required plebiscites are completed, the Secretary of the Treasury can allocate up to $5,000,000 from funds provided to Puerto Rico for plebiscite expenses. This includes voter education materials approved by the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status."
