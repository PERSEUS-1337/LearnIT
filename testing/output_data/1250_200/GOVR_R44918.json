    "content": "Federal financial regulation is complex, with diverse markets, participants, and regulators. The regulatory structure has evolved over time, with major changes made in response to financial crises. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 was a significant reform in response to the 2007 financial turmoil. Congress is currently debating proposals to modify the regulatory system, including the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes to U.S. financial regulation, including modifications to regulatory agencies and funding. It provides an overview of federal regulators, their supervision of institutions, and other entities involved in financial regulation. For more details on regulator structure and funding, refer to CRS Report R43391. The financial system matches savers and investors with borrowers through intermediaries or agents. These firms issue obligations to savers and make loans or investments for profits. Regulators oversee the myriad products, instruments, and markets in banking, insurance, and securities. The financial system involves collecting premiums, making payouts to policyholders, issuing securities, and managing financial market infrastructure. There is a distinction between formal and functional definitions of these activities, leading to regulatory fragmentation. The U.S. regulatory system is fragmented due to tension between formal and functional activities. Financial regulation evolves over time in response to market failures, with varying powers, goals, and approaches across regulators. Financial regulators focus on formal definitions and have different powers and policy goals. Financial regulators implement policy using their powers, which include Licensing, Chartering, or Registration. Activities require proper credentials from state or federal regulators. Each charter, license, or registration governs specific financial activities. Recipients must accept terms and conditions to be granted a license. Financial regulators issue rules through the rulemaking process to implement statutory mandates, outlining guidelines for market participants to comply. Oversight and supervision ensure adherence to rules, allowing regulators to observe behavior and take corrective actions. Failure to meet terms and conditions could result in penalties, license revocation, or criminal charges. Financial regulators oversee behavior through active monitoring or investigating complaints. They can enforce compliance through fines, penalties, and legal actions, and have the power to resolve failing firms by taking control and initiating conservatorship. Financial regulators have the power to resolve failing firms through conservatorship or receivership. Regulation aims to achieve market efficiency, integrity, and consumer protection by addressing market failures and ensuring transparency and enforcement of rules. Financial regulators aim to protect consumers and investors from fraud, discrimination, and exploitation. They also ensure access to credit and capital for firms and consumers, regardless of personal characteristics. Regulators work to prevent illicit activities within the financial system. Financial regulators aim to protect consumers and investors from fraud, discrimination, and exploitation, ensuring access to credit and capital for all borrowers. They also work to prevent illicit activities in the financial system, such as money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorism financing, while safeguarding taxpayers from bearing losses or liabilities in financial markets. Regulators back certain financial activities with federal government support or insurance schemes, like the Deposit Insurance Fund, to prevent government payouts in case of failures. In times of crisis, the government may provide funds to restore stability as a last resort. In times of financial crisis, the government may provide funds in unconventional ways to restore stability, such as bailouts of failing firms. Financial regulation aims to maintain stability by mitigating systemic risk, preventing market freezes, panics, and firm failures. The 2007-2009 financial crisis showed that instability can spread beyond banking to other parts of the financial system, requiring policy intervention to contain damage to the real economy. Regulation aims to balance consumer protections with market efficiency and capital formation. Prudential regulation focuses on ensuring institutions' safety and soundness through risk management, such as capital requirements for banks. Regulatory goals can sometimes conflict, requiring regulators to find a middle ground to minimize burden and maximize benefits. Regulatory actions involve tradeoffs between various objectives. Prudential regulation ensures institution safety through risk management like capital requirements. It aims to protect taxpayers, consumers, and maintain financial stability. Disclosure and reporting provide accurate financial information for informed decisions. Standard setting regulates products, markets, and conduct to achieve policy goals. Regulators set standards for products, markets, and professional conduct to achieve policy goals such as market integrity, taxpayer protection, consumer protection, and suitability. They also ensure competition by preventing monopoly power, collusion, and price fixing. Regulators promote competitive markets for efficiency, integrity, and consumer/investor protections, including policies to prevent firms from being \"too big to fail.\" Price and rate regulations are set by regulators to control maximum or minimum prices, fees, premiums, or interest rates. This type of regulation is more common at the state level, with examples such as state usury laws capping interest rates. At the federal level, the Durbin Amendment caps debit interchange fees for large banks. Price and rate regulations are justified by policymakers for consumer and investor protections. Prudential regulations focus on banking regulation, while securities regulation emphasizes disclosure. This difference in approach is due to the varying importance of regulatory goals such as financial stability and taxpayer protection. Financial stability and taxpayer protection are central to banking due to taxpayer exposure and contagion risks. Prudential regulation relies on confidential information gathered by supervisors. Securities regulation aims to inform investors about risks, not prevent failures. Regulators' purview varies based on financial market characteristics and historical evolution. Some firms are subject to federal regulation based on their business charter. Regulators oversee different categories of financial institutions, such as depository institutions and government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They regulate activities based on the type of institution and market, ensuring compliance with codes of conduct. Regulators oversee various financial institutions and markets, ensuring compliance with codes of conduct. Activities within markets are regulated, with codes of conduct issued by the market itself. Regulators may require specific activities to be conducted only within regulated markets. Different authority or jurisdiction may apply in primary and secondary markets. Another approach is to regulate specific types of transactions across various firms, as seen in the creation of the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act for consumer financial protections. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to oversee financial products offered to consumers by various firms. Different regulatory approaches are necessary to address risks from firms, markets, and products. Market innovation can create new financial instruments that may not fit neatly into existing regulatory categories. Regulators in banking, securities, and insurance oversee different areas of finance, with targeted regulators for specific activities and markets. Jurisdictional disputes between agencies are common, requiring Congress and the courts to intervene. The table in the report outlines regulators overseeing financial firms in different sectors such as banking, securities, and insurance. Financial firms may be regulated by multiple entities due to engaging in various financial activities. Holding companies with separate legal subsidiaries allow for a wider range of activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 brought about regulatory changes impacting financial activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 allowed for financial activities to be segregated in separate legal subsidiaries within financial holding companies. These subsidiaries may have different primary regulators, leading to multiple institution regulators for firms with multiple subsidiaries. Financial holding companies, like a bank holding company, are regulated by the Fed at the holding company level. The financial holding company is regulated by the Fed at the holding company level, with its national bank regulated by the OCC, securities subsidiary by the SEC, and loan company possibly by the CFPB. Regulation of depository institutions in the US involves multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions, including state and federal authorities. Depository institutions have three charter types: commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions. Depository institutions in the US have three charter types: commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions. Each type has a primary federal regulator, such as the OCC for national banks and thrifts, the Federal Reserve for state-chartered banks in the system, and the FDIC for state-chartered thrifts and banks outside the system. Foreign banks are regulated by the Fed or OCC, and credit unions by the National Credit Union Administration. All institutions are also subject to FDIC regulatory authority if their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Banks are regulated under a separate framework from credit unions, with safety and soundness regulations in place to evaluate loans, balance sheets, and overall system risks. They are required to keep capital reserves to ensure stability in case of asset value drops. The financial stability of banks is ensured through capital reserves and liquidity requirements. Federal regulators assess risk through various standards and have tools to mitigate excessive risk-taking. Regulators can enforce measures to restore sound balance sheets, including asset disposal and lending restrictions, with the authority to withdraw deposit insurance or seize the bank if necessary. Banks are also subject to CFPB regulations for consumer protection. The OCC, FDIC, and other banking agencies regulate banks for safety and soundness. The OCC oversees federally chartered banks, with strong enforcement powers including issuing cease and desist orders. The FDIC provides assurance to small banks and was created in 1933 after the Great Depression. The FDIC, created in 1933 after the Great Depression, insures deposits up to $250,000 for individual accounts and supervises financial institutions. It manages receiverships and resolves failed banks, funded by risk-based assessments. The DIF safeguards deposit insurance and is managed by the FDIC. The FDIC examines and regulates all insured depository institutions for safety and soundness. The FDIC examines and regulates insured depository institutions for safety and soundness, while the Federal Reserve System serves as the nation's central bank with regulatory authority over various lending institutions. The FDIC also has powers to resolve troubled banks and other financial institutions, while the Fed's membership is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks. The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States and regulates financial firms, including national banks. Membership in the system is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks. The Fed also serves as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies and is the primary regulator for nonbank financial firms designated as systemically significant. Additionally, the Fed conducts monetary policy and acts as a lender of last resort by providing short-term collateralized loans to banks. The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy by targeting short-term interest rates and acts as a lender of last resort through the discount window. It also regulates the payment system and sets prudential standards for designated payment systems. The NCUA is the safety and soundness regulator for federal credit unions, administers a Central Liquidity Facility, and insures credit union deposits. The CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to enhance consumer protection. The CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to enhance consumer protection by consolidating authority over various consumer financial products and services. It administers rules to protect consumers and serves as the primary federal supervisor and enforcer of consumer protection laws. The CFPB is the primary federal consumer financial protection supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer protection laws. Its regulatory authority varies based on institution size and type, with different rules for depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, those with $10 billion or less, and nondepositories. The bureau can issue rules for all depository institutions but only supervises those with more than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities and activities from the CFPB's authority, such as merchants extending credit for nonfinancial goods or services, automobile dealers, and real estate brokers. The CFPB is the primary federal consumer financial protection supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer protection laws. Its regulatory authority varies based on institution size and type. The SEC and CFTC regulate derivatives and other types of securities. Standard-setting bodies and SROs play a role in securities regulation overseen by the SEC or CFTC. The SEC was created in 1934 to enforce federal securities laws after the stock market crash of 1929. The SEC, established in 1934 after the 1929 stock market crash, enforces federal securities laws and regulates participants in securities markets, securities products, and securities markets. Its focus is on protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. The SEC's main focus is on protecting investors, maintaining fair markets, and facilitating capital formation. Firms selling securities must register with the SEC, providing detailed information about the firm, management, fund usage, and risks to investors. The SEC does not have direct regulatory control over publicly traded firms beyond disclosure requirements and certain rules on corporate governance. The SEC does not have direct regulatory control over publicly traded firms beyond disclosure requirements and certain rules on corporate governance. Registration with the SEC does not guarantee that a security is a good or safe investment. Various securities market participants are required to register with the SEC to protect public investors, prevent fraud, and promote fair markets. The level of investor protection depends on their sophistication. Investor protection depends on sophistication level. Accredited investors with high net worth can invest in riskier funds. Dodd-Frank Act requires registration for private advisers with over $150 million in assets. SIPC insures customer accounts up to $500,000 for brokerage failure or fraud. Unlike FDIC, SIPC does not protect against market losses. The foreign exchange market, with trillions of dollars in daily turnover, lacks U.S. regulatory oversight. Treasury securities were exempted from SEC regulation in the 1930s. In 1993, the Government Securities Act Amendments required brokers and dealers to register as government securities dealers, extended antifraud provisions to government securities brokers, and gave the U.S. Treasury authority to regulate transactions. The government securities market is less regulated than the corporate securities markets, with regulatory jurisdiction fragmented across multiple regulators. The SEC has no jurisdiction over the primary market for Treasury securities. Municipal securities were initially exempt from SEC regulation until the creation of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in 1975. Private securities are not subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements as public securities but are still subject to antifraud provisions. Private placements can only be offered to accredited investors and have restrictions on resale. The private placement market size varies yearly, sometimes exceeding public securities sales. The private placement market size varies yearly, sometimes exceeding public securities sales. Venture capitalists and private equity firms play important roles in corporate finance. The CFTC was created in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, expanding beyond agricultural commodities to financial variables. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted swaps from CFTC regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the exemption of swaps from CFTC regulation due to issues in the financial crisis. It expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction, requiring registration of swap entities and clearing through central clearinghouses. The CFTC aims to prevent speculation, price manipulation, and fraud in commodity markets. The CFTC oversees SROs and requires registration of industry firms and personnel, including brokers, floor traders, commodity pool operators, and trading advisers. It does not directly regulate firm safety, except for specific rules. SROs must create disciplinary rules and ensure market integrity. Dodd-Frank Act gave SEC and CFTC regulatory authority over systemically important clearing and settlement systems. The Dodd-Frank Act granted the SEC and CFTC additional regulatory authority over systemically important clearing and settlement systems. Standard-setting bodies play a crucial role in setting rules for securities and futures markets participants, with organizations like FINRA, MSRB, and NFA overseeing registration, professional conduct standards, and enforcement in their respective markets. The National Futures Association enforces rules in futures markets and conducts fitness examinations for derivatives markets participants. FASB sets financial accounting standards, while PCAOB oversees auditors of publicly held companies. These standard-setting bodies are private nonprofits funded through member fees. GSEs are privately owned institutions with limited missions overseen by dedicated regulators. The FHFA was created in 2008 to regulate GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, succeeding OFHEO and FHFB. It took over setting affordable housing goals from HUD due to concerns about systemic risks posed by the GSEs. The FHFA was established in 2008 to oversee GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, taking over from OFHEO. It has the authority to set capital standards, intervene in risky activities, and place the GSEs in conservatorship if necessary. The Treasury has provided capital to Fannie and Freddie to ensure their solvency, in exchange for a significant ownership stake. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) was created in 1933 during a farming crisis to oversee the Farm Credit System, which includes cooperatively owned Farm Credit Banks and Agricultural Credit Banks. The FCA regulates these institutions for safety and soundness through capital requirements. Unlike housing GSEs, the Farm Credit System operates in both primary and secondary agricultural credit markets. Coordination among regulators has led to the formation of interagency task forces to study market episodes and make recommendations to Congress. The formation of interagency task forces to study market episodes and make recommendations to Congress has been driven by coordination and data sharing among regulators. Three interagency organizations have permanent status: the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council, and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. Regulatory failure is considered to have played a part in the financial crisis, with gaps in oversight and insufficient risk constraints identified as key problem areas. These failures contributed to the worst economic crisis in generations. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to detect systemic risk in the financial system before a crisis occurs. It coordinates with various regulators to identify potential threats to stability and prevent cascading losses with system-wide consequences. The FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes heads of the Fed, FDIC, OCC, and NCUA as voting members. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes heads of various regulatory bodies as voting members. It identifies risks to financial stability, responds to systemic risks, and promotes market discipline to prevent moral hazard. The FSOC collects information on financial firms, monitors the financial system for potential risks, proposes regulatory changes, and facilitates coordination among regulators. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) proposes regulatory changes to Congress to promote stability, competitiveness, and efficiency. It facilitates information sharing among financial regulators, identifies gaps in regulation, and provides a forum for resolving disputes among council members. The FSOC can make regulatory recommendations but cannot impose changes or respond to emerging threats beyond its members' existing authority. It plays a crucial role in regulation despite lacking direct supervisory authority over financial institutions. The FSOC designates systemically important firms and utilities, subjecting them to stricter supervision by the Fed. The FFIEC coordinates federal regulation of lending institutions and issues reporting forms for covered institutions. The FFIEC, consisting of various federal agencies, employs examiners to enforce safety and soundness regulations for lending institutions. Safety and soundness concerns are monitored through handbooks covering areas like capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, and market risk sensitivity. Unlike banks and securities firms, insurance companies have been regulated by states for 150 years due to Supreme Court decisions and congressional actions. In the 1868 case Paul v. Virginia, the Court ruled that insurance was not interstate commerce and not subject to federal regulation. This was reversed in the 1944 U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association decision. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 preserved states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Each state has its own department regulating insurance companies and products. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners sets national standards through model laws, but states must enact them for legal effect. The NAIC sets national standards for insurance regulation, but states must enact them for legal effect. States have guaranty funds to protect policyholders in case of insurer insolvency. Federal government's role in insurance regulation has increased over time, with laws like GLBA and Dodd-Frank Act expanding federal oversight. Federal Reserve regulates bank holding companies with insurance operations and insurers designated as systemically important. Dodd-Frank Act created FIO to monitor insurance industry and represent US internationally. Various federal laws exempt aspects of state insurance regulation. State insurance regulation includes exemptions for certain insurers under federal laws like the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 and the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2015. State regulators oversee banking and securities markets, with a dual system for banking where institutions can choose state or federal charter. State-chartered banks have more institutions but fewer assets compared to nationally chartered banks. Federal regulators still play a role in regulating state-chartered banks. State-chartered banks have state regulators as their primary regulators, but federal regulators also play a role. Most depositories have FDIC deposit insurance and must meet federal safety and soundness standards. State banks may be members of the Fed, giving the Fed supervisory authority over them. Blue sky laws protect investors against fraud in securities markets, with state securities acts focusing on disclosure and qualification. State regulators oversee investment advisers exempt from SEC registration based on size. Broker-dealers are regulated differently. Federal and state regulators oversee investment advisers and broker-dealers in the securities market. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 reduced overlap between state and federal regulations. States, especially those with large financial industries like New York, play a significant role in enforcement actions. Federal preemption and \"wild card\" laws determine the scope of state regulation, with firms registered with the SEC exempt from state registration requirements. Financial regulation must consider both federal and state laws. Financial regulation must consider the global nature of financial markets, with regulators granting equivalency or subjecting foreign firms to domestic regulation. Migration of financial activity to jurisdictions with laxer standards could undermine regulation effectiveness. U.S. regulators participate in international fora to set broad regulatory standards, playing a substantial role in shaping these standards. The U.S. plays a significant role in setting international financial standards through various standard-setting bodies and the Financial Stability Board, created after the financial crisis for regulatory reform coordination. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 created new federal entities related to financial regulation, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Office of Financial Research, Federal Insurance Office, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Act granted new authority to the CFPB and transferred existing authority to it from other regulators. There is significant overlap between the FSB's regulatory reform agenda and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 created new federal entities for financial regulation, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It also eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred its authority to banking regulators. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and eliminated the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight and Federal Housing Finance Board. HERA granted the FHFA new authority and transferred limited authority from the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
