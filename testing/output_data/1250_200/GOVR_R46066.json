Key deliverables included a new Readiness Initiative for rapid deployment of forces, declaration of space as a new operational domain, increased defense spending by European allies, renewed commitment to missions in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts, assessment of China's impact on security, and a new reflection process to strengthen NATO's political dimension. The importance of strong U.S.-European relations was emphasized. The United States has been a driving force behind NATO since its creation in 1949, leading the alliance through various transformations. U.S. leadership in NATO is seen as crucial for national security, providing peace, stability, and support from 28 allies. However, tensions have arisen, with some European allies questioning the Trump Administration's commitment and criticizing unilateral foreign policy decisions. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledges these tensions but emphasizes the importance of continued unity within the alliance. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledges tensions within the alliance but emphasizes transatlantic cooperation has enabled NATO to be more active. Trump Administration officials affirm commitment to NATO, with President Trump highlighting its purpose in London. Increased defense spending is credited to President Trump, with critics attributing it to renewed Russian aggression. NATO leaders in London reaffirm commitment to readiness, deterrence, and addressing emerging security challenges, including declaring space as an operational domain. They also reinforce commitment to NATO's mission in Afghanistan. NATO allies in London reaffirmed their commitment to readiness, deterrence, and addressing emerging security challenges, including declaring space as an operational domain. Efforts to renew NATO's focus on territorial defense and deter Russian aggression have included deploying troops to Baltic States and Poland, increasing military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, and establishing new NATO command structures. Progress was announced on initiatives to enhance NATO's readiness to respond swiftly to an attack on a member, including reinforcing battlegroups and implementing the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative by the end of 2019. Efforts to enhance NATO's readiness include the implementation of the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative by the end of 2019, aiming to have 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval combat vessels ready for use within 30 days. Some allies question the effectiveness of these efforts, with calls for more forces in the region to reinforce deterrence posture. Others emphasize the importance of dialogue with Russia alongside deterrence measures. Efforts to enhance NATO's readiness include the implementation of the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative by the end of 2019, aiming to have 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval combat vessels ready for use within 30 days. Some allies question the effectiveness of these efforts, with calls for more forces in the region to reinforce deterrence posture. Other allies emphasize the importance of dialogue with Russia alongside deterrence measures, highlighting progress in responding to cyber and hybrid threats and formally declaring space as a new operational domain for the alliance. NATO has adopted measures to protect networks from cyberattacks and assist member states in bolstering national cyber defense capabilities, including the availability of Cyber Rapid Reaction Teams and plans to establish a new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels. The new NATO cyber center in Brussels integrates allies' national cyber capabilities into missions and operations, focusing on cyber defense at all levels of planning. NATO aims to counter hybrid warfare threats through strategic communications, exercise scenarios, and coordination with the EU. Counter-hybrid support teams provide tailored assistance to allies, with the first team deployed to Montenegro in 2019. NATO leaders endorsed new baseline requirements for ally resilience. In London, NATO leaders endorsed new baseline requirements for allies regarding the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure, including 5G systems. They also formally declared space as an operational domain for NATO, emphasizing defense and deterrence in all areas, including space. NATO has no intention of deploying weapons in space and will adhere to defensive measures in line with international law. The Trump Administration continues to urge allies to increase their defense budgets to ensure equitable distribution of responsibilities within the alliance. President Trump has urged NATO allies to increase defense spending in line with past agreements. European allies have seen substantial increases in defense spending over the past five years, with credit given to President Trump for spurring these increases. However, critics are concerned that his criticism could harm NATO cohesion. NATO members agreed in 2006 to allocate at least 2% of GDP to defense annually, with a focus on procurement and research. The allies pledged at the 2014 Wales Summit to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade, and defense spending by European allies and Canada has grown for five consecutive years. European allies and Canada have increased defense spending for five consecutive years, adding $130 billion since 2014. By 2024, this figure is expected to reach $400 billion. While some allies have met the 2% guideline, others like Germany are still below the target. Despite criticisms, many allies argue that contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities should also be considered alongside total defense spending levels. The effectiveness of allied military capabilities is crucial, not just total defense spending levels. An ally spending less than 2% of GDP on defense could have more modern military capabilities than one meeting the target but allocating funds mainly to personnel costs. Analysts emphasize the importance of focusing on defense outputs, like military capabilities and contributions to NATO missions. The alliance aims for 20% of each member's defense expenditure to go towards new equipment and research. Secretary General Stoltenberg advocates for a broad approach to measuring contributions, considering \"cash, capabilities, and contributions\" beyond just GDP spending. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds, with the U.S. and Germany each contributing about 16%. The total contributions to NATO's common funds in 2019 were about $2.6 billion, with the U.S. share at 22%. Despite speculation about a possible drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, allies renewed their commitment to NATO's training mission in the country. NATO allies and partners have steadily matched U.S. troop levels in the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. As of February 2020, there were about 8,500 troops from NATO members and partners, with the top contributors being Germany, the UK, Italy, Georgia, and Romania. NATO leaders welcomed agreements for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan and stated that troop reductions would be conditions-based. NATO reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing support for Afghanistan. NATO reaffirms commitment to Afghanistan and ongoing support for Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. European allies emphasize the need for close coordination on drawdown plans. President Trump urges NATO to expand counterterrorism efforts beyond Afghanistan, focusing on threats from the Middle East and North Africa. NATO has launched initiatives like the NATO Training Mission in Iraq and the Package on the South to address terrorism and instability in the MENA region. NATO has established cooperation initiatives with MENA countries like Tunisia and Jordan, and a Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy. Some allies believe the EU should lead Europe's response to terrorism and migration, limiting NATO's engagement in the region. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have urged NATO to assess security implications of Chinese investment in Europe. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have urged NATO to assess the security implications of growing Chinese investment in Europe, particularly in critical infrastructure and telecommunications systems like 5G networks. NATO has adopted a plan to update requirements for civilian telecommunications to address concerns about 5G technology and assess risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. The allies are assessing risks to communications systems related to 5G technology and foreign ownership. The EU is working on guidelines for 5G networks, but individual national governments will make contracting decisions. U.S. officials have warned against using Huawei or other Chinese equipment due to security concerns. Some allies, like the UK and Germany, will not prevent Chinese companies from bidding on contracts but have strict national security requirements. The UK announced restrictions on \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei in sensitive parts of 5G networks. Other countries, such as Poland, are considering excluding Huawei. The UK and Germany have strict national security requirements for 5G networks, with the UK announcing restrictions on \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei. Other countries, such as Poland, are considering excluding Huawei from their telecommunications sector. Despite U.S. concerns about China's growing footprint in Europe, there is optimism for joint U.S.-European efforts to address security and economic issues posed by China. North Macedonia became NATO's 30th member on March 27, 2020, with the U.S. Senate approving ratification on October 22, 2019. Deliberations in London highlighted tension and divergent views within NATO. The U.S. Senate approved U.S. ratification for NATO on October 22, 2019, amidst heightened tension and divergent views within the alliance on various issues. Disagreements on U.S. policy towards NATO, Turkey's membership, EU security, and NATO's relations with Russia have raised concerns about NATO's strategic direction. President Trump's criticism and lack of transatlantic coordination on Syria and Afghanistan have also strained the alliance. In response, NATO allies agreed to initiate a reflection process to strengthen political unity. In an effort to address diverging views within NATO, allies in London agreed to start a reflection process to strengthen NATO's political dimension. Secretary General Stoltenberg appointed a group of 10 experts to recommend ways to reinforce Alliance unity and increase political consultation. Concerns have been raised about President Trump's commitment to NATO and his criticisms of the alliance's value to the United States. President Trump's strong stance on increasing defense spending by NATO allies has raised concerns about the U.S. commitment to the alliance. European allies worry about strategic rifts and lack of coordination, especially in Syria where the U.S. drawdown enabled Turkey's military operations against Kurdish forces. The U.S. drawdown in Syria enabled Turkey's military operations against Kurdish forces, leading to concerns about NATO's coordination. French President Macron criticized the lack of strategic decision-making within NATO, with President Trump defending the alliance. Turkey's actions in Syria have been sharply criticized by some NATO members. Some NATO members have criticized Turkey's military operations in northern Syria and its planned deployment of a Russian S-400 air defense system, questioning Turkey's NATO membership. Turkey has been a member since 1952, participating in various NATO missions and receiving air defense support. NATO has invested in military facilities in Turkey, including naval bases. Secretary General Stoltenberg urged Turkey to act with restraint during a visit in October 2019. Turkey has invoked Article 4 of NATO's treaty three times since 2012 due to perceived threats from Syria. NATO allies expressed solidarity with Turkey in response to air strikes by Syria and Russia in Idlib province. NATO has provided air defense support and surveillance to Turkey along its border with Syria. Some allies have raised doubts about the deployment of air defense systems after Turkey's military incursion into northern Syria. Italy withdrew its system in December 2019, while Spain continues to deploy a Patriot missile battery. Secretary General Stoltenberg has criticized Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system. Spain deploys a Patriot missile battery along Turkey's border. Secretary General Stoltenberg criticizes Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system. Some allied leaders suggest excluding Turkey from NATO's defense systems if it deploys the S-400. The US and other NATO members could take measures to affect cooperation with Turkey. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper plans to urge NATO allies to take diplomatic and economic measures in response to Turkey's actions. French President Macron raises concerns about the future US role in European security. Some European leaders, including French President Macron, argue for developing coordinated European defense capabilities independent of NATO due to uncertainty about the future US role in European security. The EU has been working on its Common Security and Defense Policy to enhance European military capabilities, despite challenges posed by flat or declining defense budgets. Recent EU defense initiatives include the European Defense Fund (EDF) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to improve defense research, development, and spending efficiency. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg supports EU defense integration but emphasizes strengthening the European pillar within NATO. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg supports further EU defense integration and cooperation to strengthen the European pillar within NATO, rather than replace it. He emphasizes that EU defense initiatives should complement NATO efforts and not duplicate capacities. The Trump Administration has concerns about EDF and PESCO potentially limiting U.S. defense company participation in pan-European military projects. Supporters highlight that PESCO projects align with NATO priorities, particularly enhancing military mobility in Europe. Congress has historically shown strong support for NATO, despite occasional criticisms about burden-sharing. During the Trump Administration, congressional support for NATO has been seen as reassuring allies after President Trump's criticisms. Congress has passed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for NATO, with some analysts highlighting the importance of NATO to Congress. Despite disagreements, Congress consistently supports NATO and its mutual defense commitment. Despite disagreements over President Trump's impact on NATO, most Members of Congress continue to express support for robust U.S. leadership of the alliance. Some argue that his criticism has led to increased defense spending by NATO members, while others believe it has damaged essential relationships and undermined NATO's credibility. Critics also lament the lack of coordination with allies on policies with significant security ramifications for Europe. Many Members of Congress support robust U.S. leadership of NATO to address potential threats posed by Russia and advocate for enhanced military responses to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Some question whether NATO should take action against allies like Turkey for policies that could threaten alliance security. Key questions for NATO's future include evaluating its strategic value to the U.S., leadership role, adoption of a new strategic concept reflecting current threats, and capacity to address security threats. NATO is facing new threats in cyber and hybrid warfare domains, as well as security challenges from the MENA region. There are concerns about member states meeting defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, and allies' contributions to deterrence efforts. Sanctions for jeopardizing security, NATO's enlargement policy, and developing a strategy towards China are also key areas of focus."
