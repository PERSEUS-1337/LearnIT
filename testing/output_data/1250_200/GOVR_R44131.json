Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. The report details the history of UCLASS requirements development and changes over time, starting with research on unmanned combat air vehicles in 1999. The Navy's UCAV project, known as N-UCAV, was designed for reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under this program. In 2003, the Navy and Air Force merged their UCAV efforts into the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program, following a directive from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program, initiated in 2003, aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. However, the program was terminated in 2006, leading to the development of the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for longer-range carrier-based operations. The Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) program was initiated in 2006 as a follow-on effort to the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. N-UCAS aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from aircraft carriers, with a focus on expanding payload options and increasing naval reach and persistence. In 2013, the Navy successfully launched and landed a UCAS-D on an aircraft carrier as part of the N-UCAS program. The UCLASS program was developed from the N-UCAS program to create an unmanned carrier-launched surveillance and strike platform. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document in 2011, defining it as a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. However, in 2012, the JROC revised the requirements for UCLASS to focus more on permissive airspace ISR capabilities, possibly due to budget constraints. The UCLASS program shifted its focus to prioritize permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy reduced the strike capability of the next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle to align with affordability directives. The JROC emphasized affordability as the top priority for the program in a December 2012 memorandum. The CDD established an affordability KPP, limiting the recurring fly-away cost of the air vehicles for one 600 nautical mile orbit to $150 million. The Navy established an affordability KPP for the UCLASS program, limiting the cost of air vehicles for one 600 nautical mile orbit to $150 million. The draft RFP emphasized affordability, timely fielding, and endurance, with goals of providing ISR orbits and light strike capability in uncontested airspace. The UCLASS program aims to provide an early operational capability for light strike missions in permissive environments, with plans for growth to operate in contested environments. The end goal is an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. However, procurement timelines are unclear, and ongoing delays have been experienced due to changes in requirements. The DOD is conducting a review of airborne surveillance systems and the future of the carrier air wing. The Navy's UCLASS schedule is delayed due to questions about required capabilities. DOD is reviewing airborne surveillance systems and the carrier air wing, leading to a 3-year delay in the air system contract award. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. Further reviews and changes in DOD priorities may cause requirements to evolve."
