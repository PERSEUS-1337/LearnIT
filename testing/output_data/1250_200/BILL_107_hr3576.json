    "content": "No information provided. Congress finds that it is in the national interest for all citizens, including active-duty service members, to be allowed to vote in Federal elections. Since 1977, active-duty service members serving overseas or on the United States mainland have been excluded from fully participating and voting in both general and runoff Federal elections in American Samoa due to various factors. American Samoa's law requiring uniformed service voters to register in person contradicts the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which has been in effect for over 15 years. Despite being aware of this discrepancy, American Samoa has not addressed it. American Samoa has not addressed the discrepancy between Federal and territorial law regarding voting rights for uniformed voters. Additional action is needed to ensure their votes are counted in Federal elections and to state that the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act supersedes American Samoa law. It is also in the national interest for Members of the United States House of Representatives to be elected in the first week of November in even-numbered years. Since 1980, there have been general elections in American Samoa without a final decision on the Congressional Delegate. Several general elections in American Samoa have not resulted in a final decision on the Congressional Delegate, leading to runoff elections. A delayed outcome may put the newly elected Delegate in a less senior position compared to other Members of Congress. Holding a primary election to reduce the number of candidates can increase the likelihood of a candidate winning with a majority of votes. SEC. 2. PRIMARY ELECTION REQUIRED. Section 2(a) of the Act is amended to include provisions for a primary election in general election years with 3 or more candidates for the office of Delegate. If no candidate receives over 50% of the votes in the primary election, the top 2 candidates will proceed to the general election. Candidates receiving the most votes will be listed on the ballot for the general election year. Candidates for Delegate to the United States House of Representatives must file their candidacy by the first Tuesday of July in election years. The Act requires candidates for Delegate to the United States House of Representatives to file their candidacy by the first Tuesday of July in election years. Section 4 of the Act is amended to specify that ties between candidates will be resolved in a general Federal election. The amendments will be effective on January 1, 2003."
