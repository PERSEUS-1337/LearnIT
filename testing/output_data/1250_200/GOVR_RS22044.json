Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, differences in interpretation of the IDEA and the \"equitable participation\" standard among states and courts led to varying levels of services for children with disabilities in private schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard and required provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools, funded proportionately by federal funds. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 required provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools, funded proportionately by federal funds.

Children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents are entitled to special education and related services, with the requirement that they be located in the school district served by the LEA. This provision aims to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools in multiple jurisdictions, although it has sparked controversy. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies regarding children with disabilities in private schools. It includes provisions for funding and services for parentally placed private school children, emphasizing direct services over indirect services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified responsibilities for private school children with disabilities.

The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA outlines procedures for private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA regarding consultation processes and provision of equitable services by public agencies. Private school officials can escalate complaints to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the SEA's determination. Services provided to private school pupils must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, with funds controlled and administered by a public agency. The cost of private school placement for children with disabilities is not paid by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. The new law specifies conditions under which reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied, including situations where the school prevented the parent from providing notice or compliance would likely result in physical harm to the child. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate or cannot write in English, at the discretion of a court or hearing officer. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
