    "content": "The Act titled \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" defines key terms like \"Administrator\" and \"municipality.\" It introduces the concept of Integrated Plans for water pollution control, outlining the framework for municipalities to develop such plans in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency. The Water Infrastructure Improvement Act allows municipalities to develop integrated plans for water pollution control, which can be included in permits. These integrated plans can address various requirements such as sewer overflows, sewer system management, stormwater discharge, wastewater discharge, and water quality limitations. Additionally, the plans may involve projects for water reclamation and recycling. The Water Infrastructure Improvement Act permits municipalities to implement projects for water reclamation, recycling, and green infrastructure. Compliance schedules may span multiple permit terms if authorized by state standards and meet regulatory requirements. Compliance with water quality-based effluent limitations can be phased over time without violating statutory deadlines. The Act allows for the implementation of water quality-based effluent limitations over multiple permit terms. Compliance schedules in permits can be reviewed and modified during renewal. Existing obligations to comply with technology and water quality standards are retained, and states have flexibility to revise water quality standards with approval. State authority under section 301(b)(1)(C) is clarified. The Act clarifies state authority to authorize compliance schedules in water quality standards for effluent limitations. It also prohibits revising less stringent compliance schedules in judicial orders or consent decrees unless modified by agreement. Additionally, the implementation of integrated plans through enforcement tools is addressed in Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow municipalities to develop integrated plans in conjunction with enforcement actions related to municipal discharges. Municipalities with integrated plans consistent with section 402(s) can request modifications to administrative orders or settlement agreements. The Administrator is required to report to Congress on integrated plans developed and implemented within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Municipal Ombudsman office is established within the EPA to provide technical assistance to municipalities for compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and to ensure agency policies are implemented. The Ombudsman will work with municipalities on integrated plans developed through permits or orders, including control measures, costs, and compliance schedules. The Municipal Ombudsman office within the EPA collaborates with headquarters and regional offices to provide municipalities with information on federal financial assistance, flexibility under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the opportunity to develop integrated plans. The Ombudsman also shares general information on technical and financial assistance, flexibility, and resources related to integrated plans on the EPA website. The EPA collaborates with municipalities to provide information on federal financial assistance, flexibility under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the opportunity to develop integrated plans. The agency also promotes green infrastructure measures to reduce stormwater flows to sewer systems or surface waters. The Administrator of the EPA is tasked with promoting and integrating green infrastructure into permitting, enforcement, planning, research, and funding guidance. Efforts to increase green infrastructure use will be coordinated with federal agencies, state, tribal, and local governments, and the private sector. Regional EPA offices will promote green infrastructure through outreach, training, and integration within their respective regions. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting green infrastructure implementation and information-sharing. This includes outreach, training, and incorporating green infrastructure into regulatory programs and codes. The goal is to reduce water pollution, protect water resources, comply with regulations, and achieve environmental and public health goals.
