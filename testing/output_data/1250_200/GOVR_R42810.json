    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and exposures. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) to provide special authority for the VA to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure. In 1993, P.L. 103-210 granted additional authority for the VA to care for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions possibly linked to toxic substances or environmental hazards during their service. The Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 and P.L. 103-210 granted VA authority to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange, ionizing radiation, and toxic substances or environmental hazards during their service. P.L. 112-154 addresses chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, providing VA health care services eligibility for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987 due to contaminated water, allowing medical care for specific illnesses. The VA provides care for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange, ionizing radiation, and toxic substances. They also address chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune. The VA covers costs for eligible family members and partners with states for nursing home care facilities. State laws govern admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes. The VA pays full care costs for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more. The VA now pays the full cost of nursing home care for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability regardless of the care setting, thanks to the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. This act also allows for higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes caring for these veterans, with restrictions on funding from other federal sources like Medicare or Medicaid. The VA implemented a new reimbursement methodology for state veterans' nursing homes, leading to smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. Section 105 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to contract with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with a service-connected condition or a disability rating of 70% or greater. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with SVHs. Additionally, the VA is required to replicate the previous reimbursement methodology at the request of any SVH. In June 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported about 300 sexual assault incidents to the VA police, including various types of assault incidents. Many of these incidents were not reported to the VA. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported numerous sexual assault incidents to the VA police, including forced or inappropriate oral sex. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to the lack of a centralized reporting system. Section 106 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at VA medical facilities. This provision also requires the VA to consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a significant issue for veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to increased blast injuries from explosive devices. Advances in medical care have reduced fatalities from these injuries, leading to more accurate TBI diagnoses. The exact number of veterans with TBI is unknown, partly due to difficulties in identification and access to VA healthcare services. Current law mandates comprehensive care for veterans with TBI, but concerns have been raised about the VA's implementation of this policy. The VA is required to provide comprehensive care to veterans with TBI, including rehabilitative services to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning. Telemedicine and telehealth are utilized for medical purposes when distance or time separates participants. Telehealth, a broader concept than telemedicine, involves using electronic information and telecommunications technologies for long-distance clinical health care, patient education, and health administration. Telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided through communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatry. It allows clinicians to deliver mental health care to patients remotely. The Department of Defense (DOD) and VA utilize telehealth, specifically telebehavioral health, to provide mental health care to patients remotely. Telehealth has been used since 1977 and is recognized as a cost-effective method for delivering care to veterans in rural areas. VA facilities are required to offer teleconsultation programs for mental health assessments and provide training in telemedicine to medical residents. The VA provides training in telemedicine to medical residents and offers various outpatient services without copayments for veterans in the health care system. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any treatment. Veterans without service-connected conditions or illnesses are required to pay copayments for primary and specialty care visits. Veterans receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions are required to pay copayments for primary and specialty care visits. The VA can waive copayments for telehealth consultations. Service dogs are provided to veterans with hearing, mobility, and mental health issues. Research is being conducted on the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities. The VA conducted a three-year research study on using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. Section 109 of P.L. 112-154 allows accredited service dogs access to VA facilities. The Office of Rural Health (ORH) was established in 2006 to address disparities in service for rural veterans. The VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in different locations across the country. The VA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to address disparities in service for rural veterans. The ORH oversees Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in various locations, including Togus, ME, White River Junction, VT, Gainesville, FL, Iowa City, IA, and Salt Lake City, UT. These centers experiment with new outreach and care models to improve healthcare delivery for veterans in rural areas. P.L. 112-154 mandates that VRHRCs perform functions such as identifying disparities in healthcare availability and developing special practices for rural veterans. Additionally, the VHA has the authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover medical costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) granted the VA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to defray medical costs. It allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the Medical Care Collections Fund for providing medical services without fiscal year limitations. The change from billing based on \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" aimed to increase collections. The Administration's budget in FY2004 requested the consolidation of medical collections accounts into one MCCF, including funds from various accounts like the Health Services Improvement Fund and the Veterans Extended Care Revolving Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 provided the VA with permanent authority to deposit funds from these accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. Section 111 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to develop a plan to collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF. The VA is required to develop a plan to collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective processes, policies, training, revenue goals, and monitoring systems. Additionally, a three-year initiative is underway to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The VA Secretary is required to issue a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the beneficiaries of the initiative and an analysis of the initiative. Currently, VA provides eligible veterans and other beneficiaries mileage reimbursement, special mode transport when medically indicated, and common carrier transport when traveling to and from VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization from the VA is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. VA proposed legislative language to use local prevailing Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to address paying higher rates than allowed by Medicare. In its FY2012 budget submission, VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services. However, a technical correction was made to authorize VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate. The VA is authorized to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. This new reimbursement method applies to all ambulance transportation except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. Means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions is established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for VA health care. P.L. 112-154 allows VA to use the veteran's household income from the most recent year for eligibility determination. P.L. 112-154 makes changes to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program, providing grants for veterans with certain disabilities to purchase or remodel homes. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for mobility impairments and one for blindness or loss of hand use. The dollar limit for mobility grants is higher, and both types are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for grants. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for grants under the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program, including veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion. Section 203 changes the measure of blindness for grants. Section 204 increases the maximum amount of assistance for grants. The new law (P.L. 112-154) increases the statutory grant limits for Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grants to $63,780 and for Special Home Adaptation (SHA) grants to $12,756. These limits are adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index. The law also allows veterans to use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily, with increased maximum grant amounts. The TRA grants are now subject to annual adjustment using the same cost-of-construction index as veteran's or servicemember's own home grants. The authority for TRA grants has been extended from December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2022. An exception to grant limits allows funds for acquiring another suitable home if a previously-adapted home is substantially damaged in a disaster. The VA Loan Guaranty Program is a mortgage insurance program for eligible veterans. Veterans pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service. The program guarantees a portion of the loan for lenders in case of borrower default. Eligible properties must be occupied by the veteran. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities or certain surviving spouses. Section 206 of P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. The disability must meet specific duration requirements. Surviving spouses who qualify under this provision are exempt from paying the guaranteed loan fee. Section 207 of P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to satisfy the occupancy requirement. Sections 208 and 209 make permanent the programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages. Section 210 modifies the law on waiving loan guaranty fees for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The new law under P.L. 112-154 allows disability compensation eligibility based on pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence. Section 702 of the law addresses loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and loan sales securities. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. The VA's maximum guaranty amount for loans was increased through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154, allowing for guarantees up to 175% of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas until December 31, 2014. Additionally, the VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans was extended. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans, which are direct loans entered into after veteran default on a mortgage, was extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to this extension, the VA used the Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for various purposes, including providing housing for homeless veterans and other non-housing related purposes. The EUL program was changed to only allow properties to be used for \"supportive housing\" for veterans or their families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Different types of housing qualify, such as transitional, permanent, and single room occupancy housing. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws. The VA may only receive \"cash at fair value\" for consideration, not in-kind payment. An annual report on consideration received for EULs is required. The VA releases an annual report on consideration received for EULs, as required by law. The Grant and Per Diem program provides grants for transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. Grantees are reimbursed for costs, not exceeding the current per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Section 301 of P.L. 112-154 allows grants for construction of service centers and transitional housing. The VA Grant and Per Diem program allows grants for construction of service centers and transitional housing, with the option to use Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Grantees can receive funds from other sources if operated by a private nonprofit organization. The program is authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targeting homeless veterans with special needs. The Grant and Per Diem program targets homeless veterans with special needs, including women, women with children, the frail elderly, veterans with terminal illnesses, and those with chronic mental illnesses. Changes in legislation have expanded eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children and eliminated certain requirements for grantees. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, medical care, psychiatric treatment, and referrals for homeless veterans, with recent amendments allowing all homeless veterans to participate. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program aimed at assisting homeless veterans. The HCHV program, HUD-VASH, is a collaborative effort between the VA and HUD to provide housing vouchers for homeless veterans. The VA may enter contracts with other entities to help veterans find suitable housing and connect them with services. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) are two programs that serve homeless veterans. HVRP helps veterans find employment and is authorized for $50 million per year. SSVF assists low-income veterans and their families with housing transitions, authorized for $300 million in FY2013. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational assistance to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational assistance to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers. DEA participants are entitled to 45 months of benefits, with the option to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 offers educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans, while the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program primarily serves eligible members of the Armed Forces who entered active duty after June 30, 1985. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 requires annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA, starting from November 13, 2013, to January 1, 2021. The Defense report must cover recruitment and retention effects, cost coverage, active duty eligibility, and recommendations. The VA report must include program usage, expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations. This section also repeals the biennial reporting requirement for the MGIB-AD. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 repeals the biennial reporting requirement for the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing decisions on benefits can now submit additional evidence without the need for initial review by the local VA office, speeding up the appeals process. This change will go into effect 180 days after the law's enactment. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants. Section 505 permits the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement in certain cases. The VA can award the maximum benefit allowed by law and may publish regulations to encourage claimants to submit relevant private medical records. Section 507 of P.L. 112-154 states that if a veteran receiving compensation or pension dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for that month. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims, including how the VA can assist in gathering the required information. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to print the VCAA notice on claims forms, send notifications by efficient means, and waive notification requirements when evidence supports granting the claim. The VA can waive VCAA notification requirements when granting the highest evaluation to veterans. The Fully Developed Claim process expedites disability claims, allowing for an effective date up to one year before the claim application is received. This option is available for original FDC disability claims for three years. The effective date for original FDC disability claims can be up to one year before the claim application is received. The VA Secretary and Social Security Commissioner must use joint application forms for survivor benefits. The Improved Disability Pension program provides a monthly cash benefit to low-income elderly or totally disabled veterans with active military service during a period of war. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases benefits. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit under the Improved Disability Pension program for married couples who are both veterans and require regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse will reduce the maximum cash benefit amount. Reimbursements for casualty losses, equipment, vehicles, items, money, or property are excluded from income calculations for benefit purposes. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands this exclusion to include reimbursements for expenses related to accidents, theft, or loss. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may be eligible for financial assistance from the VA to purchase an automobile or adaptive equipment. The VA provides financial assistance to disabled veterans and servicemembers for the purchase of automobiles or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows for assistance in purchasing a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a disaster. The VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program offers employment services for veterans with disabilities, and in cases where employment is not possible, it provides independent living services. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends the subsistence allowance for veterans in the VR&E program affected by disasters, allowing for an additional two months of support. It also waives the annual participation limit for IL services for veterans displaced by disasters. Additionally, the law increases restrictions on public demonstrations at veterans' funerals. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations during funerals of servicemembers and veterans. Demonstrations are now restricted 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with increased minimum distance requirements. Violations can result in statutory damages ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 codifies regulations prohibiting the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President able to waive this prohibition. The President can waive the prohibition on reserving gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments to honor missing servicemembers. Monuments in memory of individuals or military events can be established 25 years after their service, with the option to waive this requirement. Non-governmental entities can sponsor monuments in the cemetery. Section 604 outlines the process for establishing a monument in Arlington National Cemetery, requiring a study of other locations, consultation with relevant committees, and congressional notification. The VA provides certificates to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Military personnel who die during active service are not eligible for the certificate. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate to persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meet financial obligations incurred before entry into active military service. The SCRA includes provisions that prohibit eviction, cap interest rates, and protect insurance policies for servicemembers called up for active duty. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers to prevent cancellation of insurance policies, suspend malpractice insurance, and avoid taxation issues while on active duty. The SCRA has been amended multiple times since 2003, with recent changes extending mortgage and foreclosure protections until December 31, 2014. Specifically, Section 710 of P.L. 112-154 addresses mortgages and trust deeds for servicemembers unable to make payments due to military service, preventing vendors from taking action against them. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers, including prohibiting sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property during military service and for one year after without a court order. Section 701 requires a report to Congress on SCRA protections, while Section 703 mandates a plan to evaluate and train VA employees processing disability claims. The VA is responsible for processing disability compensation and pension benefit claims, providing training for employees with unsatisfactory skills, and taking appropriate personnel actions if skills remain unsatisfactory.

Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 grants the VA authority to debar firms that misrepresent their status as veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Debarments are imposed for punishment and are now clarified to be only for willful and intentional misrepresentation, with a minimum debarment period of five years. Time frames for debarment actions and treatment of principals of debarred firms are also established. Section 706 of the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 outlines time frames for debarment actions and treatment of principals of debarred firms. It requires the VA to start a debarment action within 30 days of determining willful misrepresentation and complete it within 90 days. Debarment includes all principals of the firm for at least five years. Additionally, Section 707 mandates the VA Secretary to report on conferences costing $20,000 or more with 50 or more attendees. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually to the Department of Labor. Every federal contractor and subcontractor with a contract value of $100,000 or more must report annually to the Department of Labor (DOL) on total employment, new employees, and the number of qualified veterans. P.L. 112-154 requires the DOL Secretary to establish a website for public disclosure of this information. P.L. 112-154 also directs the VA Secretary to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
