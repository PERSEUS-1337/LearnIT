    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is a key tool for advancing U.S. interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of countries in the region. While some countries still require assistance for political and security challenges, others have outgrown aid but receive support for new challenges like citizen security and combating organized crime. Despite progress in the region, foreign aid remains important for advancing U.S. policy goals. Congress oversees and funds these aid programs, even as efforts to reduce budget deficits continue. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on historical and recent trends in aid to the region. It also examines the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for State Department and USAID-related assistance, as well as support from other U.S. agencies. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to spending cuts in aid programs, prompting closer scrutiny on the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. aid. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has a long history, with significant increases in the 1960s and 1970s due to political events in the region. Aid declined in the 1990s but has since continued, with a focus on supporting democratic processes and development. In the late 1990s, U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased, with a focus on humanitarian and development aid. This was further boosted by initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The Obama Administration emphasized economic growth in the region and provided significant aid to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The increase in U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean post-2010 earthquake in Haiti was mainly directed towards counternarcotics and security programs, including initiatives like Plan Colombia, the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in aid from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. This decline in aid is part of a broader trend of shifting priorities in U.S. foreign policy towards development efforts in Africa and other regions. The United States has shifted resources towards development efforts in Africa and strategic anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012. This assistance serves various purposes, with a focus on development and humanitarian programs aimed at promoting economic progress, social stability, democracy, education, health, and environmental protection in the region. The United States provides assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean for economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian aid focuses on immediate relief for emergencies, including food assistance and support for refugees. USAID manages most programs, while the State Department administers accounts for global health and manages the Economic Support Fund for promoting U.S. interests in the region. The United States provides security assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean through various accounts managed by USAID and the State Department. This includes funding for counternarcotics efforts, civilian law enforcement, strengthening judicial institutions, and countering global threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation. Assistance also includes support for Latin American and Caribbean militaries through equipment provision and personnel training. Total aid levels to the region have declined. In recent years, total aid levels to Latin America and the Caribbean have declined. The balance of remaining assistance has shifted towards development and humanitarian aid, away from security assistance. In FY2012, over $730 million in U.S. aid was provided for development and humanitarian programs, representing nearly 39% of total bilateral assistance to the region. Another $466 million was provided for U.S. strategic interests. Additionally, nearly $700 million was provided for security efforts, representing approximately 37% of total bilateral assistance, down from 41% in FY2008. The United States has provided significant aid to Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico in recent years. Aid to Haiti has focused on development challenges, especially after the 2010 earthquake. Colombia has received aid through \"Plan Colombia,\" with a shift towards economic and social development as the security situation improves. The United States has shifted its assistance focus from costly military equipment to economic and social development efforts in Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico. Aid levels have decreased as the emphasis moved towards rule of law programs. In FY2012, $357 million was provided for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would result in a 10% decrease in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean compared to FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would lead to a 10% decrease in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean compared to FY2012. The proposed cuts are widespread, with funding for every account except Development Assistance decreasing. Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana would see significant cuts, while Colombia and Mexico would experience the largest declines in assistance. El Salvador is the only country in the region to receive a substantial increase in aid, reflecting a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes over $698 million in assistance, representing a 4% decrease from FY2012. Security assistance would receive $567 million, a 19% decrease from FY2012. Mexico and Central America would receive 36% of the total aid request. Central America and the Caribbean are key focus areas for U.S. aid due to security concerns. The Andean nations of South America also receive a significant portion of aid. Over the years, the U.S. has provided substantial economic assistance to Mexico and Central America, with a smaller portion allocated to military aid. El Salvador received the highest percentage of assistance, followed by Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. U.S. assistance to Central America declined over the years, with El Salvador receiving the highest percentage of aid. Assistance was a major priority during the 1980s to combat Soviet influence and support allied governments. Aid decreased considerably in the 1990s and continued to decline in the following decades, totaling about $5.9 billion between FY2000 and FY2009. U.S. aid to Central America and Mexico declined between FY2000 and FY2009 to $5.9 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars. Despite the decrease, new aid initiatives benefited countries in the sub-region. In FY2010, Mexico and Central America received almost $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance, with 57% going to Mexico. In FY2011 and FY2012, the region received $532.4 million and $696.2 million, respectively. The FY2013 request is $619.8 million, with Mexico receiving $269.5 million. In FY2013, Mexico would receive $269.5 million in U.S. assistance, a decrease of $60.6 million compared to FY2012. This is due to a shift in the M\u00e9rida Initiative towards providing training and capacity building programs instead of expensive security equipment. The assistance aims to strengthen Mexico's law enforcement entities, combat transnational criminal organizations, and support justice sector reform efforts. Support for the Mexican military includes human rights training and intelligence improvement. In FY2013, Mexico would receive $269.5 million in U.S. assistance, a decrease of $60.6 million compared to FY2012. The assistance aims to strengthen Mexico's law enforcement entities, combat transnational criminal organizations, and support justice sector reform efforts. Support for the Mexican military includes human rights training and intelligence improvement. Additionally, aid would support partnerships with Mexican universities, institutional reforms, private sector competitiveness, and climate change mitigation efforts. Congress has required withholding 15% of assistance until certain human rights conditions are met. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador face challenges in combating organized crime, with security assistance provided through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). Guatemala would receive about $93.6 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request. Guatemala would receive $93.6 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request, with the majority allocated to Development Assistance for various projects. This includes initiatives to improve trade capacity, environmental conservation, education, combat trafficking, and promote good governance. Aid for food security and healthcare makes up 36% of the request, while 4% is for training and equipment for security forces. U.S. assistance also supports the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The FY2013 request includes $58.2 million in U.S. assistance for Honduras, with the majority allocated to decentralize governance, improve service delivery, ensure transparency in elections, enhance education, and implement a food security strategy. Health assistance would support HIV/AIDS strategy and health system reform. Security forces would receive training and equipment to improve civil-military relations. El Salvador would receive $41.8 million in U.S. assistance, with a focus on economic growth initiatives. El Salvador is part of the Obama Administration's Partnership for Growth initiative to promote economic growth. Constraints on growth include crime, insecurity, and lack of competitiveness. U.S. assistance in FY2013 would support security and justice reforms, anti-corruption efforts, education, public administration, and private sector competitiveness. Assistance would also strengthen Salvadoran security forces. U.S. aid to Nicaragua would decrease by $390,000 under the FY2013 request, mainly directed towards democracy promotion projects and market-oriented economic policies. Some assistance would also be provided to the Nicaraguan military for counternarcotics efforts. Relations with President Daniel Ortega have led to a decline in aid in recent years. The USAID Missions in Belize and Costa Rica closed in 1996, and the Mission in Panama is expected to close in September 2012. Despite this, these countries still receive U.S. assistance, with a $6.4 million increase in the FY2013 request. The assistance includes equipment and training for security forces to combat drug trafficking and other security threats. Additionally, there is $29.7 million allocated for USAID's Central America Regional program, with a focus on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, as well as trade capacity building efforts. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) receives funding through the regional program to support U.S. and Central American security objectives, improve narcotics interdiction, and disrupt criminal networks. CARSI also provides support for Central American law enforcement and justice sector institutions. CARSI supports Central American law enforcement and justice sector institutions, addressing deficiencies and enhancing capacities for citizen safety. It also aids in drug demand reduction and provides opportunities for at-risk youth. Funding is provided through the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program, with assistance given bilaterally to Central American nations and for regional projects. The State Department has not disclosed a breakdown of CARSI funding by country. In the 1980s, U.S. aid to the Caribbean totaled about $5.5 billion in 2010 dollars, with the majority going to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. Aid included economic and military assistance, with a significant program for Eastern Caribbean countries post the 1983 U.S.-led military intervention in Grenada.

Aid included economic and military assistance, with a significant program for Eastern Caribbean countries post the 1983 U.S.-led military intervention in Grenada. U.S. assistance to the Caribbean increased significantly in FY2010 to almost $1.7 billion, largely due to Haiti's devastating earthquake. A new Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was also initiated in FY2010 to support efforts to reduce illicit trafficking and promote social justice. U.S. assistance to the Caribbean amounted to $572 million in FY2011 and an estimated $522 million in FY2012, with a decline to almost $492 million in the Administration's FY2013 request. The Administration's FY2013 request for U.S. assistance to the Caribbean is almost $492 million, a 5.9% decline from the previous year. Haiti continues to receive the majority of funding, with over two-thirds of assistance allocated for reconstruction efforts. The focus of U.S. assistance to Haiti includes infrastructure, food security, health services, and governance. Thomas C. Adams oversees the management of the assistance program for Haiti. The U.S. assistance program for Haiti is managed by Thomas C. Adams and focuses on infrastructure, food security, health services, and governance. Over 1.5 million Haitians were initially in tent camps after the earthquake, with 36% still displaced as of early 2012. Efforts have also been made to address a cholera outbreak that began in 2010. The goal of U.S. assistance is to stimulate economic growth and create opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. The FY2013 foreign aid request includes bilateral programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program in Barbados would assist countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and St. Lucia, with a focus on HIV/AIDS programs. The USAID Mission in Barbados will manage HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Dominican Republic, global health activities focused on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health will be supported. For Cuba, $15 million is requested for humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families. In FY2013, the US allocated $7 million for assistance in Guyana, reflecting a decrease due to improved HIV/AIDS efforts.

In the 1990s, aid increased to almost $6 billion, with Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador being the main recipients. From FY2000 to FY2009, aid more than doubled to about $14.3 billion, with Colombia receiving the majority of assistance for initiatives like Plan Colombia. The United States supported Plan Colombia with a focus on drug eradication, alternative development, and support for the Colombian military in its struggle against guerrillas and paramilitaries. Peru and Bolivia also received significant aid, with Colombia accounting for almost 70% of the aid in FY2010. Aid to the Andean region in FY2011 and FY2012 amounted to $621 million and $516 million respectively, with Colombia receiving 73% of the aid. The FY2013 request is for $452 million, with Colombia accounting for the majority of the decline in assistance.

Additionally, assistance from the INCLE account will support drug eradication, anti-money laundering efforts, judicial system strengthening, and reducing drug use. The $22.2 million FY2013 request for Bolivia continues the decreasing trend of U.S. assistance due to deteriorating U.S.-Bolivian relations since 2008. The FY2013 request for Bolivia includes funding for health sector activities, strengthening local government management capabilities, protecting biodiversity, promoting sustainable use of natural resources, and providing limited support for counternarcotics efforts. For Ecuador, the majority of the $21.3 million request would fund alternative development programs and support local governments. For Ecuador, the $21.3 million FY2013 request would fund alternative development programs, local governments, citizen participation in democratic processes, economic development, and biodiversity conservation. Aid from the INCLE account would support counternarcotics operations. In Venezuela, the US has provided limited democracy aid due to the country's oil wealth. The FY2013 request is for $3 million in democracy assistance. The FY2013 request for democracy assistance is $3 million, implemented by USAID to promote participation in the democratic process in Brazil and the Southern Cone countries.

However, the FY2013 request for the sub-region is $14.4 million, a 40% decrease from the previous year. Brazil accounted for over 70% of the combined appropriations for the sub-region in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2013 request for Brazil would see a $11 million decrease in assistance, but it would still account for 43% of the sub-region total. The assistance is transitioning from supporting development programs to promoting development in third countries, with a focus on agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in priority countries. About 21% of the FY2013 request would support HIV/AIDS programs in Brazil. The FY2013 request for Brazil focuses on supporting HIV/AIDS programs and counternarcotics efforts. In Paraguay, assistance aims to improve justice sector transparency, civil service oversight, and small farmers' productivity. Security efforts in Paraguay would receive support through training and equipment for the military and counternarcotics unit.

DOD also helps partner countries prepare for and respond to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, DOD quickly deployed military personnel to provide humanitarian assistance, including restoring air traffic control, delivering supplies, and ensuring security. DOD's capabilities allow it to respond rapidly to humanitarian crises, even though USAID is the lead authority for disaster response. Additionally, DOD provides counterdrug support to Latin American and Caribbean nations. The State Department is responsible for coordinating U.S. counterdrug assistance, while DOD has independent counterdrug authorities. DOD is authorized to support foreign counterdrug efforts through various means, providing significant assistance to countries like Colombia and Mexico. In recent years, some countries have also received DOD assistance for counterterrorism and stabilization. Between FY2006 and FY2010, DOD provided $72.1 million in counterterrorism assistance to 10 countries in the region under Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA.

The Administration's FY2013 request for the Inter-American Foundation is $18.1 million, a 20% decrease from FY2012. Despite the funding cuts, the agency plans to maintain its program level by partnering with other U.S. government agencies and the private sector. The IAF also receives additional funding from the Social Progress Trust Fund, which will decrease in future years as loans are repaid. The IAF expects a significant decrease in SPTF funds in the coming years, with funding dropping to $3 million in FY2017 and potentially to $0.5 million or less by FY2019. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to provide economic assistance to developing nations based on certain indicators. MCC awards compacts and smaller threshold programs to countries, with a focus on measurable impact and addressing areas of weak performance. Several Latin American and Caribbean countries have been awarded compacts or threshold programs by the MCC. Three Latin American and Caribbean countries - El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua - have received MCC compacts, while Guyana, Paraguay, and Peru have been awarded threshold programs. They have collectively received $886.7 million in assistance, accounting for nearly 9.5% of MCC funding worldwide. El Salvador's $461 million compact focused on developing the northern border region, addressing poverty through infrastructure improvements, education, and small business support. Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact in June 2005. In June 2005, Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact with MCC, which included projects for rural development and transportation. Despite being terminated $10 million in funding in 2009 due to political issues, the compact was completed in 2010. However, MCC decided not to renew the compact in 2011 due to corruption concerns. Honduras remains eligible for a threshold program of up to $20 million. Nicaragua also signed a $175 million compact in July 2005, focusing on economic growth in the western region. The compact with the MCC in July 2005 focused on the western region of Nicaragua for economic growth. It included projects for transportation, rural development, and property regularization.

Additionally, Guyana and Paraguay signed threshold programs with MCC in 2007 and 2006, respectively, to improve fiscal policies. Paraguay signed a two-year, $34.6 million program in May 2006 to reduce corruption, impunity, and economic informality. In April 2009, MCC awarded Paraguay $30.3 million for a second two-year program focusing on reducing corruption in various sectors. Peru signed a $35.6 million threshold program in April 2009 to increase immunization rates and combat corruption. The Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers serving in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961, with about 2,600 volunteers assigned to 22 countries in FY2011. Program funding for the region was around $65 million in FY2011 and $61 million in FY2012, with a budget request of $60 million for FY2013. Program funding for Latin America and the Caribbean was almost $65 million in FY2011 and an estimated $61 million in FY2012. The FY2013 budget request allocates about $60 million for programs in the region. Due to agency budget cuts, the number of Peace Corps volunteers is expected to decrease to 2,250 by the end of FY2012 and 1,800 by the end of FY2013. Most countries in the region will see reductions in volunteers, except for Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to their classification as upper-middle-income countries. Security concerns have led to the suspension of operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries in the past. The Peace Corps has suspended operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries due to security concerns. This includes withdrawing volunteers from Haiti in 2005, Bolivia in 2008, and Honduras in 2012. Volunteer programs in El Salvador and Guatemala were also affected, with training classes cancelled in 2011. Despite these suspensions, the Peace Corps plans to send new volunteers to El Salvador and Guatemala in 2013. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2013 prioritizes promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean make up 45% of the almost $1.7 billion request, focusing on strengthening institutions to address crime and ensure public security. Additionally, Haiti receives 20% of aid to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. The FY2013 budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes aid distribution across different program areas. \"Peace and Security\" assistance makes up 30% of aid, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" accounts for 24%, \"Investing in People\" receives 23%, and \"Economic Growth\" gets 20%. These programs support various initiatives such as counternarcotics, rule of law, health, education, and economic development. The FY2013 budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes aid distribution across different program areas, with a focus on peace and security, governing justly and democratically, investing in people, and economic growth. The Administration's request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012, taking advantage of favorable development trends in the region. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made or gaps are filled by other partners. Some Members have expressed concerns about the proposed 10% decrease in funding for the region. Some Members have concerns about the Administration's proposed 10% decrease in funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. There is agreement on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. However, some Members oppose parts of the Administration's FY2013 funding, such as the Global Climate Change Initiative and increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is a point of consensus, with calls for monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability. Some committee members opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, while others expressed opposition to increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations measure, potentially leading to significant reductions in foreign aid funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. More information on legislative priorities will be revealed as the process continues. The FY2013 foreign aid appropriations request for Latin America and the Caribbean is under scrutiny by Congress. Key questions include whether the request aligns with U.S. interests, the effectiveness of aid programs, and the potential impact of proposed aid cuts. Congress is urged to consider resource coordination to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Congress may consider resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Currently, U.S. foreign assistance is fragmented among various agencies, leading to potential overlap. Better coordination could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of aid programs. According to the OECD, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in development assistance in 2010. The United States provided $2.7 billion, other bilateral donors provided $5.1 billion, and multilateral organizations provided $2.8 billion. Studies show a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts, focus on specific countries or sectors, and use funds more efficiently. However, it is unclear who would lead such coordination efforts. The United States has begun working with successful countries in the region to provide assistance to third countries through trilateral cooperation agreements. This aims to access new solutions and expertise, combining best practices with larger financial resources. The Administration requested assistance for Brazil in FY2013 to strengthen their development agency and implement jointly funded programs. The Administration requested assistance for Brazil in FY2013 to strengthen their development agency and implement jointly funded programs in third countries. Additionally, the House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends supporting Colombian government efforts to provide training and technical assistance for counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments, as it could lead to misuse of U.S. funds. Members of Congress may consider agencies' comparative advantages in providing assistance and the potential benefits and drawbacks of supporting emerging donors. Members of Congress may consider agencies' comparative advantages in providing foreign assistance, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies, promoting inter-agency coordination, assessing program sustainability in Latin America and the Caribbean, and ensuring funds are used in accordance with U.S. law. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes the need to monitor host nations' political will for necessary reforms. The United States should assess host nations' political will to implement reforms for effective use of U.S. assistance. Latin American and Caribbean nations vary in demonstrating political will and program sustainability. Colombia has shown political will by undertaking reforms and raising revenue, allowing for a managed transition of U.S. assistance. USAID is closing missions in Panama and ending family planning programs in other countries due to partner nations' increased capacity. The United States is closing its mission in Panama and ending voluntary family planning programs in several Latin American countries due to partner nations' increased capacity to manage and fund the programs. However, reports have shown a lack of political will in the region to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support, leading to challenges in program sustainability. A study in Honduras found that roads built for small farmers may have limited lifespan due to lack of maintenance capacity. Questions for Congress include host country's ability to maintain equipment, financial responsibility, and political will for reforms. FY2013 appropriations bills for foreign aid were marked up in May 2012. In May 2012, appropriations committees in Congress marked up FY2013 bills for the Department of State and Foreign Operations. The House bill (H.R. 5857) totaled $48.3 billion, while the Senate bill (S. 3241) totaled $52.3 billion. Funding levels in FY2013 would have been lower than FY2012 estimates and the Obama Administration's request. The House bill was criticized by the Obama Administration for exceeding agreed-upon cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The House bill for FY2013 foreign operations funding was criticized by the Obama Administration for exceeding agreed-upon cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill's funding levels were deemed \"unworkable\" and could potentially damage national security in Latin America and the Caribbean. Specific allocations for individual countries were not specified, but the House report expressed intentions to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request for some nations in the region. The Committee recommends restoring reductions proposed in the request for key countries in Latin America to support counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, rule of law activities, and judicial reform to combat drug trafficking and crime. Additional resources are directed to strengthen democratic institutions, professional police forces, and address poverty in the region. The Senate report also highlights challenges in Central and South America due to struggling economies and weak governmental institutions. The committee recommends additional funds for key countries in Latin America to support counternarcotics, law enforcement, rule of law activities, and judicial reform. Specific funding levels are stipulated for Colombia and Mexico, with both reports calling for assistance above the requested levels. For Colombia, the House report recommends increased funding for training and technical assistance, while the Senate report emphasizes alternative development and institution building. For Mexico, the House report suggests increased funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border. The Senate and House reports differed on funding priorities for Latin America. The House recommended additional funding for democracy programs in Venezuela and Cuba, while the Senate supported the Administration's requests. The House also recommended increased funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border, while the Senate supported the requested levels for regional security programs. The House bill proposed additional funding for democracy programs in Cuba, while the Senate bill capped funding at the requested level. The Senate recommended more funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon, but the House did not mention them. Congress did not take action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, instead enacting a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) that expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) approved funding federal programs through the end of FY2013, maintaining State Department and Foreign Operations accounts at FY2012 levels with some exceptions and subject to budget sequestration cuts. Funding for State Department and Foreign Operations in FY2013 was maintained at FY2012 levels, with some exceptions, but subject to budget sequestration cuts. The reductions will be applied at the account level, resulting in about a 5% decrease in funding. Country-level allocations for FY2013 are not yet available."
