The Democratic critique of the Republicans' management of the House during the 104th to 109th Congresses focused on ethics and legislative management. Democrats made changes to ethics rules and laws when they took majority control in the 110th Congress. Incremental rules changes were made in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In the 104th Congress, Democrats proposed new gift rules and regulations on Members' copyright royalty income.

In the 105th Congress, the debate focused on the time allowed for the Ethics Committee to complete its work on ethics violations admissions by Speaker Newt Gingrich. In the 106th Congress, Democrats proposed new clauses to prevent Members from intervening in hiring or dismissal based on political affiliation and to prohibit leadership from threatening entities based on political contributions. The 107th Congress did not address ethics issues, while the 108th Congress incorporated bipartisan agreement provisions into House rules. In the 108th Congress, the Republican rules package included provisions from a bipartisan agreement on the operation of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee. However, it also made three changes to ethics rules that Democrats sought to eliminate. These changes allowed limited income from medical practice by Members who were doctors or dentists, permitted gifts of perishable food to House offices, and exempted charity travel from the gift rule under certain conditions. The Republican rules package for the 109th Congress made changes to the procedures of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee, which Democrats criticized as weakening ethical standards in the House. In response to changes in the Republican rules package, Democrats criticized the reduction of the ethics committee's power and sought to eliminate provisions such as allowing indicted Members to hold leadership positions. They also pushed to prevent ethics complaints from being dismissed after 45 days and to restrict Members from engaging in employment negotiations with individuals with legislative interests. Democratic efforts led to the reinstatement of previous ethics rules in April 2005, with ongoing proposals for changes to ethics standards throughout the 109th Congress. In June 2006, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the Democrats' \"New Direction for America,\" which included measures such as banning gifts and travel from lobbyists, imposing a two-year \"cooling-off period\" for lobbying, and requiring disclosure of contributions and client fees. Other provisions included criminal penalties for ethics violations, disclosure of outside employment negotiations, open conference committee meetings, and posting of conference reports for 24 hours before House consideration.

In the 109th Congress, Democrats proposed a transparency issue regarding a two-thirds vote on waiving the three-day layover of a measure. They also addressed legislative continuity in case of catastrophic events. A constitutional point of order was raised against provisional quorum rules, but the House proceeded with the rules resolution. In the 109th Congress, Democrats criticized Republican legislative management and proposed changes for the House, including regular consultations between party leaders, a predictable schedule, and increased Minority control over committee budgets.

The \"Broken Promises\" report criticized special rules limiting minority input in the legislative process and made recommendations to open up the process, allow more bills under open rules, and consider major legislation with fewer suspension bills. The Republican leadership should expand debate time and quantity of amendments on bills under special rules, restrict suspensions to Mondays and Tuesdays, and end the practice of granting 'blanket waivers' to conference reports. Representative Slaughter and other Democratic members introduced a resolution to restore transparency, accountability, and oversight in House rules.

Democratic control of the House in the early 21st century saw patterns of managing the House established by Democratic leaders, which Republicans critiqued and eventually responded to when they claimed the majority in the 112th Congress. In the 110th Congress, Republicans tried to amend the special rule (H.Res. 5) for consideration of the rules resolution (H.Res. 6) by proposing legislative components of the Democrats' New House Principles. They also sought to add prohibitions on special rules to protect changes made during their majority. In the 111th Congress, Republicans again tried to preserve their changes in House rules by offering a motion to commit the rules resolution (H.Res. 5). Republicans sought to preserve changes made in House rules during their majority by offering a motion to commit the rules resolution (H.Res. 5) to retain term limits on committee chairs and strike changes to the House rule concerning the motion to recommit proposed in the Democratic rules resolution. They criticized the limited opportunities for Member input, bills brought to the floor without committee consideration, limited amendments allowed under structured rules, closed rules, and procedures that obviated the opportunity to offer the motion to recommit.

The amendment aimed to limit increases in the national debt by preventing deficits from mandatory spending and tax breaks. The pay-as-you-go law signed by President Obama aims to limit increases in the national debt by eliminating provisions allowing special interest tax breaks. A motion to require Members to decide on participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program within 15 days was defeated. A motion to study the constitutionality of deleting Delegates' voting rights in House rules was tabled. Democrats responded to the Republican rules package in the 113th Congress by proposing amendments. In response to the Republican rules package in the 113th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments related to different policy stances. Democratic floor manager Louise Slaughter urged defeating the previous question motion to allow for an amendment on a joint resolution overturning the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. She highlighted the influence of unlimited money from special interests in elections. Wealthy special interests have flooded elections with secret political spending to buy airwaves and fund expensive campaigns. A Democratic amendment aims to remove unlimited political donations from the electoral system. In the 114th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments related to voting rights for Delegates.

In the 114th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments to address economic policy legislation, including the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act. The motion to commit the House rules resolution for this amendment was rejected, and the resolution was ultimately agreed to.

Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's motion to refer a resolution to a select committee was tabled. Louise Slaughter criticized the lack of regular order and called for more open debate. During the debate on the 115th Congress rules resolution (H.Res. 5), Democrats argued against rules changes allowing fines for breaching decorum with electronic devices. The changes were a response to a 25-hour sit-in by Democratic Members demanding votes on anti-gun violence legislation. Democrats claimed the changes allowed punishment without due process. The 49-person massacre in an Orlando nightclub on June 12 led to a debate on rules changes in the 115th Congress. Democratic Members argued against changes allowing fines for breaching decorum with electronic devices, claiming it lacked due process protections and abridged Members' rights to debate. Representative John Lewis motioned to strike a change from the rules resolution, which was rejected. Another change exempted legislation related to healthcare reform from a standing order. Democrats opposed a standing order exempting healthcare reform legislation from fines for breaching decorum with electronic devices. They argued that the exemption would allow repeal or reform of healthcare laws without considering the impact on the federal deficit, potentially harming Medicare recipients and affecting the solvency of Medicare. Representative Slaughter planned to offer an amendment to restrict bills affecting health benefits or taxes for wealthy individuals. The House adopted a rules resolution that included reintroducing the Holman Rule, allowing for legislation on appropriations bills to \"retrench expenditures.\" Democrats argued that this rule could lead to firing or cutting the pay of federal employees.

In Congress, the majority party plays a crucial role in passing laws by garnering support from Members of each house. Rules allow all Members to participate in the legislative process. Future rules changes are expected to be incremental, considering the party majority's size and composition. The House majority party must also consider Senate control and the effectiveness of the President and Congress. The Senate is considering a rules package, while the House majority party reflects on past party arrangements and the effectiveness of the President and Congress over the last 30 years. Presidents have faced various party compositions in Congress, leading to both successes and failures in policy initiatives. Both parties in the House have focused on party rules to open up to more voices in recent Congresses.

The Congressional Budget Act of 1974's requirement for two budget resolutions annually was impractical and time-consuming, leading to its abandonment. House rules are crucial for governance by all Members and parties."
