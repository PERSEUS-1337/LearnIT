    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, SEC. 1259, which deals with constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. SEC. 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. It states that if there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold at fair market value on the date of the constructive sale. Proper adjustments are made for any subsequent gain or loss realized, and the holding period is determined as if the position were acquired on the date of the constructive sale. An appreciated financial position refers to any position with potential gain if sold, such as stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest. The term 'position' refers to an interest like a futures contract, short sale, or option. A taxpayer is considered to have made a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position if they engage in certain transactions involving the same or similar property. The term 'constructive sale' includes transactions where a taxpayer acquires the same or similar property through short sales, contracts, or other transactions with the same effect. Exceptions exist for transactions marked to market or involving nonpublicly traded property. The term 'constructive sale' includes transactions where a taxpayer acquires the same or similar property through short sales, contracts, or other transactions with the same effect. Exceptions exist for transactions marked to market or involving nonpublicly traded property. Section 453(f) outlines exceptions for transactions closed by year-end, disregarding appreciated financial positions sold or disposed of during the taxable year. For tax purposes, a transaction is not valid if entered into within a 31-day period of closing. Related persons are defined under specific criteria to prevent avoidance of tax laws. Debt instruments are considered property for this section. Definitions include forward contracts and offsetting notional principal contracts. An offsetting notional principal contract involves paying the investment yield on a property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in its value. Special rules apply to subsequent sales of appreciated financial positions, treating them as constructive sales for tax purposes. The taxpayer's financial position is treated as entering into a transaction after a sale. Trust interests actively traded are treated as stock. Constructive sale of property is determined as if it were an actual sale. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. Securities traders can elect mark to market accounting method for dealers in securities. Securities traders engaged in active trading may elect mark to market accounting method without the Secretary's consent. This election applies to the current taxable year and all subsequent years unless revoked. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part IV of the tax code. Sec. 1259 introduces constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions, with specific effective date provisions for application to transactions occurring after certain dates. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies constructive sale treatment as if the sale occurred 30 days after the enactment of the Act. Special rules apply for decedents with appreciated financial positions, treating them as property constituting rights to receive income. The amendment allows securities traders to elect to be treated as dealers for taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. Adjustments required for changing accounting methods are spread over a 5-year period. SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON EXCEPTION FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER SECTION 351. Amends section 351(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to consider all stock and securities held by a company in determining if it is an investment company. Effective for transfers after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date."
