    "content": "The Act titled \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects millions of Americans, costing billions annually. Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication, leads to vision loss and blindness, affecting thousands each year. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%, with the potential for remote assessment to reach more diabetic patients. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy can help reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas without access to in-office eye exams, potentially reducing vision loss by 90%. Medicare coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is being added to the Social Security Act, allowing for remote assessments to reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas without access to in-office eye exams. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals diagnosed with diabetes. The assessment must meet technical standards set by the Secretary and be conducted via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. Payment is allowed regardless of the provider's location. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health care information. Interim payment will be provided until a final regulation is published, and a study on reimbursement for remote assessments is required. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on costs for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations on reimbursement adequacy under Medicare will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The effective date for the amendments is 30 days after the enactment of the Act. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements. The Act specifies that each year of a 2-year legislative session in a State shall be considered a separate regular session of the State legislature. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must agree to use the funds for designing, demonstrating, and implementing the screening program. The Secretary must solicit applications for grants within 90 days of funds becoming available. The Secretary will prioritize grant applicants with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment and serving rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. Congressional notification is required before making grants under this section. The Secretary will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program after 3 years to determine its effectiveness in early detection and prevention of diabetic retinopathy. The advisory committee will also assess if the program can be a model for screening complications related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other chronic conditions. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 42 months of the first grant under this section, containing the advisory committee's evaluation. Definitions include 'advisory committee', 'eligible entity' (such as hospitals or certain organizations), and 'mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program'. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy in rural, underserved, and remote areas. The Program is mobile and authorized appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 are allocated."
