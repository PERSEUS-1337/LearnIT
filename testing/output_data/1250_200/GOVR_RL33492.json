    "content": "President Obama announced grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail, including $112 million for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. Congress passed a transportation appropriations act providing Amtrak with $1.565 billion for FY2010. The legislation also allocated $2.5 billion for high-speed rail projects, with Amtrak eligible for funding. Amtrak's interim CEO Joseph Boardman's appointment was extended indefinitely in December 2009. In March 2009, Congress passed the FY2009 transportation appropriation act, providing $1.490 billion for Amtrak, an increase from the previous year. Additionally, in February 2009, Congress allocated $1.3 billion for capital grants to Amtrak and $8 billion for intercity passenger rail infrastructure grants. In October 2008, the 110th Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, authorizing nearly $10 billion over five years for Amtrak, including capital and operating grants. Congress authorized $1.9 billion in intercity passenger rail capital grants to states, $1.5 billion for high-speed rail corridors, and $325 million for rail network congestion mitigation grants. The annual average for intercity passenger rail was $2.7 billion, double the recent years' appropriations. A procedure was established for proposals on high-speed rail development, requiring further legislation. The Surface Transportation Board was given a role in enforcing Amtrak priority over freight trains and facilitating negotiations between commuter rail operators and freight railroads. Amtrak, the nation's only provider of intercity passenger rail service, was created by Congress in 1970 to maintain a minimum level of service. Despite being structured as a private company, Amtrak receives significant federal assistance, totaling $30 billion from 1971-2006 and $7.0 billion from FY2007-FY2010. With approximately 19,000 employees operating trains over 21,000 miles of track, most of which is owned by freight railroads, Amtrak has struggled to make a profit like other intercity passenger rail operators. Amtrak operates approximately 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track, with most track owned by freight rail companies. The company is a minority user on certain portions of the Northeast Corridor (NEC), which is heavily used by commuter and freight trains. Amtrak operates corridor routes and long-distance routes, some of which receive state assistance. The company also provides commuter service under contract with state and local authorities. Despite inconsistent federal funding, Congress has provided an average of around $1.3 billion annually to keep Amtrak operating. Amtrak received around $1.3 billion annually from Congress to keep operating until FY2009. With new Administration support, funding increased to $2.8 billion, totaling $7.9 billion over five years. The DOT IG stated Amtrak needs $2 billion yearly for repairs and corridor service, or $1.4 billion to prevent further deterioration. A new federal intercity passenger rail strategy is deemed necessary due to financial instability and poor service quality. A new federal intercity passenger rail strategy is needed as the current model for Amtrak is financially unstable and provides poor service quality. Efforts to change Amtrak's structure and funding have been unsuccessful, leading to ongoing debt and operational challenges. The GAO criticized Amtrak's management in 2005, resulting in the firing of CEO David Gunn. The new CEO, Alexander Kummant, expressed commitment to maintaining a national system of trains, including long-distance routes. The House Railroads Subcommittee emphasized the importance of long-distance trains in the national transportation network. Amtrak's focus is on developing rail corridors between city pairs of 300-500 miles. Congress has implemented measures to increase transparency in Amtrak's finances and oversight by the Department of Transportation. Amtrak's funding is now allocated through the Secretary of Transportation, with quarterly grants made to Amtrak. Additional requirements were imposed in the 2008 reauthorization legislation, including performance improvement plans for long-distance routes and periodic reviews of compliance with accessibility requirements. Amtrak runs a yearly deficit of over a billion dollars, with most routes losing money, especially the long-distance ones. In 2004, long-distance trains had operating losses of over $600 million. Eliminating long-distance service would only reduce losses by about $300 million, not enough to make Amtrak profitable. The DOT IG found that long-distance trains accounted for 15% of total intercity rail ridership, with 77% of passengers traveling only portions of the routes. By eliminating sleeper class service, Amtrak could save between $75 million and $158 million annually, plus avoid $79 million in capital expenditures. Amtrak's restructuring of sleeper class service aimed to save up to $20 million in FY2007. The company faces major liabilities due to deferred maintenance and accumulated debt, with an estimated $6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs. The DOT IG criticized Amtrak's capital spending choices, highlighting the risk of major system failures due to deferred maintenance. Amtrak requires $1.5 billion to $2 billion in federal support annually, higher than previous funding levels. Despite cost-cutting measures and increased ridership, Amtrak still faces financial challenges. The DOT IG suggests addressing state-supported routes, route restructuring, and labor contracts to reduce operating subsidies. Labor productivity remains a concern compared to airlines on corridor routes. Amtrak competes with airlines on corridor routes in terms of labor productivity and faces challenges in reducing its annual deficit. The major cost categories are operating losses of long-distance trains and maintenance costs of the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak's interpretation of U.S.C. 24701 requires nationwide service, making it unlikely to eliminate long-distance routes without explicit direction from Congress. Despite growing same-route ridership since FY2004, Amtrak still requires significant federal support annually. Amtrak's same-route ridership has increased since FY2004, but it is unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover its deficits. Total revenues in FY2008 were $588 million higher than in FY2004, but expenses also rose. The annual loss decreased from $1.331 billion in FY2004 to $1.160 billion in FY2008. Amtrak's appropriations are part of the Department of Transportation funding, with Congress providing $1.325 billion for Amtrak in FY2008. President Bush requested $900 million, while Amtrak requested $1.671 billion citing rising fuel and healthcare costs. Amtrak requested $1.671 billion for its budget, citing increasing fuel, healthcare, and wage costs. They also highlighted issues with cracking concrete ties, aging rolling stock, and the need for replacements. Congress provided $1.490 billion for Amtrak in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, along with $90 million for state grants. In the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, Congress provided $1.490 billion for Amtrak, along with $90 million for state grants. Additionally, Amtrak received $1.3 billion for capital grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, with $450 million specifically for capital security grants. Congress also allocated $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, intercity passenger rail projects, and rail congestion relief grants, with Amtrak eligible for funding. President Obama announced the first round of grants from this funding, including $112 million for Amtrak. President Obama announced the first round of grants from an $8 billion fund for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail on January 28, 2010. Among the awards was $112 million for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. The Obama Administration requested $1.502 billion for Amtrak for FY2010, with Congress providing $1.584 billion for Amtrak in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Additionally, Congress provided $2.5 billion for grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail projects. In 2010, Congress provided $1.584 billion for Amtrak and $2.5 billion for grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail service. Amtrak's Inspector General resigned in June 2009, leading to an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding Amtrak's OIG as an independent agency. An amendment was added to the THUD bill requiring Amtrak to allow passengers to transport firearms in checked baggage by March 31, 2010, or lose federal funding. In the THUD bill, an amendment required Amtrak to allow firearms in checked baggage by March 31, 2010, or risk losing federal funding. Amtrak's previous authorization expired in 2002, and reauthorization was stalled between 2002 and 2008 due to disagreements over passenger rail policy. Congress did not provide the requested funding or require a restructuring during this period. Congress did not provide Amtrak with the requested funding or require restructuring during the period of reauthorization consideration. Options for passenger rail funding included higher levels of funding for expansion, maintenance of current system, focusing on economically justified corridors, reducing funding and network, or eliminating funding for Amtrak. The DOT IG stated that the \"status quo\" was unsustainable and recommended $1.4-1.5 billion in federal funding to prevent service cuts, but more would be needed for system repair and new corridor development. The DOT IG urged Congress to consider three points regarding Amtrak reauthorization: the need for competition to incentivize cost control, states to decide on passenger rail service, and adequate federal funding for infrastructure repair. A bill introduced in the 110th Congress would have authorized funding for Amtrak, with a percentage of capital grants directed to states. The bill introduced in the 110th Congress would direct a percentage of funding to states for rail service, potentially allowing competition for Amtrak. It would create a capital match program with an 80% federal share and require Amtrak to reduce operating subsidies by 40%. The bill would also expand Amtrak's board of directors and was approved by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in 2007. The bill introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to reform Amtrak by directing funding to states for rail service, creating a capital match program, and reducing operating subsidies. It was passed by the Senate with amendments, including requirements for Amtrak to publish revenue and cost amounts for each route and to consider states with limited service when adding new routes. The House version of the bill authorized $6.7 billion in grants to Amtrak for FY2009-FY2013. The House bill proposed $6.7 billion in grants to Amtrak for capital, operating, debt service, and ADA compliance. It also allocated $1.8 billion for high-speed rail corridors, including one between Washington, DC, and New York City. Private companies would bid for the development and operation of these corridors, with a requirement for express trains to travel between the two cities in under two hours. Additionally, Amtrak was required to submit a plan for restoring service between New Orleans and Sanford, Florida, and the board of directors would be restructured. The House and Senate bills aimed to restructure Amtrak's board of directors and involve the Surface Transportation Board in resolving disputes between freight railroads and passenger train interests. The Senate bill allowed for petitions to investigate Amtrak's on-time performance, while the House bill required non-binding mediation between freight railroads and public transit authorities. Congress reauthorized Amtrak in 2008 with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. This included operating grants, capital grants, grants for repayment of debts, and funding for Amtrak's Inspector General. The act also authorized new federal intercity passenger rail grant programs, such as the Intercity Passenger Rail Service Corridor Capital Assistance Program and High-Speed Rail Corridor Development. Total authorized Amtrak funding averaged $1.955 billion annually, a significant increase from previous years. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013, including grants for capital projects on high-speed rail lines and grants for congestion relief in intercity rail corridors. The act also directed FRA and Amtrak to develop measurement criteria for performance, establish methodologies for route decisions, and allocate costs between Amtrak and states. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with funding and directed the STB to investigate on-time performance issues, mediate disputes between freight railroads and public transit authorities, and increased the size of Amtrak's Board of Directors."
