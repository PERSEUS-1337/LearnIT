    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Court, Offender Supervision, Parole, and Public Defender Employees Equity Act of 2008\" allows retirement credit for certain employees transferred from District of Columbia service to federal service. The Act allows individuals who served in the District of Columbia to include that service in calculating their creditable service for specific provisions of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, but not for computing the amount of any annuity. Qualifying District of Columbia service is defined in the Act. Qualifying District of Columbia service includes service performed by nonjudicial employees of the District of Columbia courts and employees of entities of the District of Columbia government transferred to specific functions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Qualifying District of Columbia service includes service performed by employees of the Federal Government and the District of Columbia Public Defender Service, for which the individual did not receive credit under specific provisions of title 5, United States Code. Service performed by an individual in the Federal Government under the priority consideration program established by the Bureau of Prisons may include service from the District of Columbia Department of Corrections before the individual's coverage as a federal employee, for which credit was not previously received under specific provisions of title 5, United States Code. The Office of Personnel Management will accept certification from the District of Columbia government regarding an individual's qualifying service and its duration."
