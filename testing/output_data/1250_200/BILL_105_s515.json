    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act\". The increasingly litigious nature of the legal profession in the United States has created barriers for individuals to help others. Lawsuits, excessive damage awards, and unfair liability allocations hinder volunteerism and charitable service. Arbitrary damage awards contribute to high liability insurance costs for volunteers and organizations, making it difficult for them to be protected. Volunteer service organizations in the United States are suffering due to fears of frivolous lawsuits, leading to a decline in essential services such as crisis counseling and support for the elderly. Federal legislation is needed to clarify and limit personal liability risks for volunteers, as the national scope of the problem affects the citizens' dependence on volunteer services. Liability reform for volunteer service organizations is crucial to address fears of frivolous lawsuits and ensure the continued operation of essential services. This reform will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate commerce, and uphold constitutionally protected due process rights. The purposes of this Act are to provide protection from personal financial liability for volunteers and volunteer service organizations that provide services in good faith to promote social service program interests, sustain volunteer contributions, and ensure fairness in the civil justice system.
