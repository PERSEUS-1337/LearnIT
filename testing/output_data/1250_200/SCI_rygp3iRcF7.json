    "content": "Existing attention mechanisms focus on individual items in a collection, but area attention proposes attending to a group of spatially or temporally adjacent items. The size of the area is dynamically determined through learning, allowing for varying levels of granularity. Area attention can be used in conjunction with multi-head attention to attend to multiple areas in memory. It has been evaluated in tasks such as neural machine translation and image captioning, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Area attention is a novel concept that proposes attending to groups of adjacent items in memory, improving performance in tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning. It is parameter-free and efficiently computed using summed area tables. This attention mechanism allows models to selectively focus on specific information, enhancing accuracy in deep learning tasks. In recent architectures like Transformer BID15, self-attention involves queries and memory from the same modality. Each memory item has a key and value, used to compute the probability regarding how well the query matches the item. The output from querying the memory is calculated as the sum of all values weighted by their probabilities, which can be used for further calculations in the model. During training, the model learns to attend to specific pieces of information, improving performance in tasks like translation. Attention mechanisms focus on individual items in memory, defining the granularity of what the model can attend to.

Attention mechanisms focus on individual items in memory, defining the granularity of what the model can attend to. Area attention is proposed as a mechanism for the model to attend to a group of items in memory that are structurally adjacent, allowing for a more flexible and learned granularity of attention distribution.

Area attention can be used in multi-head attention, allowing the model to attend to multiple areas in memory. Extensive experiments show that area attention outperforms regular attention in various tasks such as machine translation and image captioning. Recent works have explored item-grouping in language-specific tasks, representing sentence segments for tasks like dependency parsing. Recent works have explored different methods for representing sentence segments in language-specific tasks, such as coreference resolution. While previous approaches rely on encodings that capture contextual dependencies between tokens, the proposed area attention method does not require each item to carry such information. This new approach calculates the mean of vectors in a segment using a different subtraction operation, showing promise in tasks like machine translation and image captioning. The proposed area attention method does not rely on contextual dependency between tokens like previous approaches. It does not require training a special network or using additional loss to capture structures, allowing a model to attend to specific segments without extra complexity. The proposed area attention method does not rely on contextual dependency between tokens like previous approaches. It allows a model to attend to information at varying granularity without additional complexity. By enhancing Transformer with area attention, state-of-the-art results were achieved on various tasks. An area is a group of structurally adjacent items in memory, useful for tasks like machine translation or sequence prediction. The proposed area attention method enhances Transformer models by allowing them to attend to information at varying granularity without additional complexity. Areas are groups of structurally adjacent items in memory, useful for tasks like machine translation or sequence prediction. The method generates multiple areas by combining adjacent items in the memory, with limits set on the maximum area size for both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional cases. The number of areas that can be generated is determined by the maximum size of an area and the length of the sequence. The area attention method enhances Transformer models by allowing them to attend to information at varying granularity. Areas are groups of adjacent items in memory, with limits on maximum size for 1D and 2D cases. The number of areas generated is determined by the maximum size and sequence length. Keys and values are defined for each area to calculate attention. The area attention method enhances Transformer models by allowing them to attend to information at varying granularity. Keys and values are defined for each area to calculate attention, which can be enriched by considering features like standard deviation, height, and width. These features are combined using a multi-layer perceptron and embedding matrices to form the representation of the shape of an area.

Keys and values are defined for each area to calculate attention, enriched by features like standard deviation, height, and width. These features are combined using a single-layer perceptron and a linear transformation, with a focus on the area value calculation for a 2-dimensional memory. The use of a summed area table optimization technique reduces computational complexity to O(|M |A). The integral image allows for quick calculation of key and value for each area in constant time. The sum of vectors in a rectangular area can be easily computed using the summed area table. Key quantities like vector mean, standard deviation, and sum can be efficiently computed for each area. The integral image enables rapid calculation of key and value for each area in constant time. Area attention was tested on neural machine translation and image captioning tasks, using popular encoder and decoder choices like LSTM and Transformer. Transformer has shown superior performance on English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, while LSTM with encoder-decoder attention is commonly used for neural machine translation. The datasets used contain millions of sentence pairs for each language. The dataset includes 4.5 million English-German and 36 million English-French sentence pairs. Transformer utilizes attention mechanisms in both encoder and decoder. Different configurations of Transformer were explored, ranging from Tiny to Big variations. Training batches consisted of approximately 32,000 tokens and were trained on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for 250,000 steps. The batch contained sentence pairs totaling around 32,000 tokens and was trained on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for 250,000 steps. Training times varied for Regular Attention and different forms of Area Attention. For the Big model, a smaller batch size of 16,000 tokens was used, trained for 600,000 steps. Area attention was applied to all Transformer variations, consistently improving performance. Area attention consistently improved Transformer models on various variations, outperforming regular attention. The use of area attention with Transformer Big achieved a BLEU score of 29.68 on EN-DE, surpassing the state-of-the-art result. The study also explored the impact of area attention on LSTM configurations for translation tasks, focusing on how it can enhance LSTM with varying capacity. The purpose is to observe the impact of area attention on LSTM configurations, focusing on improving GPU utilization by increasing data parallelism with larger batch sizes. LSTM models were trained on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100, using different batch sizes depending on the number of LSTM cells. Area attention consistently improved LSTM architectures in all conditions, similar to Transformer models. Character-level translation poses a more challenging task due to addressing longer sequences. \nThe purpose is to observe the impact of area attention on LSTM configurations, focusing on improving GPU utilization by increasing data parallelism.

The setup includes a pre-trained Inception-ResNet for image embeddings, a 6-layer Transformer for encoding and decoding, with a focus on area attention to improve captioning accuracy. Training was done on COCO dataset with 82K images for training and 40K for validation, using a distributed learning infrastructure with 10 GPU cores. Testing was conducted on COCO40 and Flickr 1K test sets. In this experiment, models with area attention outperformed the benchmark on both CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics with a large margin. Different maximum area sizes were added to the image encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention, showing improved captioning accuracy. In this paper, a novel attentional mechanism is introduced, allowing models to attend to areas as a whole. Areas can contain one or a group of items in memory to be attended, with the size of an area varying based on the coherence of adjacent items. This area attention outperformed the benchmark on CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics, with 3 \u00d7 3 achieving the best results overall.
