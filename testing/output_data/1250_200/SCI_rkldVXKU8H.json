    "content": "Foveation is compared to non-foveating deep networks using different variable-resolution downsampling methods in ImageNet recognition with a Densenet-121 network. The best variable-resolution method slightly outperforms uniform downsampling, suggesting that foveation does not significantly impact object recognition in deep networks. Different foveated downsampling approaches perform similarly to each other, with the best method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling. This indicates that foveation may not be crucial for object recognition but also does not interfere greatly. The study compared foveation to non-foveating deep networks in ImageNet recognition tasks using a DenseNet-121 network. Foveation did not significantly impact object recognition, suggesting it could be incorporated into general vision systems for robots performing multiple tasks. Training procedures included random flips and batch sizes, with networks trained for 90 epochs using SGD.

Foveation did not significantly impact object recognition, suggesting it could be incorporated into general vision systems for robots performing multiple tasks. Training procedures included random flips and batch sizes, with networks trained for 90 epochs using SGD. The resulting crop went outside the image boundaries, and multiple points were sometimes chosen in a single image. The highest-saliency points are typically close together and contain similar information. To avoid selecting multiple similar points, the saliency maps were modified after each selection by subtracting a square-gaussian function from the saliency map. This function had a peak equal to the saliency at the chosen point and a width of 60 pixels. It is interesting to explore potential benefits within more general vision systems."
