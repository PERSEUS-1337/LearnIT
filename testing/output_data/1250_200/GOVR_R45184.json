Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives have contributed to this decrease. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its social and economic costs, especially considering disparities among racial and ethnic groups and states. This report focuses on the teen birth rate, which refers to the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19. Data on births are distinct from data on pregnancies, with birth data accounting for nearly every birth in the United States. The CDC and the Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates, usually a year or two after birth data, incorporating data from various sources. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth. The teen birth rate in the United States has significantly declined over the years. In 2018, out of approximately 3.8 million births, 4.7% were to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and dropped by 72% from 1991 to 2018. The greatest decline occurred in recent years, with a 58% decrease from 2007 to 2018. The 2018 teen birth rate of 17.4 was a historical low since data collection began in the 1940s. The CDC began tracking subgroup data for teens in 1960, showing higher birth rates for older teens compared to younger teens. In 2018, birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births have declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015, with the highest prevalence among Hispanic youth. Teen mothers have been less likely to be married, with the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 decreasing from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. In 2018, the teen birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000, compared to 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. Despite an overall decline in the teen birth rate, rates for certain racial and ethnic groups remain high. Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens had more than double the birth rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The teen birth rate decreased for all racial and ethnic groups from 1991 to 2018, with varying declines among different groups. In 2018, birth rates for teens aged 15 to 19 varied by state and territory, with rates declining more for certain racial and ethnic groups. The rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. Despite greater declines for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens, their birth rates remained higher. Massachusetts had the lowest reported rate at 7.2, while Arkansas had the highest at 30.4. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens, while ten states had rates of 25 or higher. Teen birth rates varied by state and territory in 2018, with the highest rates in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. Rates ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. The rates decreased by 19% to 67% from 2007 to 2018. Teen birth rates in rural areas remain higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is higher than in most industrialized countries, with potential factors including economic conditions and contraceptive use among teens. Research indicates that the use of contraceptives among teens in the United States is lower compared to other developed countries. Factors contributing to the decline in teen pregnancy rates include improved contraceptive use, such as an increase in condom use and the use of multiple contraception methods. Recent declines in teen pregnancy risk are attributed to an increase in contraceptive use among sexually active teens, including the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives. Teens have increased their contraceptive use, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and the withdrawal method along with another method. Economic and social factors may influence teen behaviors, with some attributing the decline in teen birth rates to factors like expanded opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology. Observers also suggest that the recession starting in 2007 may have played a role in the decrease in teen births, as teenagers become more cautious during economic downturns. Other possible reasons for the decline include the role of social media and increased internet use in teens' knowledge about sex and birth. Teen birth rates have declined possibly due to factors like expanded opportunities for women, improvements in contraceptive technology, and the impact of the recession. Social media and internet use may also play a role in teens' knowledge about sex and birth control. Teen pregnancy prevention programs supported with federal funding could potentially contribute to the decline, but their exact impact is uncertain. Teenage parents often face challenges like lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Teen parents face challenges such as lower education levels and higher poverty rates, leading to reduced economic self-sufficiency. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, increasing the likelihood of pregnancy. Teen sexual activity can also increase the risk of STIs, impacting long-term health. Teen sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs, leading to long-term health issues. Teen childbearing can have negative impacts on the offspring, including chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, and higher likelihood of teen pregnancy or incarceration. Societal impacts of teen childbearing include cost savings to public programs from avoiding unintended pregnancies. A simulation analysis estimated $4.4 billion in total savings from decreased teen fertility rates between 1991 and 2015. The analysis estimated $4.4 billion in total savings from decreased teen fertility rates between 1991 and 2015, considering cost savings to Medicaid and public programs. Further research on the impacts of decreased teenage pregnancy and childbearing is needed to inform policies and outcomes for teen parents, their children, and society."
