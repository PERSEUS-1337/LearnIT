First priority is for vessels documented in the US or with rights under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Second priority is for foreign-documented vessels already permitted. Third priority is for other vessels. Permits for foreign-documented vessels can be revoked or not renewed. The Secretary of the Interior can revoke permits for foreign-documented vessels in National Park System units if a US-documented vessel requests permission and there is a limit on permits.

Those whose permits are revoked have the right of first refusal for a new permit in the same unit. Permit holders whose permits are revoked or not renewed have the right of first refusal for a new permit in the same National Park System unit. The right is limited to the number of permits that were revoked or not renewed."
