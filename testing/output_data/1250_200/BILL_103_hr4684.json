    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Department of Energy High Energy and Nuclear Physics Authorization Act of 1994. Definitions are provided in the Act. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as CERN, construction, conventional construction, Department, Large Hadron Collider project, and Secretary. Authorized appropriations for high energy physics activities of the Department include $695.4 million for fiscal year 1996, $719.7 million for fiscal year 1997, $744.9 million for fiscal year 1998, and $713.6 million for fiscal year 1999. Funds can be used for the B-factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the Fermilab Main Injector. No funds are authorized for the US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project until an international agreement is in place. For nuclear physics activities, $337.1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1996, with a portion allocated for decontamination and decommissioning of the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility, and $348.9 million for fiscal year 1997. Authorized appropriations for high energy physics activities of the Department include funding for the decontamination and decommissioning of the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. Funds are allocated for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. No funds may be expended for high energy and nuclear physics facility construction projects exceeding $100,000,000 without specific authorization. SEC. 4. THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER PROJECT. The Secretary will negotiate with CERN for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, cost control, and reconsideration of US involvement if project milestones are not met. The Secretary will negotiate US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, cost control, and reconsideration if milestones are not met. This includes conditions for access for US and other scientists to the facility. Nothing in this Act precludes the President from entering into international science agreements. Within 30 days of an Act appropriating funds for high energy or nuclear physics activities, the Secretary must submit an operating plan to relevant committees. Additionally, a long-range planning and governance section is included. The Secretary is required to contract an independent organization to review the governance of the Department's high energy and nuclear physics programs, including performance evaluation, regulatory compliance, and advisory group representation. The Secretary must contract an independent organization to review the governance of high energy and nuclear physics programs. A report detailing the review results and recommendations for implementation must be submitted to Congress. Additionally, a long-range plan for Federal programs, developed in consultation with the physics communities, must be modified every two years and include research opportunities listed by priority. The biennial plan must include ongoing and proposed activities, prioritize research opportunities, analyze facility relevance, balance operations and support, provide schedules for program continuation or termination, coordinate with the international community, and detail modifications from previous plans. The biennial plan modifications for high energy and nuclear physics programs are to be submitted with the President's annual budget request to Congress. The reports must demonstrate consistency between the long-range plan and the budget being requested. The budget requests must distinguish between capital expenditures and other activities."
