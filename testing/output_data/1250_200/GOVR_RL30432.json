    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. The NSR process ensures proposed sources won't violate NAAQS or exceed air pollution limits under PSD regulations. The New Source Review (NSR) process is triggered for new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Requirements depend on whether the source is subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions, with installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) mandated. Few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants under NSR. Preconstruction permits for coal-fired power plants have been limited, which is not surprising given the steady capacity of 300,000 MW in the U.S. over the last decade. Emissions trends show a static situation for coal-fired capacity, with NOx emissions remaining constant but a significant drop in SO2 emissions in 1995 due to the acid rain control program. This program required 111 power plants to reduce emissions by 30% and install Low-NOx burners. The EPA required 111 power plants to reduce emissions by 30% and install Low-NOx burners. SO2 emissions decreased from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995, while NOx emissions decreased by 0.4 million tons in 1996. However, some reductions were offset by increases in emissions from other plants, indicating a slippage in overall emission reductions. The EPA lawsuits question the increasing emissions from existing coal-fired facilities despite efforts to optimize performance and maintain efficiency. Despite the lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have continued to climb over the past decade. Utilization of coal-fired capacity has increased, and the efficiency of units has not decreased, suggesting a fundamental change in the economics of plant maintenance. The EPA lawsuits question whether efforts to maintain or expand coal-fired facilities constitute \"routine maintenance\" or a \"major modification\" under the Clean Air Act. Utilities are hesitant to use the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to regulations on emissions from plants built after 1971. This issue is expected to intensify with the focus on plant economics in the electric utility industry. The 1970 Clean Air Act requires power plants built after August 1971 to limit emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide. Plants built before 1971 are exempt, but can lose this exemption if they are modified in a major way. There is ongoing regulatory activity related to electricity generation and air quality, including NSR enforcement as a primary tool for enforcing existing laws and regulations. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR aim to enforce existing laws and regulations, not create new ones. NSR actions are distinct from regulatory development, with EPA handling enforcement separately. EPA's enforcement actions under NSR stem from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. NSR allows EPA to impose monetary penalties and require affected sources to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 emissions. EPA can also enforce new NOx standards for utility boilers. The EPA has enforced new regulations under NSR to reduce emissions from coal-fired utility boilers, requiring the installation of control devices like scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction units. These measures could lead to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, equivalent to removing millions of cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that the operation of aging coal-fired plants will continue under electric utility restructuring. The EPA has enforced new regulations under NSR to reduce emissions from coal-fired utility boilers, requiring the installation of control devices. Extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is seen as a cost-effective alternative to constructing new capacity, with a trend towards renovating existing plants. However, enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired facilities has been challenging for the EPA. The EPA has faced challenges in enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities due to budget constraints and difficulties in defining major modifications. The definition of modification under the CAA has evolved over time, with EPA regulations focusing on increases in emissions or replacement of components exceeding 50% of fixed capital costs. The EPA's enforcement of NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities has been challenging due to budget constraints and difficulties in defining major modifications. The costs of building a new facility placed the plant under NSPS, but with the advent of NSR in 1977, a different approach to defining modification was needed. EPA defined a \"significant\" increase in emissions as exceeding 40 tons per year for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, subjecting facilities to NSR. Enforcing these thresholds has proven difficult, as they do not necessarily constrain life extension efforts by utilities. Life extension efforts typically improve availability and reliability of generating units without increasing their maximum hourly emission rate. In the late 1980s, EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts, such as Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO), due to potential increased emissions post-project. After litigation and debate, EPA modified the emissions trigger in 1992 to compare actual emissions before and after modifications. The new \"test\" compares a facility's actual emissions before modification with projected actual emissions after modification. The current NSR regulations for utility plants define actual emissions before and after modifications. Utilities have adjusted their life extension activities to fit into routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and asset management instead of \"life extension.\" The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for coal-fired capacity by utilities. EPA issued a Compliance Order for modifications by Tennessee Valley Authority's coal-fired plants. Tables identify facilities cited for violating NSR. The Justice Department/EPA has filed lawsuits against coal-fired power plants for violating NSR requirements under the Clean Air Act. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil penalties for past violations, requiring facilities to comply with CAA requirements, install BACT, apply for permits, and audit operations for NSR compliance. EPA's compliance order for TVA's plants includes developing a schedule for meeting requirements and auditing for NSR compliance. The compliance order requires TVA to develop a schedule for meeting all requirements affecting specified facilities, audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retire SO2 allowances equal to any reductions. The industry's response focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations, arguing that EPA is changing the rules mid-game. Industry asserts that the activities triggering NSR violations were previously accepted by EPA. The industry argues that activities violating NSR are necessary for plant operation and should not trigger major modifications. EPA states controlling emissions could lead to significant reductions. The EPA's NSR action could lead to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, compensating for previous slippages in reductions. However, the complexity of the Clean Air Act means that reductions achieved under NSR would interact with requirements under title IV, which limits total SO2 emissions from utilities. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements for SO2 emissions from utility plants. It created an emissions allowance system for existing facilities to trade or bank allowances for future use. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The NSR program focuses on facility modifications and BACT installation, while Title IV aims to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for utilities. NSR enforces individual plant standards, while Title IV allows for excess allowances from BACT installations to be sold. Compliance with the cap is crucial under Title IV, which may render NSR reductions moot if excess allowances are sold to other facilities. The interaction between NSR enforcement and Title IV regulations could potentially nullify reductions achieved through NSR actions if excess allowances are sold to other facilities. Title IV does not provide for adjustments in allowance allocations due to NSR enforcement, and utilities may need to surrender excess allowances voluntarily to avoid this issue. The situation with potential NOx reduction is complex due to the interaction of NSR and the NOx NSPS, which historically has not reflected the latest technology developments. The 1979 NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities required 0.6/0.5 lb. of NOx per million Btu of heat input, achievable with simple combustion modifications. In 1998, a new standard of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu was set but was challenged in court. The D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new standard for modified utility boilers, reverting back to the 1979 standard until a revised NSPS is proposed. This uncertainty impacts the determination of BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The 1998 NSPS for NOx emissions was challenged in court, leading to confusion over whether the current standard is the 1979 or 1998 NSPS. The interaction of NSR and title IV further complicates matters, with the title IV NOx program having more stringent emission rates than the NSPS program. Existing coal-fired facilities may have emission controls stricter than the NSPS due to the title IV program. BACT determinations from 1991-1995 do not provide clarity on current standards. The court action on the modified NSPS continues currently, with uncertainty on current BACT determinations for NOx emissions. EPA aims to enforce NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but concerns arise over costly litigation and effectiveness compared to other pollution control methods. NSR was an initial approach to emission control, but more efficient methods have since been developed. Efficient methods for reducing emissions from existing sources have been developed since NSR provisions were added to the CAA in 1977. Title IV of the CAA, enacted in 1990, significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV had 100% compliance and was more effective than NSR in reducing emissions. One alternative suggested is to expand on the success of title IV's cap and trade program by lowering the cap on emissions. One alternative proposed is to lower the cap on emissions, which could achieve similar reductions as existing power plants meeting the 1978 NSPS. This would require new legislation and could provide utilities with flexibility in achieving reductions. Additionally, a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives regarding NOx emissions. EPA is encouraging states to consider a regional cap and trade program for compliance with regulations. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program for compliance with regulations such as the Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126 petitions. Implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx emissions would require cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Other regulatory initiatives, like the fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze rule, will also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, but their implementation schedules are lengthy. The implementation schedules for regulations requiring reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions are long, with few reductions before 2010. Alternative options include tightening the SO2 cap and creating an NOx cap without needing further legislative authority. Another option is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, which could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. Currently, CO2 is not considered an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act, and regulating mercury emissions from utility boilers has been slow. The EPA's authority to regulate CO2 is controversial, so reductions would likely come from voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The EPA is considering reforms to the NSR program, including the proposal of \"off-ramps\" like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for existing units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. This reform aims to simplify the NSR trigger and acknowledges that significant emission reductions may not be achieved if units are already well-controlled. The EPA is proposing a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology under the NSR program. This reform aims to simplify the NSR trigger and acknowledges that significant emission reductions may not be achieved if units are already well-controlled. EPA is also considering cap and trade programs as a more cost-effective alternative to NSR. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants. The popular debate on NSR has centered around \"grandfathered\" power plants, which are older coal-burning plants exempt from strict pollution control regulations. Industry lobbyists argued that these plants would soon retire, avoiding costly retrofits. However, many of these plants from the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered power plant\" is used in discussions on emissions from existing plants, indicating if they are covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act's Section 111 requires the EPA to set emission standards for new sources like power plants. NSPS regulations cover pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" refers to older plants not subject to NSPS regulations. Some pollutants are regulated by State Implementation Plans instead of NSPS. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous due to NSPS requirements. The term \"grandfathered\" in the NSPS regulations for power plants is ambiguous due to the lack of a set baseline and the evolving stringency of emission standards. Some pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury are not covered by NSPS, making the term meaningless for these emissions. The Clean Air Act's Title IV also plays a role in regulating existing power plants for pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless when considering emissions standards, with a focus on fuel sources for NOx controls and Title IV emissions cap for SO2 controls. Age of the plant is not a relevant factor in these debates. The Title IV emissions cap is crucial when considering emission credits allocation based on plant operational status. NSPS compliance is not the determining factor, as new power plants must offset all emissions under the cap. Shrinking the current SO2 cap and implementing a NOx emission cap are logical approaches to reduce emissions from electric generating facilities. EPA supports state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the DOJ/EPA actions on NSR, raising issues on legislative intent of CAA provisions. The DOJ/EPA actions on NSR are raising issues on the legislative intent of CAA provisions, especially regarding modifications of existing sources. Addressing NSR issues may require new legislation to bring consistency to the provisions and update the Clean Air Act's approach to regulating the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
