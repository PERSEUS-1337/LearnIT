    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act\" or the \"SENSE Act\". Standards for coal refuse power plants are outlined in the Act. The \"SENSE Act\" defines key terms related to coal refuse power plants, including the Administrator of the EPA, boiler operating day, coal refuse, and coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit. The \"SENSE Act\" defines terms related to coal refuse power plants, including coal refuse-fired facilities and electric utility steam generating units. It also sets emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide as hazardous air pollutants. The \"SENSE Act\" sets emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide as hazardous air pollutants from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units under the Clean Air Act. The operator can choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards, but not both. The \"SENSE Act\" establishes emission standards for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units under the Clean Air Act. Operators can choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards, but not both. The emission standards for hydrogen chloride are set at 0.002 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input or 0.02 pounds per megawatt-hour, while the standard for sulfur dioxide is 0.20 pounds. An emission standard for sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units is set at 0.20 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input, 1.5 pounds per megawatt-hour, or capture and control of 93 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions. The emission standard for sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units is set at 0.20 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input, or 1.5 pounds per megawatt-hour, measured as a 30 boiler operating day rolling average per unit or group of units. Emissions are calculated based on fuel samples and measured by a continuous monitoring system. Passed the House of Representatives on March 8, 2018. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
