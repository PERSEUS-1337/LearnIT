    "content": "On October 29, House and Senate appropriators announced a conference agreement on H.R. 3289, a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was approved by the House and Senate, and signed into law by the President on November 6. The conference agreement rejected a Senate proposal for Iraq reconstruction assistance to be provided as loans. The President had requested an additional $87 billion for reconstruction assistance and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. During congressional consideration of the request for reconstruction aid in Iraq, a wide range of legislative proposals were debated, including measures to address costs, burden sharing, and other issues. These proposals included requiring reports on Iraq policy, encouraging allied contributions, transferring control of reconstruction from the Defense Department to the State Department, and ensuring fair competition on contracts. The debate in Congress focused on providing Iraq reconstruction funds as grants or loans. The $87 billion requested by the Administration included $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. Of the defense funding, $51.5 billion was for ongoing military operations in Iraq, $10.5 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and $3.6 billion for homeland defense and support to allies. For foreign policy programs, $20.3 billion was allocated for security and reconstruction in Iraq. The Administration requested $87 billion, including $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. Of the defense funding, $51.5 billion was for ongoing military operations in Iraq, $10.5 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and $3.6 billion for homeland defense and support to allies. $20.3 billion was allocated for security and reconstruction in Iraq, with smaller amounts for Afghanistan and other Global War on Terrorism initiatives. The $87 billion request covers pressing defense and Iraq reconstruction needs through FY2004. The request assumes current troop levels and pace of operations will continue unchanged. $20 billion is requested for Iraq reconstruction, but estimates suggest $50-75 billion may be needed in the long run. The World Bank and UNDP estimate $36 billion for reconstruction in key sectors over four years. The U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority estimated $55 billion for reconstruction costs through 2007, with $17.5 billion in 2004 alone. Iraqi oil revenues and international support are expected to help meet remaining needs. However, Iraqi oil revenues are projected to be $12 billion next year, leaving no funds for reconstruction in the near term. The request for $87 billion for defense and reconstruction assistance is in addition to over $110 billion provided since 9/11. Since September 11, Congress has appropriated about $12 billion for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction and foreign aid to \"front-line\" states in the global war on terrorism. Of that, Congress has provided $1.4 billion in reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and $2.5 billion in foreign operations funding for relief and reconstruction in Iraq. Additional funding for Iraq totals $1.6 billion, with $1.1 billion from Department of Defense funds. The reconstruction totals $1.6 billion, with $1.1 billion from Department of Defense funds and the rest from the regular USAID budget. The debate in Congress on the $87 billion request focused on cost issues, including impact on the federal budget, accuracy of cost projections, and future costs. The OMB mid-session review estimated a federal budget deficit of $455 billion in FY2003 and $475 billion in FY2004, with the additional $87 billion pushing the deficit to about $525 billion for FY2004. The requested additional appropriations of $87 billion for FY2004 would push the deficit to about $525 billion for that year, according to officials. The Congressional Budget Office projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004. The CBO estimate for FY2004 already included additional supplemental appropriations for military activities. Administration officials argued that the economy can absorb the federal borrowing entailed by the supplemental, as the economy is still recovering from recession. OMB economic projections show a deficit of $525 billion in FY2004, totaling 4.4% of GDP. Congressional critics argue that borrowing 20%-25% of the federal budget is fiscally irresponsible and could endanger the economy in the long term. Some suggest financing Iraq's reconstruction costs as loans to generate future revenue for the US. Administration officials were hesitant to provide long-term cost estimates for the war with Iraq. In a Senate hearing, Senator Levin recalled Larry Lindsey's $100-200 billion estimate for a conflict with Iraq, which was dismissed by other officials. Administration projected costs at $50 billion, but later post-war expenses were not considered. Legislators accused the Administration of withholding cost projections to avoid opposition to tax cut legislation. Independent estimates were made before the war, including assessments by the Congressional Budget Office. Several independent estimates of war costs and post-war expenses were prepared before the war began, projecting higher costs than the Administration provided. Estimates of reconstruction costs, including a request for $20 billion for Iraq, were a focus of attention. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz mentioned potential oil revenues of $50-100 billion for Iraq over the next few years. The U.S. government underestimated Iraq reconstruction costs, attributing the country's infrastructure damage to Saddam Hussein's regime. Questions remain about the accuracy of military and reconstruction cost projections. Many questions remain about the accuracy of recent military and reconstruction cost projections in Iraq. Officials believe no need for more U.S. troops due to progress in Iraqi security forces and contributions from other nations. Cost projections assume current force levels and pace of operations will be maintained, but the security situation's improvement is debated. Questions also arise about specific elements of the Defense Department's funding request. In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, questions were raised about the Defense Department's supplemental funding request, specifically regarding the urgency of funding for military construction, R&D projects, and base camp housing. Concerns were also raised about the lack of funding for \"reconstituting\" Army forces, which could lead to future funding needs. The current force level's sustainability was questioned, with potential implications for reserve personnel retention. Several Members of Congress have proposed increasing the size of the Army to ease pressures on the force, but the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warns that implementation could take up to five years and cost $9-10 billion annually. Officials underestimated Iraq's infrastructure weakness and overestimated short-term oil revenues. The reconstruction financing gap remains unclear, with varying estimates of costs and contributions from multilateral donors. Undersecretary of State Larson emphasized the need for bilateral donors and international financial institutions to contribute, but specific figures are not available. The Administration emphasized the need for bilateral donors and international financial institutions to contribute to Iraq's reconstruction costs. U.N. officials estimate $2 billion will be pledged for 2004, with the World Bank recommending $1 billion in loans through June 30, 2005. The duration of U.S. military presence in Iraq remains uncertain, with some suggesting involvement for five years or more. Lt. Gen. Carlos Sanchez stated it will be \"a few years\" before the U.S. can withdraw from Iraq. The House Budget Committee Democratic Staff projects the long-term cost of the war in Iraq to be over $178 billion, potentially exceeding $400 billion. Legislative measures include proposals for congressional oversight, funding for various programs, health insurance for military reservists, competitive contracting, and providing loans for Iraq reconstruction. Proposals in Congress include oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq, with a focus on economic and security situations. Senator Feinstein introduced a bill requiring a detailed report on various aspects of the situation in Iraq, echoing similar proposals in Congress. Senate has adopted amendments for reporting requirements. In Congress, various proposals were considered regarding oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq. Senator Feinstein introduced a bill for detailed reporting requirements, which was echoed in other proposals. Senator Biden proposed offsetting costs of a supplemental bill by delaying tax cuts for the top 1% of taxpayers. The Senate rejected an amendment to limit the reduction in the top marginal income tax rate. In the House, Representative Obey proposed a substitute bill to offset costs by reversing tax cuts and address funding for domestic programs. Legislators criticized the Administration for opposing domestic spending while requesting more for Iraq. Senator Stabenow's amendment to reduce Iraq reconstruction funding by $5 billion and transfer it to domestic priorities was rejected. Various measures for funding domestic and international programs were under debate in Congress. Several measures were debated in Congress to provide funds for domestic and international programs. Amendments were proposed for additional funding for homeland security, AmeriCorps, and international HIV/AIDS. The House added funds for Liberia peacekeeping and reconstruction, while the Senate included funds for Liberia and U.N. peacekeeping operations. There was a discussion on adding $1.4 billion for veterans health benefits, and a Senate-approved amendment offered health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program. The FY2004 defense authorization bill included a provision to offer health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program. The cost was estimated to be $500 million in FY2004 and over $2 billion a year by FY2008. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if this provision was included. The Senate approved an amendment to provide health insurance to non-activated reservists, particularly those who are unemployed or ineligible for employer-provided insurance. Several legislators addressed concerns about companies like Halliburton earning excessive profits from non-competitive contracts for support of U.S. forces and reconstruction activities in Iraq. Various measures were proposed, including the Clean Contracting in Iraq Act of 2003 and amendments to stiffen penalties for fraud and profiteering on contracts. The enacted legislation included provisions to limit non-competitive procedures for reconstruction contracts and require oil infrastructure procurement to follow normal competitive bidding procedures. Several Members drafted amendments to require portions of the $20.3 billion Iraq reconstruction request to be guaranteed by Iraqi oil or extended as loans rather than grants. The Senate adopted language to convert $10 billion of Iraq reconstruction funding to loans, with the condition that if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt, the loans would be treated as grants. Other unsuccessful attempts included creating an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority to finance infrastructure rehabilitation through future sales of Iraq oil. The Senate adopted language to convert $10 billion of Iraq reconstruction funding to loans, with the condition that if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt, the loans would be treated as grants. Representative Wamp offered a proposal during House Committee markup that would have made half of the reconstruction available only after an elected government was in place and only on a loan basis. Senator Hutchison introduced an amendment directing $10 billion of the proposed $20.3 billion supplemental to an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund within the World Bank for economic development projects in Iraq. The Senate and House approved a bill for reconstruction loans to the Iraq Governing Council, despite concerns about increasing Iraq's debt. The President signed the bill into law as P.L. 108-106 on November 6. The Senate and House approved a bill for reconstruction loans to the Iraq Governing Council, signed into law as P.L. 108-106 on November 6.

Additionally, it extended increased benefits for troops deployed in conflict areas and allocated additional funding for Army operations and maintenance. The bill provided an additional $962 million for Army operations and maintenance, including funding for body armor, battlefield ordinance cleanup, and transportation of combat equipment. It also allowed the Defense Department to transfer up to $2.5 billion among defense accounts without advance congressional approval. Senator Byrd proposed measures to limit the funding flexibility, and the bill provided $200 million for training and equipment for the Iraqi and Afghan armies. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $200 million for training and equipment for the new Iraqi Army and the Afghan National Army, which is less than the requested $500 million. Additionally, $1.0 billion was allocated for \"coalition support\" to reimburse Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating nations. The committee debated reconstruction funds, rejecting amendments to eliminate most of the funds and limit transfer authority for defense programs. The total funding for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction and global war on terrorism was $21.445 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the full request for Afghanistan and approved $20.3 billion for Iraq reconstruction. They provided flexibility for resource allocation and deleted $60.5 million for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq. Instead, they allocated $60.5 million for USAID's Capital Investment Fund in Afghanistan. Additionally, the committee earmarked $100 million for other purposes. The Senate panel approved $20.3 billion for Iraq reconstruction, earmarking $100 million for democracy-building activities. They also imposed fines for war profiteering and fraud in Iraq. Senator Dorgan's amendments to reduce U.S. costs were tabled. Senator Dorgan proposed amendments to reduce U.S. expenditures on Iraq reconstruction projects by creating a financing facility and converting grants to loans. However, the Senate tabled the proposals, citing concerns about adding to Iraq's debt obligations. Additionally, Senator Harkin's proposal to reduce reconstruction funds and delay additional requests was also tabled.

Discussions also included adding funds to assist Liberia. During Senate deliberations, a $10 billion loan provision was adopted by a 51-47 vote, with the possibility of converting the loans into grants if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Another proposal discussed was the creation of an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund within the World Bank, governed by a Board of Trustees to provide loans and guarantees for economic development projects in Iraq. The Senate discussed proposals for a $10 billion loan provision and the creation of an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund within the World Bank. Senator Hutchison's amendment to direct $10 billion to the Trust Fund was not voted on, while another proposal by Senators Bayh and Nelson aimed to forgive Iraq's debt incurred during the Saddam Hussein regime before allocating reconstruction funds. During the seven days of debate through October 16, the Senate adopted almost 50 amendments, including requirements for competitive procedures in contracts over $1 million for military purposes in Iraq, prioritizing women's issues in reconstruction programs, and reporting on efforts to increase contributions for Iraq reconstruction.

The Office of Management and Budget Director warned of a potential veto if the bill included loans for Iraq reconstruction funds and opposed the funding for veterans' health care. The House-Senate conference considered providing Iraq reconstruction funds as loans, rejecting a proposal to allocate half of the $18 billion as loans. The conference agreement included $500 million for FEMA disaster relief, eliminated a House provision for coordinating Iraq aid, and rejected a proposal for Senate confirmation of the director of the Iraq Coalition Provisional Authority.

The Administration's proposal allocates $66 billion of the $87 billion total to military and intelligence operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided full funding for defense, with additional funds for Army operations and maintenance and weapons procurement. Senator Stevens mentioned that funding for veterans' health benefits would be addressed in a pending appropriations bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided full funding for defense in the FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations, with additional funds for Army operations and maintenance and weapons procurement. The House Appropriations Committee cut about $289 million from the defense total, mainly adding funds for Army weapons procurement. Key aspects of the request include cost projections, funding flexibility, authority to train and equip foreign military forces, and military personnel benefits. The FY2004 defense budget request includes maintaining current operations pace, reducing Army combat divisions in Iraq, using the COST model for cost estimation, and historical cost factors for projected costs. The Defense Department is using the COST model for detailed cost breakdowns before operations, which are considered reliable but not budget quality data for congressional requests. The Department's new cost estimates for war are higher than Congressional Budget Office estimates, with flexibility needed for fund reallocation. The Administration and Congress have an ongoing issue regarding the Defense Department's flexibility in reallocating funds. In the FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental, $59.9 billion was proposed for the Iraq Freedom Fund, with Congress agreeing to provide $15.7 billion. The Defense Department requested $2.0 billion for the fund in the new request, with the rest in regular appropriations accounts. The fund serves as a contingency fund for supporting multinational divisions or deploying Army National Guard Enhanced Separate Brigades and Marine Expeditionary Force. Additionally, the Defense Department requested authority to transfer $5 billion between appropriations accounts with congressional notification.

There is a proposal to provide $500 million for a contingency construction account and $200 million for training and equipping military forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other friendly countries for counter-terrorism operations and support U.S. military operations. Congress has rejected requests for funds for the Defense Department to train and equip foreign militaries. The Administration requested $200 million for training and equipping the new Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army, but Congress did not approve it. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to provide $200 million for this purpose, while the House Appropriations Committee provided $100 million. Congress also increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance in the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental, which expired at the end of FY2003. The benefits were extended through October 31, 2003, in the first continuing resolution for FY2004. The House and Senate have differing approaches on extending benefits permanently for troops. The Defense Department requested increased pay through December 31, 2003, and then $225 per month in Hardship Duty Pay for personnel in combat zones. Both House and Senate Committees extended benefits through FY2004 despite Administration's request. Troops not in combat zones may receive less pay, leading to potential opposition. The Senate extended Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004, and approved an amendment to offer health insurance to non-activated military reservists through TRICARE, with a 28% co-payment requirement. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if this provision is included. The Daschle-Graham amendment offers health insurance to non-activated military reservists through TRICARE with a 28% co-payment requirement. The Administration sought $21.44 billion for reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $20.4 billion allocated for Iraq. Congress appropriated $9.6 billion in FY2003 for similar activities and is considering funding requests totaling $4.9 billion in the pending FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bill. The Administration proposed reallocating funds from Baghdad facilities in P.L. 108-11 for urgent USAID needs in Afghanistan. The Senate bill allocated separate funds for USAID in Afghanistan, making funds available for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Baghdad. The House bill and conference agreement provided funding for a new U.S. mission in Iraq and specified peacekeeping funds for both Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, the Administration is reprogramming $390 million for Afghan reconstruction from other defense, State Department, and foreign aid accounts. The Administration is reprogramming $390 million for Afghan reconstruction from defense, State Department, and foreign aid accounts. The Senate bill and conference agreement allocated $40 million for USAID operating expenses in Afghanistan. The House bill provided $100 million for disaster and famine relief aid for Liberia and Sudan, while the Senate bill designated $200 million for Liberia. The conference agreement allocated $210 million for Liberia and Sudan from various accounts. Additionally, the Administration proposed $11 million for security operations in Afghanistan under the Diplomatic and Consular Services account. The Senate bill and conference agreement allocated funds for Afghan reconstruction and security operations, as well as for disaster relief aid in Liberia and Sudan. The House bill provided funding for MRV fees, consular services, security measures in Afghanistan, and a diplomatic mission in Iraq. The conference agreement allocated funds for rewards, protecting foreign missions and officials in New York City, and security for international summits. The Administration requested $200 million for debt reduction for Pakistan from the regular FY2004 Foreign Operations Appropriation. The $20.3 billion supplemental request for reconstruction and security in Iraq was a significant increase from previous amounts allocated. The $20.3 billion supplemental request for reconstruction and security in Iraq aimed to address urgent needs in security and infrastructure, including training and equipment for security forces, infrastructure improvements in electricity, oil, water, transportation, and healthcare. Other areas like government reform, agriculture, economic development, and education were not included in the request. The Administration's $20.3 billion supplemental request for reconstruction and security in Iraq focused on urgent needs in security and infrastructure, excluding other areas like government reform, agriculture, economic development, and education. A small amount of funds, $300 million, was requested for private sector growth and jobs training. The House bill excluded funds for Iraq traffic police and prisons, while the conference agreement reduced funding for various programs. The conference agreement reduced funds for various programs, including $25 million for consultants, $210 million for emergency oil supplies, and $153 million for solid waste management. Additionally, $4 million for a telephone numbering system, $9 million for postal information, and $10 million for TV and radio modernization were excluded. The Bush Administration's key policy objectives in Iraq included restoring basic services and rebuilding the economy and politics. The Coalition Provisional Authority, led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, aimed for Iraqi self-rule by appointing a Governing Council and encouraging local councils. Funding was allocated for clinics, hospitals, education, and small-medium enterprises, while excluding funds for an American-Iraqi Enterprise Fund and Public Information Centers. The U.S. occupation in Iraq has made progress in reconstituting civil and economic institutions, including schools, hospitals, and hospitals. Efforts have been made to renovate infrastructure such as power, water, and roads, while training new police and security forces. However, challenges remain in restoring order, security, and implementing political and economic reforms in a timely manner. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address infrastructure and security needs in Iraq. The national budget announced by the CPA estimated expenditures of $6.1 billion, with $3.9 billion coming from oil revenue, taxes, and profits. The remaining deficit of $4.3 billion would be covered by frozen assets, the Development Fund for Iraq, and U.S. assistance. Iraq was projected to have $1.1 billion remaining for reconstruction by the end of December 2003. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address infrastructure and security needs in Iraq. The Administration requested greater outlays of revenue for immediate reconstruction needs, as projected sources of revenue might not be as large as anticipated. The World Bank and U.N. Development Program conducted a needs assessment of 14 Iraqi economic and social sectors. At a donors conference in Madrid on October 24, the World Bank and U.N. Development Program released a needs assessment for 14 Iraqi economic and social sectors, estimating reconstruction costs at $36 billion over four years. The total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with concerns about Iraq's ability to absorb infrastructure commitments due to security issues. If Iraqi oil revenues fall short and international donors do not contribute significantly, the U.S. may face increased financial demands to meet Iraqi needs. The report suggests that Iraq can only absorb up to $6 billion for infrastructure programs in 2004 due to security concerns and slow implementation. The Administration requested $12.4 billion for infrastructure, with OMB confirming it covers 18 months. The request for electric power and water alone may meet needs beyond 18 months. Iraqi oil revenues were expected to fund reconstruction, but challenges in oil production may require increased financial support. Iraq's oil production is nearing 2 million barrels a day, but reaching prewar levels of 2.8 million barrels is not expected until spring. After accounting for domestic consumption, a production level of 2.3 million barrels could generate between $18.5 billion and $23 billion annually. The Administration's budget calculations assume an average production of 2 million barrels per day over the next 12 months, generating about $12 billion in revenues. Roughly $503 million has been allocated for oil facility repairs, with a request for $2.1 billion in the FY2004 supplemental budget. Additional funds for Iraqi security forces are also included. The Administration requested $2.1 billion in the FY2004 supplemental budget for Iraqi security forces to defend against oil facility sabotage. There was a debate on whether reconstruction assistance should be in the form of loans or grants, with concerns about adding to Iraq's existing debt of $200 billion. The Administration proposed offering the $20.3 billion supplemental as grants, while some argued for loans to be repaid in the future. Iraq owes roughly $200 billion in pre-war debts, reparations, and other claims. G7 leaders agreed to suspend the requirement for Iraq to service any existing debt through 2004. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 protects Iraqi oil exports from being attached by creditors until 2007 without Council authorization. The question arises on who could assume responsibility for new sovereign debt, with the possibility of the World Bank managing a reconstruction trust fund. Legal scholars suggest that until legal authority is transferred to Iraqi hands, the Coalition Provisional Authority would sign for any loans. Legal scholars debate whether an occupying power has the authority to incur new debts on behalf of a displaced sovereign. Some argue that a new government could be responsible for the debt if the loans were necessary for the welfare of the occupied territory. Congressional appropriation would be necessary for loan reconstruction assistance, with a large subsidy likely needed due to the uncertainty of Iraqi economy and debt repayment. The Senate debated converting $10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans, which could be turned back into grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Various amendments were proposed, including using Iraqi oil to secure financing and establishing a Trust Fund within the World Bank for loans and loan guarantees. Representative Wamp also proposed an amendment on the House side but later withdrew it. The House debated amendments to the reconstruction funds, including proposals to withhold funds until after Iraq's election, transfer funds to a World Bank loan facility, and shift grants to loans. The impact of the supplemental on international donors was also discussed, with concerns that reducing U.S. aid could affect contributions from other countries. Opponents of the Administration plan argued that providing U.S. aid for reconstruction as loans could lead other donors to do the same, increasing Iraq's debt. The supplemental focused on infrastructure and security, areas less likely to be supported by other donors who typically prioritize social sectors like education and health. Donors were hesitant to assist due to concerns about supporting a unilateral U.S. policy. To address this, creating Iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the U.N. or World Bank was discussed at a meeting in Brussels. Control over fund usage was a key factor for other donors. The reconstruction trust funds for Iraq were discussed at meetings in Brussels and Madrid, with the U.N. and World Bank managing the funds. The U.S. proposed a multilateral management board to oversee fund usage, including officials from international organizations, major donors, and Iraqis representing interim ministries. The White House wanted flexibility over fund distribution, including the ability to transfer funds to the Defense Department. The White House sought flexibility in distributing reconstruction funds for Iraq, facing criticism from Congress. Ultimately, Congress allowed the funds to be allocated among five agencies, including the Department of Defense. L. Paul Bremer managed the funds under the Coalition Provisional Authority, reporting to the Secretary of Defense. The Administration proposed placing the entire $20.3 billion in the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, continuing Bremer's role under DOD guidance. The White House established the Iraq Stabilization Group to aid reconstruction efforts and resolve decision-making disputes. The State Department's role in reconstruction policy is expected to increase, but Ambassador Bremer will still report to the Secretary of Defense. The Senate rejected an amendment to place the CPA under the Secretary of State's authority. The House bill included a provision to prevent coordination of defense or reconstruction activities by unconfirmed U.S. government officers in Iraq or Afghanistan. The House bill added a provision to prevent coordination of defense or reconstruction activities in Iraq or Afghanistan by unconfirmed U.S. government officers. The White House argued that the Iraq Stabilization Group does not affect control of reconstruction efforts, which remain under the Defense Department. The Administration's request for FY2004 reconstruction priorities and costs faced scrutiny in Congress. The detailed request for reconstruction of postal service business practices and construction of residential communities faced skepticism in Congress. Both the House and Senate proposed cuts in Iraq reconstruction funding, with reductions totaling $1.855 billion. The conference agreement followed the proposed cuts, including a reduction of $200 million for oil infrastructure rehabilitation. The enacted legislation reduced the President's $20.3 billion proposal for Iraq to $18.439 billion, with $210 million transferred to assistance for Jordan, Liberia, and Sudan. The Afghanistan supplemental aid request included $799 million in new appropriations to address immediate impact projects. The $799 million in new appropriations for Afghanistan included funding for security, government authority reinforcement, highway completion, and social programs. An additional $390 million would be available from prior-year funds, with no specified use. The White House also requested a limit on military drawdowns from DOD stocks. The White House requested an increase in the military drawdown limit from $300 million to $600 million. The enacted legislation allocated $365 million in reconstruction funding, with changes in infrastructure, governance, and social services. Notable additions include $60 million for women's programs. The conference agreement includes an earmark of $60 million from the ESF for women's programs in Afghanistan, focusing on technical and vocational education, programs against sexual abuse and trafficking, shelters, humanitarian assistance for widows, support for women-led NGOs, and training on women's rights. The U.S. assistance in Afghanistan since 2001 has focused on security, governance, and reconstruction, including efforts to establish security institutions, train the Afghan National Army, demobilize militias, and support provincial reconstruction. The establishment of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan aimed to create secure conditions for aid workers and extend the Kabul government's authority. Despite ongoing Taliban activity in the southeast, efforts have been made to combat insecurity and support humanitarian operations. The establishment of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan aims to create secure conditions for aid workers and extend the Kabul government's authority. PRTs, each with about 60 U.S. military personnel, have begun operations in various regions, with the possibility of expanding to 16 enclaves. The effectiveness of PRTs in improving security is debated, while governance and institution building efforts continue, with Hamid Karzai leading the interim administration until national elections in 2004. The jirga adjourned without establishing a new parliament, pending a constitutional loya jirga in December 2003 to shape a permanent governing structure. The draft constitution was made public in November 2003, with concerns about delays in the 2004 elections. Efforts to strengthen the Kabul government include the placement of 120 U.S. officials as advisers to Afghan ministries. Reconstruction in Afghanistan is a complex international effort. The international recovery and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan involves various stakeholders, including the Afghan government, U.N. agencies, donors, and NGOs. The intended outcomes include political stability, security, basic services, economic growth, and independence from foreign aid. Quick impact programs have transitioned to long-term projects in education, health, and infrastructure development. Successful reconstruction is crucial to prevent disillusionment and the resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan. According to observers, Afghans are frustrated with the slow progress of reconstruction due to factors like lack of security, capacity, and funding. Enhanced security and progress in reconstruction are essential to sustain donor involvement, encourage investment, and maintain hope for improvement in Afghanistan. Effective reconstruction assistance could reduce the war and drug economies and promote beneficial economic growth. Effective reconstruction assistance, as per USAID, could reduce war and drug economies, promote economic growth through government capacity building, employment generation, and agricultural rehabilitation. Other initiatives include road construction, urban reconstruction, infrastructure repair, energy development, and programs for women, education, health, and media. The strength of the central government is crucial for the success of international intervention. Efforts are being made to accelerate reconstruction before the 2004 elections to support moderates and attract more funding from the international donor community. Expanding the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is also under discussion. Increased funding for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan may lead to larger contributions from the donor community and potential expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). However, concerns exist about the impact of more money on corruption levels, absorption capacity, and effectiveness of fund allocation. There are also worries about the perception of excessive support for the Karzai government ahead of the upcoming elections. Other countries like Italy, Germany, the United States, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are involved in various reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The international community is assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, with countries like Italy providing advice on judicial reform and Germany helping establish a national police force. The United States, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are financing the construction of the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat highway. However, there are concerns about the insufficient funding pledged for reconstruction, with estimates indicating over $15 billion needed over the next decade. There are worries that donors might shift focus to Iraq reconstruction, potentially impacting Afghanistan's reconstruction efforts. The supplemental proposal included $201 million for various foreign policy initiatives related to the Global War on Terrorism, such as terrorist rewards and diplomatic security. Congress has been hesitant to create a foreign policy contingency fund despite repeated requests from Administrations. Congress has been hesitant to support requests for a Complex Foreign Crises Fund, preferring to allocate resources for specific needs in Iraq and coalition partners. The FY2003 supplemental legislation provided relief aid for Liberia and Sudan instead of creating the Emergency Fund for Complex Crises. Congress also included provisions to extend aid waivers for Pakistan. The FY2003 supplemental legislation provided relief aid for Liberia and Sudan instead of creating the Emergency Fund for Complex Crises. Congress also included provisions to extend aid waivers for Pakistan through FY2004. The current waiver expires on September 30, 2003, and includes $200 million in economic aid for Pakistan for debt reduction. Additionally, $100 million in economic aid for Jordan was provided in the enacted supplemental.
