    "content": "The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Gun Show Background Check Act.\" The Congress finds that approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually in the US, attracting thousands of attendees and providing a convenient location for criminals to obtain firearms without background checks. The term \"gun show\" is defined as an event with 50 or more firearms offered for sale, exchange, or transfer. The term \"gun show vendor\" refers to a person who is not licensed under section 923 and exhibits, sells, or offers firearms at events with specific criteria, excluding private sales from personal collections or events with limited attendees who are members of hunting organizations. Regulation of firearms transfers at gun shows includes defining a \"gun show vendor\" as someone not licensed under section 923 who sells firearms at these events. Gun show operators must meet certain criteria, including being at least 21 years old and not prohibited from transporting firearms. To transport firearms at gun shows, individuals must meet specific criteria, including registering with the Attorney General, providing fingerprints and a photograph, and paying a fee. They must also not have violated any firearm regulations or made false statements during registration. Gun show operators must notify the Attorney General of the event details and verify the identity of vendors before the show begins. Gun show operators must maintain records of individuals attending the event, including photographs and identifying information. Attendees must sign a ledger and a notice outlining the vendor's obligations under the law. The operator must also notify attendees of the legal requirements, as specified by the Attorney General. The Attorney General requires compliance with regulations for firearm transfers between unlicensed persons at gun shows, including background checks through the national instant criminal background check system. The licensee must provide a unique identification number from the national instant criminal background check system to ensure the transfer of a firearm does not violate federal or state laws. Additionally, the licensee must submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days of the transfer, detailing the firearm's make, model, and serial number, as well as other required information. The report must not disclose personal information of unlicensed individuals involved in the transfer and must be kept as part of the licensee's permanent records. Violations of specific subsections can result in fines, imprisonment, or both, with harsher penalties for repeat offenses. The penalties for violating section 932 include fines, imprisonment up to 5 years for repeat offenses, registration suspension or revocation, and a civil fine of up to $10,000. The Attorney General is granted authority to inspect gun show operators' records without a warrant for compliance purposes. Additionally, reporting requirements for multiple sales at gun shows are expanded. Section 923(g)(3)(A) of the title is amended to include notice provisions under section 932(c)(2). Section 924(a)(3) is updated to increase penalties for recordkeeping violations by licensees, including fines and imprisonment for false statements or violations of certain sections. Increased penalties for violations of criminal background check requirements include fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives may hire additional personnel to inspect gun shows. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives must report to Congress biennially on firearm sales at gun shows, background check compliance, resource needs, and recommendations for improvement. This section and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment."
