    "content": "The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extensions due to constrained financial resources. Revenues from highway taxes have declined, leading to debates on passing a bill without cutting infrastructure spending or raising the gas tax. The ongoing debate revolves around passing a bill for surface transportation programs without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved due to forecasted revenues. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years, while the House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, which is a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion. The bill includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing funding for mass transit with Highway Trust Fund revenues. The House also passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The Senate agreed to an amendment that replaced House-passed language with MAP-21 in H.R. 4348, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations will involve the substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committees' involvement. The highway trust fund is funded by various sources, including sales taxes. The highway trust fund is financed from various sources including sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, and trailers, as well as truck usage taxes. However, the majority of revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels. The fund consists of two accounts - highway and mass transit, with specific allocations from fuel taxes. Due to stagnant fuel tax rates since 1993 and factors like economic performance and fuel efficiency improvements, revenues have fallen below projections, requiring transfers from the general fund. The highway trust fund has required transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion to pay states for completed work. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall of $4.6 billion in the Highway account by the end of FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall into a $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, deepening rapidly thereafter. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund taxation system will face challenges. The Federal-Aid Highway Program faces funding challenges without an increase in fuel taxes. State DOTs primarily manage the program, with federal guidelines to follow. Projects require state/local matching shares, typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) manages the Highway Program, which requires state and local governments to provide a designated matching share for road projects. Funds are distributed through apportionment and allocation, with reimbursement occurring after project approval. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation. The FHWA legally commits the federal government to reimburse states for project costs through obligation of contract authority, even without an appropriation. The ObLim sets a limit on annual FHWA spending, similar to an appropriation, with formula and discretionary programs distributing funds to state DOTs for project spending. The majority of federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through core formula-driven programs, providing funding for projects like Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, Surface Transportation, Highway Bridge, Congestion Mitigation, Air Quality Improvement, and Highway Safety Improvement. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP, and some funding can be used for transit projects. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas, diluting the policy rationales of core program formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs, controlled by FHWA, allocate funds through competition. During SAFETEA, most funding was earmarked by Congress. The federal transit program under SAFETEA consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. Four main programs account for 85% of authorized transit funding, with two programs distributing funds by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, providing funding to urban areas with populations over 50,000, accounts for 41% of authorized transit funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA provides funding for urban areas with populations over 50,000, covering expenses for capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations up to 200,000 population. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly for replacing and rehabilitating transit rail system assets. New Starts Program offers competitive funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including busways, ferries, and vintage trolleys. Small Starts program funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. The Small Starts program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment, while other smaller funding programs account for the remaining transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States, with states primarily responsible for highway safety. Highway safety in the United States is primarily the responsibility of states, with federal programs established to assist in improving safety. Three DOT agencies administer these programs, focusing on driver behavior, vehicle safety, commercial driver qualifications, commercial vehicle safety, and roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and oversees the use of federal grant funds by requiring states to submit highway safety plans for approval. Each state's plan must identify primary safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. NHTSA provides federal traffic safety funds to states through various grant programs to address primary safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. FMCSA promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and grant programs to ensure truck and motor carrier safety. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) is a federal-aid highway funding program aimed at reducing traffic fatalities and injuries by improving roadways. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to ensure minimum annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects. SAFETEA established budget categories (\"fire walls\") to protect highway and mass transit funds from being used elsewhere. It guaranteed annual funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009 and prevented lower funding levels. The Budget Enforcement Act's firewalls ended in 2002, but were honored during SAFETEA. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on actual receipts, potentially leading to increased or decreased funding. Despite fluctuations in annual highway account receipts, Congress has never reduced spending based on RABA calculations. Recent years have seen revenues below guarantee levels, but funding cuts have been avoided due to general fund transfers. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration if a spending agreement is not reached, but exemptions likely prevent this. Consideration for aligning spending with receipts may still be on the table for reauthorization. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget Act likely prevent significant reductions in surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Programs exempted from sequestration include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety, Transit Formula Grants, and Bus Grants. The New Starts program and $739 million in annual contract authority may be subject to sequester. SAFETEA expired in 2009, with surface transportation programs operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II is an extension of the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate replaced it with MAP-21, leading to a conference between the two chambers. Negotiations may include provisions from H.R. 7, with the expectation that new proposals will fall within the scope of differences between the House and Senate versions. The House-passed STEA-II extends HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. Provisions from H.R. 7 may be proposed in conference, with rules for waiving points of order in both chambers. STEA-II includes unrelated provisions like the North American Energy Access Act and the transfer of permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. Title II of the House-passed bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The fund will be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with revenues distributed to Gulf Coast states, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and research. Unlike a previous bill, a future act of Congress is required to initiate this revenue distribution. The House-passed H.R. 4348 establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, funded by Deepwater Horizon penalties. Revenue distribution requires a future act of Congress. Title V includes the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI aims to expedite transportation project delivery and reduce highway programs. Both House and Senate bills focus on programmatic reauthorization and regulatory changes, free of earmarks. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs. It eliminates formula factors under individual programs and apportions funds based on states' shares of total apportionments and allocations from FY2005-FY2009. The bill authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013 for the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with an additional $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. The MAP-21 bill changes the programmatic structure of surface transportation, reducing federal and congressional influence on project selection. It eliminates program formulas and earmarking, shifting towards federal planning and performance management. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of apportionment. The number of programs is reduced by two-thirds, with discretionary grant programs under FHWA control being eliminated. The Transportation Enhancements Program is merged into the CMAQ program, allowing states to spend funds on non-TE CMAQ projects starting in FY2013. The bill merges the Transportation Enhancements Program into the CMAQ program, allowing states to spend funds on non-TE CMAQ projects starting in FY2013. The National Freight Program aims to increase funding for freight projects by eliminating competition with non-freight projects. The Senate bill significantly increases funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill with modest increases for federal-aid highways and funding for research and education. The bill proposes significant changes to transportation funding, including folding existing programs into new ones, reducing the number of programs by two-thirds, and redirecting fuel taxes to different accounts. It also includes provisions to streamline requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act for highway and transit projects. The House bill proposes changes to transportation funding, including exempting highway and transit projects under $10 million from NEPA, increasing TIFIA funding, and allocating funds for transit programs. It also introduces the State of Good Repair program, eliminates the Bus and Bus Facilities program, and modifies the New Starts process. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transportation funding, including renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redistributing motor fuel taxes. It eliminates certain programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. The bill also includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control for freight rail. The bill proposes changes to transportation funding, including renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redistributing motor fuel taxes. It eliminates certain programs and combines others into a single program. The bill also includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, positive train control for freight rail, and amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIF) for freight and passenger railroads. The HTF will receive $9.279 billion in transfers over fiscal years, including funds from various sources such as the LUST trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, Medicare provider payments, import tariffs on automotive products, tax treatment of securities, IRS levy on Thrift Savings Account, transfers of excess pension assets, and amendments to retiree health accounts. The savings account will receive $363 million from the extension for transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts and allowing Section 420 of the U.S. tax code to apply to life insurance benefits. Additionally, $9.467 billion will come from pension funding stabilization over 10 years, $4.970 billion will be transferred from the Treasury general fund to the HTF, and $459 million will be generated from federal agencies offering phased retirement. Other sources of revenue include the reporting of the sale of life insurance policies to third parties, extending taxes on cigarette manufacturers, delaying the use of worldwide interest expense allocation, and authorizing special measures against foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions hindering enforcement of regulations against money. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception and tax preferences for bonds issued before January 1, 2013. Additionally, savings were generated from extending employer-provided benefits and incorporating the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate bill includes provisions for employer-provided vanpool and transit pass benefits, exclusion for employer-provided parking, and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. It also authorizes states to issue TRIP bonds for transportation projects and modifies the depreciation period for long-term highway leases. The bill aims to make highway privatization less attractive to private-sector investors. The Finance Committee is concerned about the short amortization period for toll collection rights compared to lease terms. A \"solvency account\" would be established to transfer excess funds to the highway and mass transit accounts. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund for highway funding. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. It receives revenues from a fuel excise tax and supports environmental investigation and cleanup programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded its use for UST leak prevention and detection programs. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, receives revenues from a fuel excise tax to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Of the 501,000 reported releases, 85% have been addressed, leaving 88,000 requiring cleanup. The fund had a $3.392 billion balance in FY2012, with estimated interest and tax receipts. Congress typically appropriates $113 million annually, with states receiving 80% as grants. Section 40301 of a Senate bill would transfer $3.0 billion from the fund. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. It also includes provisions to appropriate one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts to the highway trust fund, totaling $3.685 billion over ten years. Additionally, the bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013, and reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. H.R. 7 includes provisions to extend highway taxes through FY2018 and reconfigure the highway trust fund. The bill aims to fill gaps with revenue increases or offsets, including $40 billion from the general fund for an alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund, but extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016. H.R. 7 aimed to direct federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the Highway Trust Fund. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, allowing leasing for oil and gas resources. In FY2011, federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion. In FY2011, oil and gas revenues totaled $6.5 billion. The Land and Water Conservation Fund receives $900 million annually, and the National Historic Preservation Fund receives $150 million annually. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time $40 billion appropriation. The bill also transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and includes provisions for offsetting revenues. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with funding provided to the alternative transportation account. The bill eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and includes a provision for highway spending controls to ensure the solvency of the highway account. Highway program earmarks are not included in MAP-21. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will adjust distribution to states to prevent a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). A ratchet mechanism will reduce funding if necessary, aiming to keep spending within HTF means. Resistance in Congress is expected due to past negative funding adjustments. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with funding from the Highway Trust Fund. The bill includes obligation limitations for FY2013-FY2016 and a proposed Alternative Transportation Account. It also features a modified Equity Bonus Program ensuring each state receives at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF. The Bonus Program in H.R. 7 guarantees that each state will receive at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the Highway Trust Fund. The program is capped at $3.9 billion per year and funds various highway programs. The House bill also allows for expanded tolling of the Interstate system, with restrictions on adding toll lanes while maintaining the same number of free lanes. Unlike previous authorization acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments without setting specific authorization levels for core programs. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and adjusted to ensure a minimum of 95% of estimated tax payments. CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding are also set aside for each state. The new CMAQ program receives a set-aside amount from state apportionments, with the metropolitan planning amount determined based on a state's apportionment ratio. The remaining initial amount is divided among core programs, with adjustments based on privatized highway usage. The provision applies to privatized toll roads, reducing apportionments for states with privatized lanes and reallocating funds to other states. FHWA estimates reductions for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, with increases for all other states. This adjustment results in a 0.087% reduction for Illinois, 4.375% for Indiana, and 0.045% for Colorado, while other states see a 0.115% increase in apportionments. The Equity Bonus Program under SAFETEA resolves concerns about federal highway spending proportionate to taxes paid by each state's highway users. MAP-21 does not have an overt equity program but determines an \"initial amount\" for each state based on funding from FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. An adjustment mechanism ensures states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF, with a nationwide rate of return at $1.23 on the dollar. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be needed to guarantee a 95% return. Some states may prefer using state return on payments to the HTF to determine the \"initial amount.\" Some states may prefer using state return on payments to the HTF to determine the \"initial amount\" for highway funding, rather than the state share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding, due to legacy earmarking issues. SAFETEA had a high number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% being \"below the line\" earmarks that did not bring additional funds to states. The remaining 33% of earmarks were \"above the line\" and increased funds to receiving states. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks but still calculates state apportionments based on SAFETEA funding shares. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks and reduced the number of funding programs by two-thirds. The apportionment calculation is based on states' share of both apportioned and allocated funding for SAFETEA years. States that did well in terms of \"above the line\" earmarks under SAFETEA would receive apportionment shares under MAP-21 reflecting these increased amounts. The core programs under MAP-21, including metropolitan transportation planning, would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP program, authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013, is the largest within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program. It aims to improve the National Highway System through various projects such as infrastructure improvements, bridge construction, and environmental initiatives. The program combines three core programs from SAFETEA to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure condition, safety, and mobility. The NHPP program focuses on improving the National Highway System through infrastructure projects, bridge construction, and environmental initiatives. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The program replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, with changes to the Transportation Enhancement program. The Transportation Enhancement program (TE) shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program, maintaining TMP eligibility for TE type projects. TMP funds, authorized at roughly $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, can be used for various transportation projects including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. States can also use TMP funds for natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to transportation projects under Title 23 U.S.C. Additionally, TMP funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with high federal vehicle traffic. Under the Transportation Modernization and Preservation (TMP) program, funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with high federal vehicle traffic. States may face penalties if deficient bridge deck area increases. TMP funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution in different areas. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in spending. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program would absorb eligibilities of discontinued programs and receive roughly $3.3 billion annually under MAP-21. Under MAP-21, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program would receive $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) would remain largely unchanged, funded at $2.5 billion annually. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished, with their project eligibilities retained. A new National Freight Program (NFP) would be established with $2 billion in annual funding to improve the national freight network. The National Freight Program (NFP) would receive roughly $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013 to enhance the national freight network. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs, with some exceptions. H.R. 7 proposes to consolidate or eliminate certain programs while expanding the National Highway System Program (NHS) and the Surface Transportation Program (STP). The Highway Bridge Program would be included in the National Highway System Program under H.R. 7. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the NHS Program, while the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated. Obligation limitations for core highway programs total $150.7 billion for FY2013-FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the CMAQ Program. H.R. 7 expands funding for the NHS program to cover maintenance, repair of the Interstate Highway system, and bridge construction. Under H.R. 7, the National Highway System Program would encompass the Highway Bridge Program and Interstate Maintenance Program. Funding for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would be authorized at $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014, with a broader scope including bridge and tunnel projects. The requirement for a 10% set-aside for transportation enhancements would be eliminated. Additionally, projects on local or rural minor roads would be prohibited. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Program (STP) funding, including setting aside 10% for transportation enhancements. It allows up to 15% of funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on minor collector roads. The bill also reduces the required spending percentage on urbanized areas over 200,000 population. States must consult with local planning organizations for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. Additionally, $10.4 billion would be provided for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for FY2013-FY2014, with states required to have their own safety programs and plans. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Program (STP) funding, including setting aside 10% for transportation enhancements and ensuring each state receives a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with $8 billion allocated to the proposed alternative transportation account for CMAQ. The bill aims to improve road safety by identifying the 100 most dangerous roads in each state and evaluating progress annually. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds for roads and bridges damaged by disasters. It limits U.S. territories to $20 million per year and removes the $100 million ceiling for disasters in a single state. It allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period and 100% federal share for repairs exceeding state apportionments. H.R. 7 defines \"comparable facility.\" The Secretary of Transportation has discretion to allow repairs exceeding state apportionments under H.R. 7. \"Comparable facility\" is defined as meeting current standards for traffic volume. Debris removal costs are reimbursed if not covered by the Stafford Act. U.S. territories are limited to $20 million annually. Emergency declaration is required for assistance, with states providing project lists within two years. ER funding is extended to federal lands highways and tribal roads. The Senate bill restructures Federal Lands Highways Programs. The Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, established under MAP-21, includes the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. The Tribal Transportation Program is funded at $450 million annually, with a new formula for fund distribution based on road mileage and tribal population. The Federal Lands Access Program allocates funds to states based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually and the Federal Lands Transportation Program at $535 million annually. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% per year set-aside, or $135 million annually, with specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually. The Senate bill eliminates the ADHS program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 would raise the federal share payable for the cost of constructing highways and access roads on the Appalachian. H.R. 7 would retain the Transportation Mobility Program at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016, allowing states to use toll credits for the local matching share. Funds would be apportioned based on cost estimates, with no state receiving less than 1% or more than 25%. The Senate bill establishes a $1 billion discretionary program for high-cost infrastructure projects to enhance economic competitiveness. Surface transportation infrastructure projects difficult to complete with existing funding would generate national economic benefits, improve global competitiveness, reduce congestion, enhance energy security, and transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on project selection process within three years. H.R. 7 repeals SAFETEA PNRS provision. Senate bill creates general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities, distributing funds based on passengers, vehicles, and total system data. The MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for fiscal years FY2012 and FY2013 for ferry systems. Funds would require an appropriation to be made available. Ferry boats and facilities eligible for formula funds under the National Highway Performance Program. H.R. 7 proposes funding the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million for FY2013-FY2016. Distribution of funds based on vehicles and passengers carried by ferry systems. The MAP-21 authorizes funding for ferry systems based on vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles serviced. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for transportation projects, with proposed changes to greatly enlarge the program. The MAP-21 bill proposes to significantly expand the TIFIA program by authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, up from $122 million in SAFETEA. This would allow for loans totaling $9.9 billion per year with an increased share of project costs covered by TIFIA. Additionally, credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement,\" rather than on a project-by-project basis. The MAP-21 bill proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including lowering the threshold for rural infrastructure projects to $25 million and offering loans at half the Treasury rate. 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for rural projects, which will be evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis once the funding is exhausted for the year. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, authorizes $1 billion annually for the TIFIA program from the highway trust fund. It allows for the payment of credit subsidies from federal surface transportation apportionments and establishes master credit agreements for related projects. The bill eliminates evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance, providing assistance on a first-come, first-served basis for eligible projects. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million, and the thresholds for non-ITS and ITS projects remain at $50 million and $15 million, respectively. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including maintaining the $50 million threshold for non-ITS projects and $15 million for ITS projects. It adds a $25 million threshold for rural projects and a $1 billion threshold for assistance under a master credit agreement. The bill also increases federal assistance to 49% and authorizes $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with funding mainly provided through regular highway programs. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose changes to funding for freight transportation improvements. MAP-21 creates a dedicated funding program for freight transport, while H.R. 7 includes provisions that impact freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan in consultation with stakeholders. Additionally, they aim to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose changes to funding for freight transportation improvements, including provisions to increase private-sector participation. MAP-21 introduces a new core program to direct funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement, creating a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles. States would allocate funds to the PFN first before other freight-related infrastructure, with the potential for additional miles to be designated based on future importance. The PFN would be re-designated every decade. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose changes to funding for freight transportation improvements, including provisions to increase private-sector participation.

States would allocate funds to the PFN first before other freight-related infrastructure, with the potential for additional miles to be designated based on future importance. The PFN would be re-designated every decade. States could designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated to these roads. The national freight network (NFM) includes critical rural freight corridors, portions of the Interstate System not designated as the PFN, and the PFN. States could also spend funds on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows cost-effectively. Up to 10% of funds could be used for freight rail or maritime projects if they significantly improve freight flow and the public benefit exceeds the federal cost. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose changes to funding for freight transportation improvements, including provisions to increase private-sector participation.

Up to 10% of funds could be used for freight rail or maritime projects if they significantly improve freight flow and the public benefit exceeds the federal cost. The freight program would rely on apportioned funds, and states could still be reluctant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks. The House bill under H.R. 7 focuses on funding for freight transport by reallocating funds from programs not relevant to shippers. It also aims to increase reliance on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The bill does not alter truck size and weight limits but requires a study on possible changes. Additionally, it seeks to terminate the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund, potentially benefiting roadway maintenance and construction for truck transportation. H.R. 7 did not increase truck weight limits but allowed for a study on the issue. It did increase the length of double trailers for LTL carriers and trailers for truckload carriers. The bill also included a pilot program for increased truck weights on certain Interstate Highway segments. Idle reduction equipment weight exemption was raised. For freight provisions related to rail and maritime modes, refer to specific sections in the report. MAP-21 would bring significant changes. MAP-21 proposes substantial changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the use of performance management throughout the planning process. State and metropolitan planning would need to include performance measures and targets, with consequences for failing to meet targets being relatively mild. At the national level, a national freight strategic plan would be required to establish quantifiable performance measures. The MAP-21 program requires the development of a national freight strategic plan by the Department of Transportation, including establishing performance measures for freight movement. States must set performance targets for freight movement and submit improvement plans if targets are not met. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act also includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan. Section 1203 aims to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries on public roads, while Section 33002 targets a 50% reduction in motor vehicle-related fatalities by 2030. Conflicting provisions include Section 1115 calling for a national freight plan within three years and Section 33003 calling for a transportation and freight performance plan within two years. States under the National Highway Performance Program must develop asset management plans with performance targets. The Secretary must set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS. MAP-21 sets minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS. States may need to redirect federal funds if conditions fall below the minimum. State planning requirements remain mostly unchanged, but now include incorporating metropolitan and nonmetropolitan transportation plans. Performance-based approaches are required in transportation planning, with coordination of performance measures and targets across planning efforts. MAP-21 proposes a performance-based approach in transportation planning, including coordination of performance measures with other planning efforts. It introduces two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with different technical requirements. Tier I MPOs will have to meet performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II MPOs will have more discretion. Optional blueprint planning scenarios are also included in MAP-21. MAP-21 introduces two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I and Tier II MPOs allowed to select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states. The legislation proposes to require MPO designation only in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more, with the option for smaller areas to be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population would need reaffirmation to continue operating. The intent of MAP-21 is to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and statewide and metropolitan transportation planning. It mandates the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation (DOT) with input from states, updated every two years. H.R. 7 also requires a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highways and public transportation, including state performance measures and targets. States would need to comply with reporting requirements. H.R. 7 mandates national performance measures and targets, state performance measurement systems, and reporting requirements for transportation planning. It includes provisions for identifying projects of national significance, addressing congestion at airports and freight rail corridors, and considering intercity buses in reducing congestion and pollution. Regional transportation planning organizations would have a role in project selection, and the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation would be increased. H.R. 7 proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation from 50,000 to 100,000. Existing MPOs under 100,000 can continue unless the governor and localities agree to terminate. The bill also emphasizes considering intercity buses in metropolitan planning and aims to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about using transportation resources effectively. The environmental review process for highway and transit projects involves preparing documentation to identify and address project-related impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is necessary, which may include obtaining permits and mitigating effects on historic sites or parks. The NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before proceeding with proposed actions for federal-aid highway or transit projects. Approval of NEPA documentation by FHWA or FTA is necessary before final design activities or project construction can begin. DOT policy mandates coordination of all environmental investigations and compliance with applicable requirements in the NEPA document. The distinction between NEPA requirements and those identified during the compliance process may impact project delays and solutions for expediting them. The distinction between NEPA requirements and compliance process may impact project delays and solutions for expediting them. Recent legislative efforts aim to expedite environmental reviews for highway and transit projects by focusing on NEPA compliance. Proposed changes in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 extend beyond NEPA, with the House proposal involving more sweeping changes. These provisions intend to expedite project delivery by altering environmental compliance requirements, but the impact on accelerating reviews and project delivery remains complex. The environmental review process in transportation project development involves identifying and documenting compliance requirements under NEPA. FHWA or FTA must ensure completion of this process before project activities can proceed. Projects with unclear environmental impacts require an environmental assessment to determine significance. The environmental review process in transportation project development involves identifying and documenting compliance requirements under NEPA. Projects with unclear environmental impacts require an environmental assessment (EA) to determine significance. Projects with no significant environmental impacts may be categorically excluded (CEs) from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA. Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA were processed as CEs, while 6% required an EA. These projects may still be subject to other environmental requirements under various laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process in MAP-21 are established under Section 1313, \"Accelerated Decisionmaking,\" and Section 1316, \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" Under Section 1313 of MAP-21, new requirements for issue resolution in the environmental review process would ensure timely project completion and dispute resolution. Financial transfer provisions would penalize agencies failing to issue required approvals, with potential weekly transfers of $10,000 or $20,000. Transfers would occur after 180 days of application completion or final project decision. The transfer provision under Section 1316 of MAP-21 would require a transfer within 180 days after an application for a permit, license, or approval is complete, or after a final project decision is made. Various agencies are responsible for issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects, such as EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in approvals may be due to agency under-staffing or lack of funds, and redirecting funds to expedite one project could slow down others. The transfer provision under Section 1316 of MAP-21 would require a transfer within 180 days after an application for a permit, license, or approval is complete, or after a final project decision is made. This expedited approval process may inadvertently slow down other applications being processed by the same office. DOT is mandated to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements before and after MAP-21's enactment, with a report due to Congress within a year. However, there is no specific funding allocated for these assessments, and tracking completion times for NEPA documents may be challenging due to lack of data availability. State DOTs do not track the time it takes to complete the NEPA process or other environmental compliance obligations. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to start tracking this information. MAP-21 provisions for CEs involve changing existing regulatory requirements and adding new projects to the list of CEs. DOT would need to survey state agencies for suggestions and promulgate regulations accordingly. The DOT would need to update CE regulations by adding new projects and moving specific projects to a list where no additional approval is required. Provisions also include specifying criteria for projects within highway right-of-ways to be designated as categorical exclusions and continuing environment-related programs established under SAFETEA. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program allows states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews, with new provisions under MAP-21 reinforcing the importance of certain activities. States must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the DOT to establish project priorities before receiving funding approval. States can use apportioned funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. Under MAP-21, provisions in the House bill aim to streamline the environmental review process for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA requirements would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. For projects still subject to NEPA, H.R. 7 proposes significant changes to the compliance process, including altering the range of project alternatives considered. H.R. 7 proposes significant changes to the NEPA compliance process for federal projects, including altering project alternatives, document formats, analysis requirements, and evaluation of cumulative impacts. It also sets specific timeframes for permits, a 270-day deadline for environmental reviews, and limits on judicial review. The bill amends requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The Senate has substituted MAP-21 language for H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House, ensuring the inclusion of H.R. 7 streamlining provisions. MAP-21, included in H.R. 4348, aims to speed up project delivery by allowing state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. This contract type combines design and construction phases, enabling early construction tasks before design completion. H.R. 7 allows contractors to begin construction tasks before design work is complete, speeding up project delivery. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods. It also creates a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" under H.R. 7 allows advance payment of moving costs for people and businesses affected by highway projects, with no limit on the number of participating states. This program aims to expedite the relocation of individuals from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. Additionally, MAP-21 proposes revisions to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) to provide funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in areas exceeding air quality standards for pollutants. NAAQS were set for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Areas meeting NAAQS are in \"attainment,\" while those not meeting standards are in \"nonattainment.\" The program focuses on nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed amendments under MAP-21 maintain program goals and eligibility criteria. Proposed amendments under MAP-21 would change how CMAQ program funding levels are established and distributed within states. Funding would be tied to previous years' amounts and distributed based on new program limitations and suballocations. The CMAQ program funding under MAP-21 would be distributed within states based on specific limitations and suballocations. States would need to reserve a portion of funds for certain projects like transportation enhancements and recreational trails. The remaining funds would be suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with distribution based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Under MAP-21, CMAQ program funding distribution within states is subject to specific limitations and suballocations. Half of the suballocated funds must be obligated based on population in nonattainment or maintenance areas for fine particulates. Additionally, 30% of the funds must be set aside for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. The remaining CMAQ funds apportioned to a state can be used for eligible projects in any nonattainment or maintenance areas. Proposed provisions in MAP-21 aim to prioritize projects reducing pollutants in nonattainment areas, including diesel retrofits, and require the development of a cost-effectiveness table for projects evaluation. Proposed Section 149(h) and (i) of H.R. 7 require the development of a cost-effectiveness table for projects evaluation. MPOs would consider this information in performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. Optional programmatic eligibility allows for technical assessments to demonstrate emissions reductions. Section 149(k) mandates MPOs to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. House bill provisions would amend project eligibility requirements under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7149(b) to promote alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles include tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production. Non-tax incentives include automaker credits under the CAFE program. Various highway programs offer incentives like permitting low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. Legislation like H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend these incentives, but also impose limits on exemptions if HOV lanes become congested. The House and Senate bills aim to address vehicle speed issues during peak travel hours and support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure. They propose using highway funds for new charging stations and amending the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include more types of clean fuel buses and facilities. The Senate's public transit provisions are included in Division B of the legislation. The Senate's public transit provisions in the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account and the general fund. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. The bill also eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers $40 billion from the general fund into the alternative transportation account. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 proposes significant changes to the federal transit program. It includes the creation of a State of Good Repair Grant Program to replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. This new program consists of a High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding for these programs would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 proposes significant changes to the federal transit program, including the creation of State of Good Repair Grant Programs for fixed guideway systems. Funding for these programs would come from the mass transit account and the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old, using a formula based on vehicle miles and route miles. Funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would be set aside from the New Starts program. The discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program would be eliminated, with some of its funding added to other formula programs. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 proposes significant changes to the federal transit program, including combining certain formula grant programs and creating new programs like the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. The Access to Jobs program would require recipients to allocate a portion of their funding to help low-income individuals travel to and from work. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 proposes a new Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, similar to the Highway Emergency Relief Program, to provide funding for disasters. It doubles the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually. The bill also eliminates some programs and combines others, maintaining the current structure of the federal transit program. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program, including distributing funding by formula instead of earmarking. It incentivizes contracting out bus services and allows private operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make significant changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for investments in existing fixed guideway systems. The Senate bill proposes significant changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for investments in existing fixed guideway systems to improve capacity and functionality. It simplifies the process by reducing major stages from four to three and eliminates the separate alternatives analysis required by law. Project sponsors must apply to the Secretary of Transportation and initiate the NEPA process to enter the project development phase. The Senate bill proposes changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for existing fixed guideway systems. It simplifies the process, reducing stages and eliminating separate alternatives analysis. Project sponsors must apply to the Secretary of Transportation and initiate the NEPA process to enter project development. The bill aims to advance projects quickly using special warrants for projects with federal share of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program and create a pilot program for expedited project delivery. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to the New Starts program, allocating $150 million for Small Starts projects and eliminating the alternatives analysis. It includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for certain projects like new urban circulator service. The bill also adjusts project justification criteria. H.R. 7 proposes changes to project justification criteria for transportation projects, including adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as evaluation factors. It also allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use up to 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. Additionally, funds can be used for operating expenses in urbanized areas with high unemployment rates for up to three years. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes allowing transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses operated in peak service. The cost share would vary depending on the number of buses, with a maximum of 50% federal funding for systems operating 75 buses or fewer. Additionally, the bill would increase the share of formula funds that can be used for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. H.R. 7 proposes increasing the share of urbanized and nonurbanized formula funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15%. It also calls for the development of a national rail plan for passenger and freight rail, as well as regional and state rail plans. States may create state rail plans to refine regional plans for federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission. The bill proposes amendments to the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor. It also mandates the development of guidance for measuring train delays, conducting a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and surveying track access arrangements. Additionally, it aims to establish an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services controlled by Amtrak and states funding corridor services. The bill proposes creating an entity controlled by Amtrak and states to manage standardized cars for corridor services. It aims to achieve economies of scale but may discourage innovation in car design. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design regulations. H.R. 7 proposes changes to rail programs, including repealing the congestion grant program and reducing funding for Amtrak. It also addresses food and beverage service regulations on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 proposes changes to Amtrak's food and beverage service regulations, repealing the self-supporting requirement and allowing for competitive bidding. It also includes amendments to federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines and expanding the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing state or local subsidies as collateral and expanding eligible uses of loans. It also suggests modifications to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) laws, including raising the ceiling on freight charge cases and imposing shorter procedural deadlines. Additionally, the STB would study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual revenue adequacy examination. The bill H.R. 7 proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, requiring the STB to report railroad service complaints and review staffing needs. It would also repeal a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads and facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. The bill mandates positive train control (PTC) for passenger and freight railroads on routes carrying toxic-by-inhalation products to prevent accidents. Railroads have raised concerns about the high cost of implementing PTC. The Senate bill proposes extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, allowing for extensions until December 31, 2018. It also makes PTC implementation eligible for RRIF funding and requires a joint DOT/FCC study on spectrum needs for PTC. In contrast, the House bill (H.R. 7) extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals, offering railroads the option of implementing equivalent safety measures. Highway safety programs fall under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Senate bill proposes new NHTSA grant programs, including incentives for states to enforce texting while driving laws and increase civil penalties for safety violations. It also mandates event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting in 2015. In contrast, the House bill consolidates existing grant programs into one with reduced funding and prohibits federal funding for motorcycle helmet usage studies. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. The Senate bill proposes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills aim to prevent drug and alcohol test result evasion by commercial drivers and strengthen oversight on \"reincarnated carriers.\" Additionally, they provide similar funding levels for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. The transit safety section in MAP-21 addresses concerns raised by fatal rail transit incidents in 2009 and 2010. The proposed legislation in MAP-21 aims to establish safety standards for rail transit systems, create a safety certification program, ensure financial independence of state safety oversight agencies, and provide grants to states for oversight. H.R. 7 does not authorize setting safety standards but allows for federal funds to be allocated for safety and state of good repair projects before other transit projects. The proposed legislation in MAP-21 and H.R. 7 focuses on safety and state of good repair projects for transit agencies. Both bills authorize funding for transportation research and education, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. Additionally, MAP-21 includes grants for university transportation centers. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize grants for university transportation centers for research. They also address the issue of fully spending revenues from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on waterside infrastructure maintenance. H.R. 4348 includes a provision to match budgetary resources with fund receipts for harbor maintenance programs."
