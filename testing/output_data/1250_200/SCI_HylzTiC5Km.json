It addresses challenges in encoding vast context and preserving global coherence and detail exactness. SPN generates images as a sequence of slices, capturing spatial dependencies efficiently. Multidimensional upscaling is used to grow images in size and depth. SPNs achieve state-of-the-art likelihood results in generating CelebAHQ and ImageNet images. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) proposes a conditional decoder architecture for generating high fidelity images. It achieves state-of-the-art likelihood results in generating CelebAHQ and ImageNet images, setting new benchmarks in various settings. Autoregressive models trained with maximum likelihood estimation have excelled in generating high-fidelity samples across various domains like text, audio, images, and videos. However, in large-scale image generation, these models struggle to exhibit long-range structure and semantic coherence. The relationship between model likelihood scores and sample fidelity poses challenges in achieving high-quality image generation. Autoregressive models trained with maximum likelihood estimation excel in generating high-fidelity samples but struggle with long-range structure and semantic coherence in large-scale image generation. Challenges arise from the relationship between model likelihood scores and sample fidelity, as well as the high dimensionality of large images requiring significant memory and computation. Multidimensional upscaling techniques are used to map subimages to target resolutions, emphasizing the need for architectural connections and sufficient capacity to learn dependencies among image positions. The text discusses the challenges of generating high-fidelity 8-bit RGB images using autoregressive models. Multidimensional upscaling techniques are employed to map subimages to target resolutions, focusing on visually salient subsets of the distribution. The goal is to guide the model to prioritize important bits of the distribution for better sample fidelity. The text discusses generating high-fidelity 8-bit RGB images using autoregressive models. It employs multidimensional upscaling techniques to map subimages to target resolutions, focusing on visually salient subsets of the distribution. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture addresses training difficulties of decoders for size and depth upscaling. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) is an image decoder that generates slices based on previously generated slices, utilizing a conditioning network and a decoder. It can be used for implicit or explicit size upscaling and has shown state-of-the-art results on image generation benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) has shown strong benefits in multidimensional upscaling and sample fidelity on benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet. It produces high-quality samples at full 8-bit resolution, setting a fidelity baseline for future methods. Additionally, the SPN and multidimensional upscaling have a striking impact on sample quality, as seen in successful samples on unconditional ImageNet-128. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) utilizes an alternative ordering for image processing, dividing large images into slices to encode long-range dependencies efficiently. This ordering allows for consistent application of the same decoder to all slices, enabling the use of self-attention in the SPN without local contexts. It is considered the two-dimensional analogue of the one-dimensional subscale ordering. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) uses a unique ordering method for image processing, dividing images into slices to encode dependencies efficiently. A scaling factor is selected to obtain interleaved slices, each specified by row and column offsets. Size upscaling can be performed explicitly by training a single slice decoder on subimages. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) uses a unique ordering method for image processing, dividing images into slices to encode dependencies efficiently. The SPN can act as a full-blown image model and a size upscaling model simultaneously. Multidimensional upscaling applies upscaling not just in the height and width of the image, but also in the channel depth. This is done in stages where each network generates bits of the image conditioned on the previous bits. The depth upscaling process in the Subscale Pixel Network involves generating significant bits of the image in stages, with each network generating bits conditioned on previous bits. Weight sharing is not done between networks at different stages. The goal is to focus on visually salient bits of an image while ignoring less salient and predictable bits. This method is related to Grayscale PixelCNN and aims to efficiently represent context for each pixel dimension. Existing approaches require superlinear computation and memory. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses challenges in encoding dependencies among pixels in large images. Existing AR approaches have superlinear computation and memory requirements, limiting scalability. SPN uses a subscale ordering approach to generate image bits in stages, focusing on visually salient information while efficiently representing context for each pixel dimension. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) uses a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image, ensuring constant memory and computation requirements as image size changes. The SPN architecture consists of an embedding part for preceding slices that conditions the decoder for the current slice being generated. Empty padding slices are used to preserve relative meta-positions of each preceding slice with respect to the current target slice. The embedding architecture in the Subscale Pixel Network ensures equivariance with respect to slice positions and maintains input tensor depth. The decoder processes target slices in raster-scan order using a hybrid architecture of masked convolution and self-attention. The decoder in the hybrid architecture combines masked convolution and self-attention to process target slices in raster-scan order. It employs 1D self-attention to gather context, followed by masked 1D self-attention layers and a Gated PixelCNN for conditioning input. This structure allows for lower memory requirements and captures the entire context at each position of the decoder. The log-likelihood is derived as a sum over slices.

It employs 1D self-attention to gather context and a Gated PixelCNN for conditioning input. The log-likelihood is derived as a sum over slices, and maximum likelihood learning is done through stochastic gradient descent on a Monte Carlo estimate. The SPN serves as a size-upscaling network and can also be used to upscale the depth of image channels. The curr_chunk discusses the development of a model capable of generating high-fidelity samples at high resolution, outperforming existing models like Glow. The model demonstrates superior performance on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets, achieving state-of-the-art log-likelihoods at 128x128 resolution and setting a benchmark at 256x256 resolution. The network operates on small images and can train large networks with multiple hidden units and network depth. The context-embedding network has 5 convolutional layers and 6-8 self-attention layers. The masked decoder consists of a PixelCNN with 15 layers. The 1D Transformer in the decoder has 8-10 layers. The hybrid decoder performs well on 32x32 and 64x64 Downsampled ImageNet datasets. SPN hurts performance in low-resolution settings but achieves state-of-the-art log-likelihood on 64x64 Downsampled ImageNet. SPN achieves significant improvement in log-likelihood over existing models on 128x128 ImageNet, with samples showing semantic coherence and increased success rates with multidimensional upscaling. High-fidelity samples of celebrity faces can be produced at 256x256 resolution from the CelebAHQ dataset. The SPN model achieves state-of-the-art MLE scores on large-scale images like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet-128. It can generate high-fidelity 8-bit samples without altering the sampling process. The quality of samples compares favorably to other models like Glow and GANs BID6. The generated samples from the SPN model show high semantic coherence and exactness of details in full 8-bit 128 \u00d7 128 and 256 \u00d7 256 images. The entropy of the softmax output distributions can be adjusted using a \"temperature\" divisor on the predicted logits. Large batch sizes are achieved through data parallelism on Google Cloud TPU pods, with 64 tensorcores used for Imagenet 32 and 128 tensorcores for ImageNet 64, 128, and 256. The SPN model utilizes different numbers of tensorcores for various datasets, with architectures containing between \u223c50M and \u223c250M parameters. For CelebA-HQ, batch size is decreased to 32 tensorcores to combat overfitting. The multidimensional upscaling setting for ImageNet 128 has the highest parameter count of \u223c650M."
