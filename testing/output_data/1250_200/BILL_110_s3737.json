    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008\" and includes a Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program. The section defines terms like \"automobile\", \"fuel\", \"manufacturer\", and \"passenger automobile\" according to title 49, United States Code. An \"eligible individual\" is someone with no more than 3 registered passenger automobiles, who filed a federal income tax return in 2007, is not eligible for a deduction under section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code, and has a certain adjusted gross income. An eligible individual for the Program must have an adjusted gross income not exceeding $25,000 ($40,000 for joint filers or heads of household), not acquired an automobile under the Program, and not filed jointly with someone who acquired a car. An eligible new automobile is a passenger car that has never been registered and is manufactured by a qualifying manufacturer. The Program requires eligible individuals to have an adjusted gross income below $25,000 ($40,000 for joint filers or heads of household) and not have acquired a car under the Program. The eligible new car must be manufactured by a qualifying manufacturer with operations in the US, assembled in the US, and have a fuel economy of at least 25 miles per gallon. The Program requires individuals with a low income and no previous Program car acquisition to purchase a new car from a US manufacturer with a fuel economy of at least 25 miles per gallon. The new car must have a fuel economy more than 4.9 miles per gallon greater than the old car being traded in. The term \"eligible old automobile\" refers to a passenger car that is operable, was first registered at least 10 years before the trade-in date, is registered under the individual's name initiating the trade, and was registered under their name before December 1, 2008. The Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program provides subsidies for eligible individuals to purchase new cars in exchange for old ones. The Program, established by the Secretary of the Treasury, defines fuel economy as the average miles traveled per gallon of gasoline. It will run from the date of regulation until December 31, 2009. Eligible old automobiles must be operable, registered under the individual's name, and registered before December 1, 2008. The Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program, established by the Secretary of the Treasury, provides subsidies for eligible individuals to trade in their old cars for new ones. The program will run until December 31, 2009, with regulations set by the Secretary. If an eligible individual trades in their old car for a new one, the Secretary will provide $10,000 to the seller of the new car. There are limitations on the purchase price of the new car, and compensation will be provided for delayed payments. An eligible individual can initiate a trade under the Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program by driving their old car to the seller, providing the old car and paying the difference between the purchase price of the new car and the amount provided by the Secretary. The trade must be notified to the Secretary in a timely manner. The Secretary must be notified of the trade between an eligible individual and a seller. The seller must dispose of the old automobile properly, and the Secretary will compensate them for the costs. Regulations for the Program will be prescribed by the Secretary within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Chapter 5 of Title 5, United States Code, does not apply to regulations under paragraph (1). Direct spending authority is granted to the Secretary for the Program, with appropriations designated as emergency requirements for fiscal years 2008 and 2009."
