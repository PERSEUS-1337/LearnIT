    "content": "The United States is a global leader in genetic technologies for crops and livestock. GE foods, like the Flavr Savr tomato, were first approved in 1994. Today, 90% of certain crop acres are planted with GE varieties. Congress passed the 2016 Act, requiring the disclosure of GE foods to consumers. The 2016 Act in the United States requires the disclosure of genetically engineered (GE) foods to consumers, joining over 60 countries with similar regulations. The Standard sets a national standard for disclosing bioengineered foods and ingredients, outlining responsibilities, appearance of disclosures, and compliance deadlines. Stakeholder reactions to the final Standard have been mixed, with some organizations criticizing the rule while others supporting it. Several organizations, including the OTA, CFS, Non-GMO Project, and IATP, criticized the USDA's final GMO labeling rule for lacking transparency. In contrast, the NCGA, ASA, and FMI provided supportive comments, emphasizing the need for a consistent system to inform consumers about GMO content without stigmatizing it. The NCGA, ASA, and FMI supported the USDA's GMO labeling rule, emphasizing the need for transparency without stigmatizing GMO technology. They believe the rule allows for transparency while following Congress's intent, with food companies having the option to provide additional information. The rule provides a consistent way to inform consumers about bioengineered ingredients in grocery products. Before agriculture began over 10,000 years ago, people were already altering plants, animals, and other edible organisms through hunting and gathering. The pace of genetic changes accelerated with the onset of agriculture, leading to selective breeding to create agricultural varieties that meet farmer and consumer needs. Traditional breeding methods produced hybrid varieties with enhanced characteristics, while laboratory-based techniques since the mid-20th century have further improved the ability to modify agricultural varieties. Genetic engineering has allowed for specific genetic manipulation, creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that conventional breeding methods could not achieve in a timely manner. The federal government's Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology governs how USDA, FDA, and EPA evaluate biotechnology products. USDA regulates plants under the Plant Protection Act, while FDA regulates food, animal feed additives, and drugs. The Standard addresses food labeling and does not change how biotechnology foods are regulated for safety and approval. The FDA and EPA regulate biotechnology products, including food, animal feed additives, and drugs. The Coordinated Framework focuses on regulating products based on their characteristics rather than the processes used to develop them. FDA's policy on genetically engineered (GE) foods states that they are generally \"substantially similar\" to non-GE foods and do not require additional regulation or labeling unless they have nutritional differences. The FDA requires labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods with specific characteristics, such as nutritional differences or allergenic sources. APHIS reviews GE organisms for plant pest risks. In 2019, a proposed rule exempted certain GE plants from review based on evidence. The Standard mandates disclosure of bioengineered foods to consumers, with a compliance period and deadline provided by USDA. The USDA delegated the development and implementation of the Standard for bioengineered foods to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The Standard requires food manufacturers, importers, and retailers to make disclosures by January 1, 2022, with a voluntary compliance period starting on January 1, 2020. The estimated cost of implementation ranges from $570 million to $3.9 billion in the first year. The USDA delegated the development and implementation of the Standard for bioengineered foods to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The RIA estimates that implementation will cost between $570 million and $3.9 billion in the first year, with ongoing costs between $52 million and $118 million annually. The RIA identifies key provisions of the Standard and associated issues raised by stakeholders in three categories: applicability, disclosure, and financial benefits. The Standard for bioengineered foods, delegated to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, addresses applicability to specific foods and entities. The 2016 Act defines bioengineering in food as genetic material modified through in vitro recombinant DNA techniques. Public reactions to the Standard's provisions remain controversial. The USDA's Standard for bioengineered foods defines bioengineering as genetic material modified through in vitro recombinant DNA techniques. The Standard requires the use of the term bioengineering and sets boundaries for foods that require disclosure, excluding certain products derived from GE sources like animal feed. The Standard does not provide explicit definitions for terms like conventional breeding or foods developed through specific technologies like gene editing. The USDA's Standard for bioengineered foods excludes certain products derived from GE sources like animal feed from labeling requirements. The Standard also exempts foods with undetectable modified DNA, incidental additives, foods served in restaurants, food from very small manufacturers, foods below a certain bioengineered substance threshold, foods from animals fed bioengineered feed, and food certified under the USDA National Organic Program. The 2016 Act exempts certain foods from disclosure, including those served in restaurants or similar retail food establishments and those produced by very small food manufacturers. The Act also calls for the determination of allowable levels of bioengineered substances in food, with a tolerance for inadvertent presence of up to five percent. The 2016 Act exempts certain foods from disclosure, including those served in restaurants or similar retail food establishments and those produced by very small food manufacturers. It allows for inadvertent bioengineered presence of up to five percent in ingredients. The Standard does not consider food derived from animals consuming bioengineered feed as bioengineered food. NOP certification is sufficient to claim the absence of bioengineering in food products. NOP-certified products are produced without genetic engineering methods. The 2016 Act exempts certain foods from disclosure, including those served in restaurants or similar retail food establishments and those produced by very small food manufacturers. It allows for inadvertent bioengineered presence of up to five percent in ingredients. The final Standard includes a List of Bioengineered Foods (the List), that identifies foods available in a bioengineered form. Only bioengineered versions may require disclosure, while non-bioengineered versions are exempt. Regulated entities must determine if enzymes, yeasts, and other microorganisms produced in controlled environments require disclosure on a case-by-case basis. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) plans to update the List of Bioengineered Foods annually starting in early 2020, with opportunities for public comment. The definition of bioengineered food in the Standard remains controversial, with disagreements on terms, gene editing, treatment of refined food products, and disclosure thresholds. Some groups praise the Standard for consistency and transparency, while others advocate for stricter GE labeling. Some groups praise the Standard for consistency and transparency, while others advocate for stricter GE labeling due to concerns about permissiveness in disclosing genetically engineered foods. The terminology used in the Standard has been a point of contention, with some stakeholders suggesting alternative terms like GMO or genetically engineered for better consumer understanding. The Standard's definition of bioengineered food focuses on the products of technology rather than specific technologies used in their creation. During rulemaking, stakeholders called for the Standard to address foods derived from new genetic technologies that may not meet the statutory definition of bioengineering. The Standard's lack of specificity on technologies has led to confusion among consumers and regulated entities regarding disclosure requirements for foods derived from gene editing. Some interpret the bioengineering definition as excluding gene-edited foods, while others note the rule does not explicitly address gene editing or other new genetic technologies. The final rule on GE labeling does not explicitly address gene editing or new genetic technologies. Advocates argue that gene-edited foods should be required to bear disclosures as they meet the common understanding of genetic engineering. The Standard excludes refined food products without detectable modified DNA from disclosure requirements, such as soybean oil and refined sugar. Manufacturers can demonstrate the absence of modified genetic material through validated refining processes. Some groups advocate for a broader definition of bioengineered foods to meet consumer demand for transparency. Some groups advocate for broader GE labeling to meet consumer demand for transparency. The Standard sets a 5% threshold for disclosure of bioengineered substances in foods, which some argue is too high. The Standard sets a 5% threshold for disclosure of bioengineered substances in foods, with options for on-package disclosure to consumers. The disclosure must be prominent and clear, placed in specific locations on the label, and can include text, symbols, electronic links, or phone numbers. The final rule specifies various disclosure options for bioengineered foods, including text and symbols. The required text for disclosure includes \"Bioengineered food\" and \"Contains a bioengineered food ingredient.\" Regulated entities can use color or black-and-white versions of disclosure symbols. The disclosure symbols in Figure 1 include one for products requiring disclosure and another for products derived from bioengineering. Entities exempt from mandatory disclosure can voluntarily use the symbols. Bioengineered food can be disclosed through electronic or digital links like QR codes or digital watermarks. The link must be accompanied by the text \"Scan here for more food information.\" The 2016 Act and the Standard require electronic or digital link disclosures on packages to be accompanied by the text \"Scan here for more food information\" and a telephone number for additional information. Providing disclosure through these technologies was controversial, leading to a study by Deloitte Consulting which found that electronic links would not provide sufficient access to information for consumers. The Standard now includes disclosure by text message as an option for regulated entities, in addition to electronic and digital links. Small food manufacturers, defined as those with annual receipts between $2.5 million and $10 million, can choose to provide a telephone number or website address for consumers to access more information. Additional considerations are specified for small and very small packages, as well as food sold in bulk containers. The Standard allows for voluntary disclosure options for small and very small packages, as well as food sold in bulk containers. Retailers are responsible for disclosures for bulk containers and must use the primary disclosure options. Exempt entities can voluntarily disclose bioengineered foods using any provided options, including foods that do not require mandatory disclosure. Voluntary disclosures should indicate ingredients are \"derived from bioengineering.\" Some advocates criticize the disclosure options in the Standard as confusing and uninformative, while industry groups support them as flexible and informative. The Organic Trade Association argues that the Standard does not provide meaningful disclosure, allowing for digital/electronic disclosures instead of on-pack plain English text. The Center for Food criticizes the stylized GMO symbol as misleading and not reflecting a neutral symbol as intended by Congress. The Center for Food Safety criticized the disclosure methods in the Standard as unwieldy and inhibiting access to GE content information. The International Dairy Foods Association expressed mixed reactions, stating that the rule lacks transparency and does not require disclosure of highly refined ingredients from GE foods. Supporters of the Standard, such as the Food Marketing Institute and the National Corn Growers Association, welcomed the disclosure consistency it provides. The inclusion of a voluntary disclosure option in the Standard received mixed responses, with some praising it and others, like the Center for Science in the Public Interest, expressing concerns. The voluntary disclosure option in the Standard received mixed responses. While some praised it, others like the Center for Science in the Public Interest expressed concerns about potential confusion for consumers. Stakeholders also focused on administrative provisions, including compliance dates and recordkeeping requirements. The final rule allows phased implementation, with most regulated entities starting on January 1, 2020, and small food manufacturers beginning on January 1, 2021. The Standard requires regulated entities to maintain records for bioengineered foods on the List, with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2022. Entities must document whether foods or ingredients are bioengineered, except for foods not on the List unless known to be bioengineered. Records must be detailed enough for AMS to audit, and maintained for two years. Entities must maintain records for bioengineered foods on the List, with sufficient detail for AMS to audit, for two years after sale or distribution. The 2016 Act prohibits failure to disclose required information but limits enforcement mechanisms. USDA cannot recall food for Standard violations, and civil penalties are not addressed. Compliance is enforced through audits, examinations, and public disclosure of findings. AMS relies on public complaints to investigate potential violations and may audit entity records if necessary. The National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard outlines AMS's response to complaints, including audits of responsible entities' records. Stakeholder responses focused on applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions. Some advocated for early compliance, while others supported a delay for adjustment. Critics argue enforcement mechanisms are weak. Some critics argue that the enforcement mechanisms of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard are weak. State-level GE labeling initiatives predated the federal 2016 Act due to public interest. Despite research showing no health differences, concerns about genetic engineering persist among consumers, leading to calls for GE foods to be easily identifiable through labeling. Many consumers demanded government-mandated labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods. Various state laws and initiatives on GE labeling emerged, with Vermont being the first to enact a mandatory GE labeling law in 2014. The federal 2016 Act preempted state laws and required mandatory labeling of GE ingredients in foods. Some states enacted laws for mandatory GE labeling, while others considered similar legislation. Michigan and North Dakota urged Congress for a uniform GE labeling standard. Proponents argued for consumers' right to know, while opponents questioned the scientific basis and potential market disruption. Before the 2016 Act, calls for federal legislation to preempt state laws were made. In 2015, USDA experimented with a voluntary labeling program for GE ingredients. In 2015, USDA used its Process Verified Program (PVP) to certify the absence of GE ingredients in food products from a single company. Proponents of GE labeling advocated for mandatory labeling to meet consumer demands, while voluntary programs existed before legislation requiring mandatory labels on foods containing GE ingredients. These programs use on-package symbols to indicate the absence of GE ingredients or production methods without genetic engineering. Food producers can choose to participate in these programs at their own cost. The Non-GMO Project and USDA National Organic Program offer voluntary labeling programs for food products without genetic engineering. Companies can opt into these programs to have their processes verified and products tested for GE ingredients. The symbols on food packaging indicate the absence of GE ingredients, providing consumers with assurance of non-GMO products. The NOP symbol indicates that a food meets criteria excluding genetic engineering. Voluntary labeling programs affirmatively identify foods not derived from bioengineering. The Standard does not address GE-absence claims, with FDA retaining authority over such claims. Implementation of the Standard will impact consumers, regulated entities, and AMS, with potential issues becoming clearer over time. The implementation of the Standard will impact consumers, regulated entities, and AMS, with potential issues becoming clearer over time. Concerns related to applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions may arise as implementation continues. Congress may need to monitor the new Standard's implementation to ensure alignment with congressional intent. Stakeholders may question AMS's decisions in the rulemaking process and the extent to which implementation aligns with congressional intent. Groups may call on Congress to amend the definition of bioengineered to include highly refined products and products from new technologies. The implementation of the Standard may raise concerns regarding applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions. Stakeholders may advocate for a more restrictive or expansive listing of bioengineered foods. Public familiarity with required labels and consumer reactions to disclosure may influence potential revisions. AMS is committed to updating the List of bioengineered food products through annual reviews, allowing for the addition of new products that have entered commerce. The implementation of the Standard may require additional federal resources for compliance. AMS estimated a need for $2 million annually to update the List, conduct audits, manage complaints, and provide training. Congress may need to allocate new resources for continued implementation. Regulated entities may incur costs for identifying and maintaining records on disclosed foods. The new Standard may result in significant administrative costs for regulated entities, estimated to range from $459 million to nearly $3.6 billion in the first year. Enforcement of the rule relies on a public notification mechanism, which stakeholders may find successful depending on the extent of violations. Market demand for bioengineered products versus non-bioengineered products remains uncertain, as consumers' reactions to bioengineered disclosures on food labels are unpredictable. Interested parties may petition Congress to enhance compliance with the new Standard. Market demand for bioengineered versus non-bioengineered products is uncertain, as consumer reactions to bioengineered disclosures on food labels are unpredictable. Manufacturers may avoid labeling 20% of their products as bioengineered to account for potential consumer reactions. The implementation of the Standard may influence demand for bioengineered and non-bioengineered foods, with potential impacts on international trade. AMS does not expect the Standard to impact foreign trade, but unexpected issues may arise. Congress may address concerns about market shifts resulting from the Standard. AMS states that the Standard may not impact foreign trade, but the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service is prepared to assist foreign countries in understanding the Standard. Congress may address trade issues by amending labeling requirements. Definitions of human alterations of plants and animals are derived from USDA's Agricultural Biotechnology Glossary. Modern biotechnology includes genetic engineering, conventional breeding, gene editing, GE labeling, and genetic modification for specific agricultural uses. Genetic engineering involves manipulating an organism's genes using recombinant DNA techniques to alter genetic characteristics. Genetic modification produces heritable improvements in plants or animals through genetic engineering or traditional methods. Genetic modification involves producing heritable improvements in plants or animals through genetic engineering or traditional methods. This process includes creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and transgenic organisms by inserting genetic material from one organism into another using recombinant DNA techniques. Selective breeding is also used to deliberately cross organisms to achieve desired characteristics. A genetically modified organism (GMO) is created by inserting genetic material from one organism into another using recombinant DNA techniques. A variety is a genetically distinct group of plants within a species."
