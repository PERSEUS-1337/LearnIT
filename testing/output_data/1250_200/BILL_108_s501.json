    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under Chapter B. This program includes authorized activities for supporting these students. The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes the need to provide services for gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities or English as a second language. Elementary school students who are gifted have already mastered a significant portion of the material before the school year begins. Teachers face a variety of traits and needs among their students. Most teachers receive training to meet the needs of diverse students, but lack training for gifted students. Public schools are crucial for providing services to high-ability students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Gifted education programs in public schools are essential for equal educational opportunities. Parents and families play a vital role in developing appropriate educational services. Parents and families are crucial partners in developing educational services for gifted students. There is no federal requirement to identify or serve the 3 million gifted students in the nation. Disparities exist in resources and services for gifted students due to varying state laws and funding mechanisms. It is important for more students to achieve at higher levels to meet future economic and national security needs. In order to meet the needs of the United States, it is crucial for more students to achieve at higher levels, especially highly capable students who need education to excel in innovative and creative work. The performance of advanced students in the US in math and science studies was among the lowest globally. In 1990, very little funding was allocated for challenging programs for gifted students in elementary and secondary education. The Secretary may award competitive grants to State educational agencies for developing gifted education programs if the appropriation is between $7,500,000 and $57,500,000. If the appropriation exceeds $57,500,000, formula grants may be awarded to State educational agencies for the same purpose. Grant funds can be used for providing direct educational services and materials. Grant funds provided under this chapter can be used for activities such as providing direct educational services and materials to gifted and talented students, including curriculum compacting, modified curriculum, acceleration, independent study, and dual enrollment. However, funds cannot be used for purchasing or upgrading technological hardware. State educational agencies receiving grants under this chapter can only use a maximum of 10% of the funds for specific purposes such as disseminating program information, providing technical assistance, monitoring programs, supporting parental education, and creating a gifted education advisory board. Additionally, administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the funds available to the agency. \"State educational agencies receiving grants under this chapter can use a maximum of 10% of funds for specific purposes. Administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of available funds.\" The Secretary reserves funds for programs in schools operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. States receive allotments based on population, with a minimum grant amount set. Unclaimed funds are reallocated to other states. \"State application for funds under SEC. 5467B is outlined.\" To be eligible for a grant under this chapter, a State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary containing assurances on how the funds will be used to support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, make competitive grants to local educational agencies, supplement existing funds for gifted education, and provide matching funds. The State educational agency must provide matching funds for gifted and talented student programs, develop assessment models for accountability, and receive approval from the Secretary for grant applications under this chapter. The State educational agency must allocate at least 90 percent of funds to local educational agencies through a competitive process for grants to carry out authorized activities. Grants awarded should meet the needs of students served. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the State educational agency to receive a grant for identifying and supporting gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds. The application must include assurances on how the funds will be used, training of personnel, and ensuring funds supplement existing resources. The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003 requires State educational agencies to submit annual reports on the number of students served and activities supported with funds. Recipients can serve gifted students alongside those with similar needs. Grants must ensure equitable participation of private school students and teachers. Definitions are provided in the legislation. The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003 defines 'gifted and talented' individuals based on applicable State law or educational agency definitions. The term 'State' includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Authorization of Appropriations for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is set at $170,000,000 annually from 2004 to 2010. $7,500,000 is allocated for Chapter A, with the remainder for Chapter 2. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, amendments are made to various sections by replacing \"part\" with \"chapter\" and redesignating subsections."
