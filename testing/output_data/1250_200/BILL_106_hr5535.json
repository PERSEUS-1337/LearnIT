    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection, allocating a minimum of 10% of engineering research grants for this purpose starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose artificial reef and habitat restoration projects instead of fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered as privately owned shores for eligibility in shoreline protection projects. Cost sharing provisions are also updated to include such publicly owned shores. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to implement these changes and ensure public access to every one-half mile of shoreline. The Secretary will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore for which assistance is provided, with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Funds are to be used for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA, and for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects by the Secretary of the Army. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army carries out these projects according to cost-sharing requirements and reports transactions to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. Excess funds are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect data on coastal oceans and waterways. Data collected will include wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, and water quality. The pilot program for a comprehensive ocean monitoring network will include tracking sewage outfall movement, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, weather, river mouth outflow sediment observation, and coastal mapping. Federal cooperation will involve the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California and another location. Coordination with existing efforts will be ensured. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate with existing efforts of Federal, State, and local entities in monitoring ocean conditions for the pilot program. $4,000,000 from the Beach Nourishment Account will be available annually from 2001 to 2006, with $2,000,000 allocated for each of the 2 regional test projects mentioned."
