Hospitals must link to this data on their websites. The amendments made by this section require hospitals to include a link to payment data on their websites. Effective date applies to contracts entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Act mandates that MedPAC's annual reports to Congress include data on the percentage of charity care provided by hospitals. Additionally, a report on charity care trends from certain hospitals must be made publicly available. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act now requires the Secretary of the Treasury to post hospital data on a publicly accessible website for consumer comparison by zip code. Additionally, hospitals must provide a link to this data on their homepage as per Medicare requirements. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals to include a link on their website to data posted under section 9007(e)(2)(C) for consumer comparison by zip code. Effective for contracts entered into or renewed after the Act's enactment date."
