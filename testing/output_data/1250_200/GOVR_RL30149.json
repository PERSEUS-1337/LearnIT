It had a 10% tax rate and included eight tax preference items, with capital gains income being a significant one. The tax has been modified multiple times since 1969, with major changes in 1976 and 1978 leading to the creation of the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was introduced in 1978 with tax rates ranging from 10% to 25%. Congress repealed the add-on minimum tax in 1982 and expanded the AMT base, changing the tax rate to 20%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 further increased the AMT rate to 21%, adjusted the exemption amount, broadened the tax base, and introduced a phase-out for high-income taxpayers. The AMT exemption amount was phased out for taxpayers with AMT taxable income exceeding certain limits. The most significant change affecting the AMT was the repeal of the exclusion for long-term capital gains income, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 increased the AMT tax rate to 24%. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 made further changes to the AMT. The AMT tax rate was increased to 24% in 1990. In 1993, the AMT exemption amounts were raised and a two-tiered tax rate structure was created. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 aligned capital gains tax rates under the regular income tax with the AMT. In 1999, nonrefundable personal tax credits could offset regular income tax fully for that year only. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 made changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), allowing individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their nonrefundable personal tax credits regardless of the AMT. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 temporarily increased the AMT exemption amount. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 increased the AMT exemption amount for joint returns by $4,000 ($2,000 for unmarried individuals) for tax years 2001-2004. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 raised the basic AMT exemption amount to $58,000 for joint returns and $40,250 for unmarried taxpayers for tax years 2003-2004. It also applied a maximum tax rate of 15% to capital gains and dividend income under the AMT. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended the AMT exemption increases through 2005 and allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset both regular and AMT tax liability for taxable years 2004-2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 made changes to the AMT, coordinating farmer and fisherman income averaging with the AMT and repealing limitations on the use of the AMT foreign tax credit. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 increased the AMT exemption amount for 2006 and extended provisions allowing nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset AMT tax liability. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable, allowing taxpayers to claim an AMT refundable credit amount based on unused minimum credit from previous years. The AMT refundable credit is reduced for taxpayers with higher incomes. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 further adjusted AMT exemption levels and allowed certain tax credits to offset AMT liability. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable, allowing taxpayers to claim an AMT refundable credit amount based on unused minimum credit from previous years. The AMT refundable credit is reduced for taxpayers with higher incomes. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 further adjusted AMT exemption levels and allowed certain tax credits to offset AMT liability. In subsequent years, various acts extended the AMT patch, raising exemption amounts and allowing nonrefundable personal credits against AMT liability. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and subsequent acts adjusted the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) exemption amounts for 2010-2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently indexed the AMT based on FY2012 exemption amounts. The AMT is calculated by adding back tax preference items to taxable income, subtracting the exemption amount, and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure. The permanent indexation of the AMT reduces revenues by $1.816 trillion over the 2013-2022 budget window. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is calculated by adding back tax preference items to taxable income and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28%. Tax preference items include tax-exempt interest on certain private-activity bonds, excess depletion deductions, and differences in depreciation rates. The taxpayer pays the greater of their regular income tax liability or AMT tax liability, with any excess AMT tax credit carried forward to offset future regular income tax liabilities. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) involves adjustments to the tax base, including disallowing certain itemized deductions such as miscellaneous expenses, state tax payments, and medical expenses below 10% of adjusted gross income. Other adjustments include using the percentage of completion method for long-term contracts, capitalizing mining exploration costs, and including the excess of fair market value on incentive stock options in the AMT tax base. Personal exemptions and standard deductions do not reduce the AMT tax base. The AMT tax base includes stock options and is not reduced by personal exemptions or standard deductions. The AMT exemption is subtracted before calculating AMT tax liability, with 2013 exemption amounts of $80,800 for joint filers and $51,900 for single filers. The exemption is phased out for taxpayers with AMT taxable income exceeding certain thresholds. Once the AMT tax base is reduced by the exemption, the AMT tax liability is determined using the tax rate schedule. The AMT tax base is reduced by the applicable exemption amount, and the AMT tax liability is determined by applying the tax rate schedule. The 2013 AMT tax rate schedule is 26% on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income and 28% on any additional income. The maximum tax rate for capital gains and dividend income is 15%. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax. Even if not subject to the AMT, it can still affect regular income tax liability. Starting in 2012, most nonrefundable personal credits will be allowed to offset AMT liability. Starting in 2005, taxpayers were allowed to offset their AMT liability with nonrefundable personal tax credits. After the enactment of ATRA in 2012, most nonrefundable personal credits could be used against the AMT. The AMT tax credit is designed to prevent double taxation on certain preference items. The credit can be carried forward to offset regular income tax liabilities in future years. Many analysts were concerned about the increase in upper-middle income taxpayers before ATRA. Before the enactment of ATRA, analysts were concerned about the rise in upper-middle income taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that over 30 million taxpayers would have been on the AMT in 2012 without congressional action. The AMT was not indexed for inflation, causing tax liability to increase over time due to inflation-induced increases in income and expenses. This led to a gap between tax liabilities under the regular income tax and the AMT. The tax liability increased due to inflation-induced increases in nominal income and expenses, narrowing the gap between regular income tax and the AMT. With AMT indexation under ATRA, this issue is less critical. The permanent indexation of the AMT ensures lower baseline tax revenue, which may be important for revenue neutrality in tax reform. The AMT poses a dilemma from an economic perspective. The alternative minimum tax poses a dilemma in the tax system, as an economically ideal income tax would eliminate the need for it. Economic theory suggests reforming the regular income tax to align it with ideal principles, potentially eliminating the alternative minimum tax. However, it is unlikely that the regular income tax base will be broadened enough to render the alternative minimum tax unnecessary. Congress may need to balance preserving tax incentives with the concept of everyone paying their fair share. The alternative minimum tax was originally intended for high-income taxpayers but changes in the tax code have expanded its coverage to middle and upper-middle income ranges, leading to significant deviations in income tax liabilities. Congress faces the challenge of modifying the AMT to limit the number of taxpayers subject to it while preserving social and economic incentives in the tax code."
