Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives live on or near Indian lands with a high unemployment rate of 45 percent. These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and retail trade. The number of businesses owned by these groups grew significantly from 1992 to 1997, outpacing the growth of all businesses during that period. The Small Business Development Center program is cost-effective, with clients generating additional tax revenues of $468,000,000 in 1998. Business counseling is critical on Indian lands where services are scarce. Assistance through counseling has been shown to reduce default rates in lending programs. The Business Development Center program aims to stimulate economies on Indian lands, foster economic development, assist in creating and expanding small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, provide management and technical assistance, seek advice from Tribal Councils, and ensure full access to business counseling for Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.
