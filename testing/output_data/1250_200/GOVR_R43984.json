For example, Taylor Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings, but she cannot dictate how the service uses other recorded versions of her musical works. Ryan Adams was able to cover her album 1989 on Spotify under certain conditions and paying Swift a royalty. Taylor Swift, as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings, can withdraw her music from Spotify but cannot control how the service uses other versions of her songs. The payment she receives for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address music distribution on the internet, aiming to balance combating piracy and protecting revenue sources in the music industry. The evolution of music distribution has seen a shift towards digital services, blurring traditional lines of exploitation. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple's iTunes Music Store in 2003 provided a legal option for purchasing songs online. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales, with Apple dominating the market. After dominating the market with digital music downloads, Apple faced declining sales as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. To combat this, Apple launched Apple Music in 2015. The rise of subscription music services has significantly changed music consumption patterns, with streaming services accounting for a large portion of total U.S. recording industry retail spending. Despite some growth in consumer spending on music in recent years, it remains significantly below its 1999 peak. Consumer spending on music in the U.S. grew 14% between 2016 and 2017 but remains nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak. This shift in consumption patterns impacts how creators and music industry professionals are compensated for their work under copyright law. Rights to musical works are typically licensed to third parties for distribution and reproduction, known as \"mechanical rights.\" Owners of musical works and sound recordings have exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the work to the public. The term \"mechanical right\" originates from the 1909 Copyright Act, where music publishers issued licenses for reproducing musical compositions. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to publicly perform their works. The Copyright Act grants owners of sound recordings the right to public performance for digital audio transmissions. This right applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on CDs privately, while record labels pay music publishers for distribution rights. Retail outlets are involved in the distribution process. (record labels) pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works in physical or digital formats. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels. Radio listeners have less control over song choice compared to purchasing. Broadcast radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists but do pay music publishers and songwriters. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Traditional broadcast radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners. Ephemeral recordings fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand through conditional downloads. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works and sound recordings. The music industry involves songwriters, recording artists, and music licensees who obtain rights to reproduce and distribute music. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs to record labels and collect royalties. Publishers pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. They monitor and generate revenue from music use requiring mechanical licensing rights. Music publishers play a crucial role in monitoring, promoting, and generating revenue from music use that requires mechanical licensing rights. They often contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers share royalty income, with a standard 50-50 division between them. Major publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the U.S. music publishing revenue. Music publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the U.S. music publishing revenue. Independent publishing companies handle the creative aspects of songwriting management, while major publishers handle royalty administration. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights, and record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. The three largest record labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. They handle functions such as adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists may contract with a label or distribute their own recordings, with contracts typically requiring artists to transfer copyrights for a share of royalties. Recording artists transfer their copyrights to record labels for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide artists' careers. Major labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner dominate the industry's revenue. Independent labels rely on major labels for distribution. Independent recording artists like Chance the Rapper retain their copyrights and distribute their music without signing with major record labels. Chance earns money through touring and merchandise sales, and Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights to his album, Coloring Book. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative music into tangible form, handling tasks like song selection and studio booking. Record producers handle creative and administrative tasks in music production, including selecting songs, booking studios, and hiring musicians. Artists now contract with producers directly, giving them control over compensation terms. Sound engineers oversee recording sessions, while mixers piece together finished products. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but some may negotiate royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act granted copyright owners the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. The 1909 Copyright Act granted copyright owners the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music, including the distribution of copies to the public for private use. Concerns about a potential monopoly led to the establishment of the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to address the issue of exclusive rights being bought up by large player-piano manufacturers like the Aeolian Company. The 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to address concerns about a potential monopoly in music reproduction. This allowed music publishers/songwriters to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording was distributed to the public, others could make similar use of it by paying a specified royalty. The compulsory mechanical license required payment of a royalty rate set by the government, such as the $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" rate. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976, specifying that rates would be payable for each record. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying rates payable for each record made and distributed. It defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses. Licensees must serve a notice of intention (NOI) to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office if the owner's address is unknown. The Act also made it easier for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability. The 1976 Copyright Act removed limitations on liability for copyright owners, making it easier to sue for infringement. It also eliminated the requirement for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. This change allows copyright owners to receive royalties under a compulsory license without identifying themselves to the Copyright Office. The 1976 Copyright Act made it easier to sue for infringement and removed the need for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use.\" Reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees. A separate royalty tribunal was established by Congress in 1976 to set royalty rates for mechanical licenses. The 1976 Copyright Act established a separate royalty tribunal to set rates for mechanical licenses. The tribunal was later replaced by the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel in 1993 and then by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) in 2004. The CRB, composed of three administrative judges, sets licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for negotiated voluntary licenses. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for negotiated voluntary licenses. In 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA), amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. Congress directed that rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries should distinguish between incidental and general deliveries, sparking a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" The Office proposed new rules in response to concerns about the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. A landmark agreement was reached in 2008 regarding mechanical licenses for music streaming services. The agreement required music streaming services to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive, audio-only streaming services were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, to apply through 2012. The CRB adopted a modified version of the agreement in 2009, applying through 2012. In 2012, a new agreement was reached for mechanical royalty rates and standards for music streaming services. The CRB adopted the terms for rates from 2013-2017 and issued initial rates for 2018-2022. Licensees pay flat rates for physical deliveries and downloads, while interactive streaming rates are based on formulas tied to service revenues. The formulas used by music streaming services calculate the pool of money available for distribution to publishers for mechanical royalty payments. The amount each publisher receives is based on set formulas, with minimum payments during free trial periods. Rates are either overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission for public performances. In 1914, composers formed ASCAP to address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances. ASCAP and SESAC are performance rights organizations that issue public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to publicly perform musical works for a flat fee or percentage of revenues, with royalties collected by PROs and distributed to publishers and songwriters. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. As radio grew in popularity, SESAC expanded to include U.S. composers. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on advertising revenues. To compete with ASCAP, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. GMR was established in 2013 as a fourth PRO. In 1940, a dispute over royalty rates between radio stations and ASCAP led to a DOJ investigation into antitrust violations. BMI and ASCAP both entered consent decrees in 1941 to avoid antitrust lawsuits. The decrees imposed similar requirements on the PROs regarding licensing rights. While ASCAP and BMI consent decrees are not identical, they share many key features. These include nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory licensing terms, acceptance of all qualifying members, and offering alternative licenses. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. The public performance of musical works is not subject to compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. The rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are determined by federal district court judges to ensure they are \"reasonable\" and consider the PROs' power over the market. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. Congress included this provision in the DPRA to prevent adverse effects on music performance royalties. The concern among writers and publishers is that license fees for sound recordings may impact music performance royalties. The DOJ periodically reviews the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation of the consent decrees in 2017. Congress enacted the 1971 Sound Recording Act to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was enacted to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California's record piracy law applied to pre-1972 sound recordings. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright but exempted pre-1972 works from federal protection. This was to prevent works from automatically entering the public domain. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright but exempted pre-1972 works from federal protection. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make temporary reproductions of sound recordings. Rates and terms for the Section 112 license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive fees through SoundExchange. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not receive Section 112 fees. In the context of recording public performance royalties, copyright owners of sound recordings receive Section 112 fees, while recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not. The Copyright Act did not initially provide public performance rights to record labels and artists until the 1990s. Amendments like the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 addressed concerns about music piracy by granting exclusive public performance rights to record labels and artists for their sound recordings. The DPRA also established a compulsory license for certain digital audio services. The DPRA in 1995 established a compulsory license for digital audio services, addressing concerns about music piracy and granting public performance rights to record labels and artists. The DMCA in 1998 expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services. The DMCA in 1998 expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services, setting up a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to a different standard aimed at representing negotiated rates in the marketplace. The DMCA in 1998 expanded statutory licensing provisions for online music services, setting up different rate-setting standards for services existing before July 31, 1998, and newer music streaming services. The purpose was to prevent disruption of existing operations and enable negotiation of public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. Interactive services were highlighted as potentially impacting traditional record sales and copyright owners' control over their work. Interactive services are seen as the most likely to impact traditional record sales, posing a threat to livelihoods dependent on revenue from record sales. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations. The Senate Judiciary Committee aimed to balance interests in 1995, noting the benefits of airplay and promotional activities for sound recordings and performers. Legislation should not disrupt the mutually beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry. Broadcast radio is distinguished from other services for its mix of entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates for broadcast radio, which provides a mix of entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities. Participants engage in negotiations and may reach agreements on statutory rates, which are then submitted to the CRB for approval. The CRB has the option to decline agreements that do not represent all parties involved. The CRB may adopt proposed rates or decline to adopt them as statutory terms. If no agreement is reached, live testimony is heard, and a determination is issued. Participants can request a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. The CRB sets per-performance rates for online music services using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard and percentage-of-revenue rates using the Section 801(b)(1) standard for public performances. The CRB sets per-performance rates for online music services using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard and percentage-of-revenue rates for public performances. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes for music streaming services. The most recent agreements expired in 2015, and the CRB began setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. During the CRB rate proceeding for noninteractive music streaming services from 2016-2020, questions arose about the exclusion of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. SoundExchange, Pandora Media, and Clear Channel disagreed on whether these agreements could be used as evidence. The CRB determined these questions were novel material questions of substantive law and referred them to Congress. The CRB referred novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution regarding the 2009 Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. In December 2015, the CRB issued rate decisions for streaming services for 2016-2020, setting rates tied to the Consumer Price Index and including ephemeral royalties fees with Section 114 royalties. In 2017, the CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for 2018-2022. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for 2018-2022. Public performance rates vary based on the type of music service and when it began operating. Royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed among copyright owners, featured recording artists, nonfeatured musicians, and nonfeatured vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split of royalties for noninteractive digital services, but can be compensated through SoundExchange with a letter of direction from the artist. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services in setting rates for public performance rights is defined by 17 U.S.C. Section 114. This distinction is not applied in specifying when a digital service must obtain mechanical rights from music publishers under 17 U.S.C. Section 115. The CRB has adopted these distinctions in setting rates for mechanical licenses. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on a case related to this issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 2009 that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not interactive, to protect sound recording copyright holders from lost sales. The service's predictability could deter users from purchasing music. The court ruled that LAUNCHcast's unique playlists did not ensure predictability, making it a noninteractive service eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance and the number of tracks from a single album or artist played in a three-hour period. This decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio could obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The CRB established rates for personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio to obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. These services are distinguished from Spotify, which offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Users can access songs for free with ads on personal computers or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on multiple devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate royalty rates collectively. The DPRA allows for collective negotiation with SiriusXM and other subscription services over royalty rates for public performance rights. Common agents must be nonexclusive to prevent supracompetitive rates. Antitrust exemptions are not provided for interactive services, but common agents can be used for clearinghouse functions. Section 112 of the DMCA addresses ephemeral server reproductions and provides an antitrust exemption for negotiating royalty payments. Section 112(e)(2) provides an exemption for copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating royalty payments for ephemeral recordings. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), this section does not require the designation to be nonexclusive. The CRB, established in 2004, allows for entities designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to receive royalties. This provision ensures that parties under statutory licensing can designate an agent to receive royalties. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for receiving royalties. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that it is copyright law compliant to designate a single collective for royalty distribution. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for receiving royalties in 2006. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., sought recognition to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that selecting a single collective is the most efficient system for royalty distribution under statutory licenses. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the CRB's decision in 2009. The D.C. Circuit upheld the CRB's decision to designate SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments, rejecting Royalty Logic's argument that the CRB couldn't give exclusive payment rights to a single entity. The CRB's authority to set terms of royalty payments was interpreted to include designating a single entity for payments, as evidenced by the selection of SoundExchange as the sole collective for the period 2011-2014. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective by the CRB for royalty payments from licensees. This decision was based on the efficiency of having a single collective for collecting royalties. SoundExchange also reached agreements with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates in 2015, which were approved by the CRB. For the period of January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, SoundExchange was once again designated as the sole collective for managing and distributing sound recording royalties. In the United States, music publishers collect mechanical royalties from recorded music companies and streaming services via third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in September 2015. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for royalty payments from licensees by the CRB. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access. Major labels acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify to grant rights for using their sound recordings. Sony acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify, granting the service rights to use their sound recordings. Sony sold a portion of its stake when Spotify went public, sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. This equity stake influenced the rates paid to music publishers for mechanical licenses tied to record label deals. Organizations representing songwriters and recording artists are concerned about fair payments from digital music services. ASCAP and BMI, representing 90% of songs in the US, may not be sharing payments fairly. Publishers allege they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to restrictions in consent decrees. In 2011, publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate market rates directly with digital services. ASCAP and BMI amended their rules to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for new media uses. However, courts ruled that publishers could not selectively withdraw rights under consent decrees. Major music publishers and PROs asked the Department of Justice for modifications after the rulings. The major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to consent decrees to allow partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ evaluated the consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" DOJ determined in 2016 that the consent decrees required 100% licensing by ASCAP and BMI. On August 4, 2016, the DOJ completed its review of the consent decrees, requiring ASCAP and BMI to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs to promote competition. DOJ did not propose modifications but suggested Congress reconsider copyright law in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit in New York, where it was ruled that fractional licensing was permitted under BMI's consent decree. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision in December 2017. The Copyright Office announced new procedures for filing Notices of Intention (NOIs) to reproduce and distribute musical works under Section 115. Licensees can now file NOIs in bulk electronically, reducing filing costs significantly. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the procedural change. The Music Modernization Act, passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018, aims to streamline the licensing process for digital music services. It includes the creation of a nonprofit mechanical licensing collective funded by online music services to administer blanket mechanical licenses. This bill addresses issues related to proper compensation for songwriters and publishers, following lawsuits against services like Spotify for streaming copyrighted musical works without permission. The Music Modernization Act aims to streamline the licensing process for digital music services by creating a nonprofit mechanical licensing collective funded by online music services. It addresses issues related to proper compensation for songwriters and publishers, including extending federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. The Music Modernization Act establishes a Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) and a digital licensee coordinator to streamline licensing for digital music services. The MLC, funded by online music services, will have a 17-member board of directors and various duties including maintaining a musical works database and administering blanket licenses. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) is responsible for claiming ownership of musical works, providing administrative services for voluntary licenses, and collecting/distributing royalties from online music services. Songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC cannot negotiate royalty rates, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator's duties include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, and enforcing payment obligations. The digital licensing collective is responsible for various tasks such as establishing administrative assessment rates, maintaining records, and participating in proceedings. They are prohibited from engaging in government lobbying activities. Failure to provide reports or royalties could lead to default of the blanket license. Online music services can seek review in federal court if they believe the collective terminated a license improperly. Copyright owners cannot sue a music service with a valid blanket license for infringement. Claims not resolved by the MLC can be brought to federal court. The Music Modernization Act limits the recovery of damages for copyright infringement by online music services if they comply with specified requirements. The Copyright Royalty Board must use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates. The Music Modernization Act allows judges in the Southern District of New York to consider sound recording rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. The system for assigning judges for ASCAP and BMI cases would change to a random process for rate setting cases. The Music Modernization Act changes the process for assigning judges in the Southern District of New York for rate setting cases. Judges overseeing consent decrees are not allowed to oversee rate proceedings. Sound recording creators from certain dates are entitled to payments from digital music services under federal law, in addition to other legal remedies. Owners of pre-1972 sound recordings must file information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. The Music Modernization Act requires the Copyright Office to regulate the filing of sound recording identification information and contact information. Federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings is extended until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers have the right to seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB. The collective must adopt a policy for distributions and be recognized by the CRB. In 2007, the CRB stated that collectives do not need formal recognition to be involved in royalty distribution. Legislation introduced in 2017, such as S.Con.Res. 6 and H.Con.Res. 13, supports no new fees for radio stations. The PROMOTE Act of 2017, H.R. 1914, would give copyright owners the right to withdraw music from broadcast radio stations. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, which aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. In October 2017, Representative Hakeem Jeffries introduced the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, which would establish a Copyright Claims Board as an alternative forum for copyright disputes. The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, proposes a Copyright Claims Board as an alternative forum for copyright disputes, housed within the Copyright Office with jurisdiction limited to civil copyright cases capped at $30,000 in damages. Senator Ron Wyden introduced the ACCESS to Recordings Act, S. 2933, to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, allowing rights holders to receive payments from digital services. Owners must notify alleged infringers of federal copyright registration and infringement. If infringement has stopped, owners cannot claim damages or fees. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, enter public domain after 95 or 120 years. Recordings from 1923-1930 are protected until 2025 if commercially exploited and compliant with regulations."
