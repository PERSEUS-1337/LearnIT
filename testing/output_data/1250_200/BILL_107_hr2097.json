    "content": "The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" highlights the importance of quality early care and education for children. Research shows that early learning and nurturing care significantly impact a child's growth and development. However, many child care centers do not provide adequate care, posing risks to children's safety and health. Despite the availability of Federal assistance, the cost of full-day child care remains high, making it unaffordable for many families. Many families struggle to afford quality child care due to limited funding and low reimbursement rates. This results in providers cutting corners, leading to lower quality care and negative impacts on children's development. Increasing payment rates for child care can lead to higher quality care, allowing providers to hire qualified staff, offer training, maintain a safe environment, and purchase educational materials. This Act aims to enhance child care quality and accessibility by raising payment rates. The Act aims to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child care. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to authorize appropriations of $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent years for grants to improve child care quality. Block grant funds are to be used from funds appropriated under section 658B(a). The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to establish a program and provide grants to improve child care quality, with funds appropriated under section 658B(a) and excluding section 658H. \"Grants are provided to improve the quality of child care under section 658H.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within 2 years. States must submit an application to receive the grant. To apply for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with required information, including details of a market rates survey, a plan to increase payment rates, and how the State will adjust rates based on survey results. The Secretary will only make annual payments to eligible States if they meet continuing eligibility requirements. To remain eligible for annual payments, a State must show progress in maintaining increased payment rates and conduct a survey update every two years. States must also provide matching funds of at least 25% of the costs in cash for activities under this section. Federal funds cannot be used to determine State contributions. The State must provide cash contributions for activities under this section, with Federal funds not included in determining State contributions. The amount appropriated for eligible States shall be allotted based on the same manner as other allotments. States receiving grants must prioritize increasing payment rates for child care assistance up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Funds can be used for other activities to enhance child care quality after reaching the 100th percentile. Under this section, States must use funds to supplement, not supplant, other sources of funding. States must submit evaluations to the Secretary on efforts to increase payment rates and improve child care quality. The Secretary will report to Congress biennially on State progress.
