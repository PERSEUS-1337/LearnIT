Financial institutions can be implicated in TBML schemes when used to settle international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering in June 2015, highlighting trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge. TBML schemes can launder billions of dollars annually, with over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) describing potential TBML activity totaling more than $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also use the international financial system and cash couriers to disguise their activities. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international trade and finance system to hide transactions through various methods, including the co-mingling of funds and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) techniques involve misrepresenting goods' prices, quality, or quantity during cross-border transactions. Over- and under-invoicing of goods and services are common TBML techniques used to obscure the money trail. TBML techniques involve over- and under-invoicing of goods and services, which is a common method for laundering funds across borders. Collusion between parties is required for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more likely to be used in these activities to complicate determining the true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same transaction is another method used in TBML. Money launderers use various techniques such as multiple invoicing, over- and under-shipments, and falsely described goods and services to complicate transactions and evade detection by officials. Multiple invoices for the same transaction can justify multiple payments, while misstating the quantity or quality of goods can further obscure the true nature of the transactions. Collusion between parties is often necessary for these activities, which can involve complex products and supply chains to increase complexity. Financial institutions may be unaware of \"phantom\" transactions involving falsely described goods and services, allowing money launderers to misstate the quality or type of traded goods. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a classic scheme used to launder drug proceeds, with Colombian traffickers disguising billions in profits through trade-based schemes. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a common method used by terrorist organizations, yet it is less understood compared to traditional money laundering methods. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a method that can have a destructive impact on legitimate commerce and government revenue. Transnational criminal organizations may sell imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount to expedite the money laundering process, putting legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage. This activity can hinder entrepreneurship and reduce tax revenue for governments. TBML takes advantage of global trade trends, leading to underpriced goods and fraudulent cargo manifests. Global trends in trade have led to a quadrupling of global trade to $16.4 trillion in 2015. These trends, such as advances in communications and lower transportation costs, have also been exploited by criminal organizations for illegal activities. Organized crime has expanded into new markets to reduce risks and diversify into profitable but hard-to-detect activities, according to a report by the OECD. Criminal groups have adapted to global market trends by engaging in new types of illegal activities to connect production with distant consumers. This has led to economies of scale and efficiencies similar to legitimate trade, allowing for diversification into new illicit markets. The OECD warns that these illegal activities pose challenges for law enforcement and could have significant economic and development impacts, especially in developing countries where illicit money transfers may reduce domestic expenditure and investment. The international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to its enormous volume of trade flows, which obscure individual transactions and provide ample opportunities for value transfer across borders. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing in volume and global reach. TBML involves complex foreign exchange transactions, comingling illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows, limited verification procedures, and resource constraints in customs agencies. SARs between 2004 and 2009 identified TBML activity most frequently in transactions involving Mexico and China, with Panama ranking third. The U.S. Department of State's 2016 report highlighted concerns about TBML activities in countries like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is on the rise globally, with concerns identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and Venezuela. TBML is linked to significant revenue losses, corruption of customs authorities, exploitation of free trade zones, and trade in gold and precious gems. Anecdotal case studies have also shown connections to known terrorist activities. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves informal money brokers like hawaladars, and trade in gold and precious gems. While some terrorist groups have used TBML, it is not the dominant method for terrorist financing according to the Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment. The main methods for moving money to terrorists are physical cash movement, banking system transfers, licensed MSBs, and unlicensed money transmitters. The State Department identified TBML as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, particularly with hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking. It involves trusted money brokers who transfer funds without using traditional financial institutions. Unregulated hawala systems lack transparency and are perceived as risky by government authorities. The State Department's 2016 report highlighted concerns about unregulated hawala systems being vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups, especially in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. U.S. law enforcement identified money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities used to purchase vehicles for laundering drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. The State Department's report raised concerns about TBML schemes involving vehicle dealerships in the United States, with funds from Jordan and Lebanon used to purchase vehicles for export to Lebanon and Jordan, potentially with weapons hidden inside. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern in 2011 for allegedly providing financial support to Hezbollah. The U.S. Treasury designated Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) as a primary money-laundering concern due to its involvement in drug and money laundering schemes supporting Hezbollah. LCB facilitated wire transfers for purchasing used cars in the U.S., which were then shipped to West Africa and the Middle East. Proceeds from car sales were repatriated to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits. Additionally, Asian consumer goods were shipped to Latin America, and the proceeds were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was involved in money laundering schemes supporting Hezbollah, leading to the revocation of its banking license in 2011. Funds from Asian consumer goods were laundered through a BMPE scheme, with proceeds funneled through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts. Individuals associated with this network faced financial sanctions and law enforcement investigations in the U.S. Toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through small deposits to avoid reporting requirements. The toy company Woody Toys received cash payments from narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through small deposits to avoid reporting requirements. The cash deposits were used to purchase toys from China, exported to Colombia, and the proceeds were used to reimburse Colombian drug traffickers through the BMPE. Some employees had ties to a similar scheme at Angel Toy Company. Law enforcement cooperation between the United States and Colombia aided in the investigation. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms. The international drug trafficker in Dubai used various financial methods, including cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms, to move drug proceeds through the financial system disguised as trade financing. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States, opening letters of credit with inflated export values to remit funds to affiliated exporters in India. The international drug trafficker in Dubai used various financial methods to move drug proceeds through the financial system disguised as trade financing. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States, remitting funds to exporters in India. The Indian national facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents and using hawala operators to move funds offshore. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in 1989 to develop AML/CFT guidelines and currently has 34 member countries and 2 regional organizations. It conducts annual self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines, with the ability to suspend non-compliant members. In 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations to combat money laundering. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to FATF to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financing threats. The United States strongly supports the FATF in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF 40 Recommendations were revised in 2012 and again in 2015 to include CFT guidelines and address the financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The revised FATF 40 Recommendations aim to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The new standards address new and emerging threats, strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations, and improve transparency on beneficial ownership. Despite the recognition of the growing opportunities for abuse in international trade and financing, specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included in the current set of recommendations. The FATF has issued reports on trade-based money laundering (TBML) and recommended jurisdictions to develop specific training programs to detect TBML activities. The lack of comprehensive data on TBML is attributed to jurisdictions not identifying it separately from general money laundering activities. The Treasury Department's FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML through advisories, geographic targeting orders, and special measures. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, highlighting red flags for financial institutions to detect money laundering activities. They first addressed TBML in 1997 and continue to provide guidance on reporting suspicious activity related to TBML. In 2014, an updated advisory focused on increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on TBML involving funnel accounts, providing red flags for detecting suspicious activity. FinCEN also utilizes Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions in specific areas to combat criminal activity. GTOs are time-limited and can only be in effect for a maximum of 180 days, with violators facing civil or criminal penalties. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters, requiring them to report cash transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by criminal organizations. The GTO was renewed for an additional 180 days in October 2015. Another GTO in the same month targeted businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District with similar cash reporting requirements to disrupt suspected criminal activities. The GTO targeting businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District lowered cash reporting to $3,000 to combat BMPE schemes by drug traffickers. FinCEN may impose special measures under BSA to address money laundering concerns, including enhanced due diligence and prohibiting certain transactions. OFAC may also take administrative actions against designated foreign nationals and entities. In April 2013, FinCEN designated Lebanese exchange houses Halawi and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme. These exchange houses facilitated transactions related to a large-scale TBML scheme involving the export of used cars from the US to West Africa. US authorities also linked them to money laundering services for an international narcotics trafficking network associated with Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities using specialized computer systems. The \"Data Analysis and Research for Trade Transparency System\" (TTUs) are specialized computer systems used by HSI and Treasury to identify trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data, such as TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. TTUs have been established in various countries with funding from the Department of State's INL, aiming to create an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritized attacking TBML, leading to the deployment of ICE-led TTUs for data exchange and analysis. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations resulting from TTU activities, with over $1 billion seized since the initiative began. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings, including its links to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, as well as the role of TTUs. There is interest in linking U.S. trade policy to combatting TBML and terrorist financing. The 114th Congress has focused on the connection between TBML and terrorist financing, with concerns about links to groups like Hezbollah. In response, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. OFAC issued a final rule in April 2016 to implement this act. The 114th Congress has addressed the issue of trade-based money laundering (TBML) and its connection to terrorist financing, particularly with groups like Hezbollah. OFAC implemented the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 in April 2016 to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. President Obama has pledged to take strong action against Hezbollah operatives and supporters through sanctions. Treasury Department aims to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system's strength. Congressional committees continue to monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has addressed trade-based money laundering (TBML) connected to terrorist financing, particularly with groups like Hezbollah. Congressional committees have held hearings on TBML, including topics like stopping terror finance and examining terror funding streams from South America. Treasury Department aims to implement financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions while preserving the Lebanese financial system's strength. The House Homeland Security Committee and House Financial Services Committee have held hearings on current terrorist financing trends, preventing cultural genocide by ISIS, and the state of the international financial system. The Senate Armed Services Committee reviewed defense authorization requests for Fiscal Year 2017. The House Financial Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing, including trade-based money laundering and private donations. The Senate Judiciary Committee also reviewed immigration enforcement policies and their impact on public safety. The House Homeland Security Committee, House Financial Services Committee, and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have conducted hearings on border security, terrorism financing, and transnational crime. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the impact of transnational crime on border security. The House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere, while the House Financial Services Committee focused on the international financial system during their annual testimony by the Secretary of the Treasury."
