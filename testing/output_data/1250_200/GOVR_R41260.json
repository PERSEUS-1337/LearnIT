    "content": "One of Justice Stevens's lasting legacies is his opinion in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, a landmark case in administrative law. The decision established the legal framework for deference to federal agencies in interpreting statutes. The Chevron analysis, though simple in theory, has led to confusion and challenges for federal judges. Despite efforts to clarify the doctrine, Justice Stevens may find himself in the minority on certain aspects as he leaves the Court. The report will detail the Chevron decision, the two-part test for agency deference, and its influence in administrative law. The Chevron case involved the \"bubble concept\" in the Clean Air Act, where the EPA allowed states to calculate emissions from stationary sources as a whole. The EPA allowed states to calculate emissions from stationary sources as a whole, using the \"bubble concept.\" The Natural Resources Defense Council challenged this interpretation, leading to a Supreme Court case. The Court upheld the EPA's regulation, establishing a two-part test for reviewing agency authority. Justice Stevens summarized the Chevron analysis, emphasizing the importance of Congress's clear intent in statutory interpretation. The courts must defer to an agency's permissible construction of a statute if Congress has not directly addressed the issue at hand. This established a highly deferential judicial role in reviewing agency interpretations of their authorizing statutes. In the Chevron analysis, Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of Congress's clear intent in statutory interpretation. The courts must defer to an agency's permissible construction of a statute if Congress has not directly addressed the issue at hand. Stevens found the EPA's \"plantwide\" regulation to be a reasonable interpretation of the Clean Air Act. In the Chevron analysis, Justice Stevens found the EPA's \"plantwide\" regulation to be a reasonable interpretation of the Clean Air Act. He identified three rationales for deferring to an agency's statutory interpretation: congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability. Deference to an agency's interpretation is seen as necessary when filling gaps in statutory uncertainty, as the agency has been delegated policymaking authority by Congress. Deference to an agency's interpretation of statutes is justified by congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability. Judges lack expertise in certain areas and should respect the agency's interpretation. Political accountability supports agency decisions in resolving ambiguous statutes. The Chevron decision by Justice Stevens has been cited in over 11,000 judicial opinions, establishing a legal framework for resolving competing interests between agencies and courts in interpreting statutes. Despite its continued relevance, questions remain about the application of the Chevron analysis. The opinion continues to be cited regularly, with the basic framework serving as an authority in delineating interpretive roles of courts and agencies. Justice Stevens's opinion in Chevron is a significant authority in defining the interpretive roles of courts and agencies. Whenever an agency interprets its authorizing statute or a statute it administers with the \"force of law,\" the Chevron framework is triggered. This framework is often used by courts when agencies clarify statutory ambiguities to justify their actions, leading to landmark cases on agency overreach. Despite its influence, some believe that Chevron's impact is diminishing as the Court less frequently relies on it. Chevron's influence is potentially waning as the Court has been using it less frequently as a controlling precedent for agency statutory interpretation. There are ongoing disputes about the proper application of the Chevron test, including questions about what agency interpretations qualify for deference and what tools of statutory construction should be used. Justice Stevens has played a key role in these debates. In a 2009 Supreme Court case, Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc., the Court debated the application of the Chevron test, specifically regarding which step should come first. The majority upheld an EPA interpretation that considered the cost of technology as part of the \"best technology available.\" Justice Scalia deemed EPA's position reasonable, while Justice Stevens criticized the majority for not first determining if Congress had clearly spoken on the issue. Stevens accused the majority of assuming ambiguity before moving to the reasonableness test. In 2001, the Supreme Court added a new threshold requirement, or \"step zero,\" to the Chevron analysis in U.S. v. Mead Corp. Justice Souter determined that Chevron deference applies when Congress delegates authority to the agency to make rules with the force of law. Mead and Christensen v. Harris established that Chevron deference hinges on the formality of the agency's process and the extent of authority delegated by Congress. The Supreme Court established in U.S. v. Mead Corp. that Chevron deference depends on the formality of the agency's process and the extent of authority delegated by Congress. Policy statements and interpretive letters do not warrant Chevron deference, while formal rules with the \"force of law\" qualify for it. Interpretations not meeting Chevron deference may still receive Skidmore deference, where courts defer to persuasive agency interpretations. The \"force of law\" standard from Mead has not been clearly defined, with additional factors considered for Chevron deference. The Court has added factors for Chevron deference, including the interstitial nature of the legal question, agency expertise, importance to statute administration, complexity of administration, and agency consideration over time. Justice Scalia disagrees with the Mead standard, foreseeing ongoing consequences. Justice Stevens is involved in a dispute over the Chevron test application, highlighting a divide on whether Congress has addressed the issue. Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia have differing views on the use of legislative history and legislative purpose in determining Congress's intent. Stevens believes in considering these factors, while Scalia advocates for a purely textualist approach. The majority of the Court now seems to lean towards Scalia's position, where the first step in determining ambiguity in a statute is to look at the enacted text. The Court majority supports Scalia's textualist position, while Stevens maintains his intentionalist stance. In the Zuni case, the Court upheld an interpretation under Chevron, despite legislative history suggesting a different understanding. The majority initially favored a textualist approach, emphasizing the importance of plain language in statutes. The majority in the Zuni case determined that the agency's interpretation was reasonable based on an evaluation of the statute's history, while Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of legislative history in the Chevron analysis. Stevens believed that the agency had given effect to Congress's clearly expressed intent, resolving the inquiry at step one of the Chevron test. Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of legislative history in statutory construction, willing to defer to evidence of Congress's intent over clear statutory text. In dissent, Justice Scalia focused solely on the plain language of the statute, criticizing reliance on legislative history and advocating for the importance of what Congress enacted. The departure of Justice Stevens could impact how the Court applies the Chevron test, with a focus on textual interpretation over legislative history. This shift may lead to less deference to agency interpretations and less reliance on congressional intent. The future of the Chevron doctrine may be influenced by the divide between textualists and intentionalists. The impending departure of Justice Stevens, a leader of the intentionalist camp, could have significant consequences for the future of the Chevron doctrine. Justice Stevens laid out a legal framework in his Chevron opinion that is widely cited but still unsettled in its application. As the Court prepares for his departure, the Chevron test will continue to play a role in balancing interpretive roles of courts and administrative agencies."
