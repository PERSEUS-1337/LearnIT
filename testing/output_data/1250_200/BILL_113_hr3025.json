    "content": "The Act titled \"Irene and Lee Tax Relief Storm Recovery Act of 2013\" allows for additional low-income housing credit allocation in states affected by Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee in 2011. The Act \"Irene and Lee Tax Relief Storm Recovery Act of 2013\" increases the State housing credit ceiling for states affected by Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 for calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The \"Irene and Lee Tax Relief Storm Recovery Act of 2013\" increases the State housing credit ceiling for disaster-affected areas in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The applicable limitation is determined by the population of the area or 50% of the State housing credit ceiling for 2013. Unused credits are allocated from the additional allocation amount. The Irene-Lee disaster area is considered a difficult development area for properties placed in service during 2013, 2014, or 2015, and is excluded from the State housing credit ceiling calculation. The limitation under subsection applies to housing credit dollar amounts allocated in 2013, 2014, or 2015, and to bonds issued after December 31, 2012 for properties placed in service after 2012 and before 2020 in nonmetropolitan areas. In a nonmetropolitan area within the Irene-Lee disaster area, the section applies by substituting 'national nonmetropolitan median gross income' for 'area median gross income' in certain cases. Paragraph (1)(B) does not apply to housing credit allocations in 2013, 2014, or 2015 for buildings in the Irene-Lee disaster area placed in service before January 1, 2019. The term 'Irene-Lee disaster area' refers to counties affected by a natural disaster declaration in 2011 due to Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee. The amendment made by this section under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
