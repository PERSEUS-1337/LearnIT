    "content": "The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows for the adjustment of status for certain nationals of Lebanon. The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens within 18 months of enactment, excluding certain grounds for inadmissibility. Aliens with prior orders of exclusion or deportation can still apply for adjustment of status. The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows eligible aliens with temporary protected status in the US to apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions. If the Attorney General grants the application, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. The Lebanese Adjustment Act allows eligible aliens with temporary protected status to apply for adjustment of status under specific conditions, including continuous physical presence in the US since March 28, 1993. Proof of continuous presence is required for the application. To establish continuous physical presence for the Lebanese Adjustment Act, an alien must show evidence of service or business in the US before March 28, 1993, or apply for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act by that date. The Attorney General may require additional proof of physical presence. Additionally, eligible aliens with temporary protected status can apply for adjustment of status under specific conditions, including continuous presence in the US since March 28, 1993, allowing for a stay of removal and work authorization. The Attorney General may provide regulations for aliens to seek a stay of deportation or removal based on an application. During certain proceedings, aliens applying for adjustment of status cannot be removed unless the application is denied. The Attorney General can authorize employment for aliens during the application process. The Attorney General may authorize employment for aliens during the application process, and if the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment must be authorized. Additionally, the status of spouses and children can be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident under certain conditions. To be eligible for adjustment under this subsection, individuals must prove continuous physical presence in the US starting from March 28, 1993, apply within 18 months of enactment, and be admissible for permanent residence. Exclusion grounds from the Immigration and Nationality Act do not apply. Proof of continuous presence is required. To establish eligibility for adjustment of status, individuals must demonstrate continuous physical presence in the US from March 28, 1993, with absences not exceeding 180 days. The Attorney General will provide administrative review rights similar to other adjustment of status applicants. Any decision made by the Attorney General regarding status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The status adjustment of any alien under this section is final and not subject to court review. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply, and the Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement are not affected. Eligibility for permanent residence status does not prevent seeking it under other laws."
