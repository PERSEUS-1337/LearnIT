    "content": "The Act titled \"Stopping Illegal Obamacare Subsidies Act\" limits auto-enrollment in health plans under American Health Benefit Exchanges until inconsistencies are resolved as outlined in a June 2014 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must make public the steps to resolve inconsistencies in eligibility for healthcare programs within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, methods to monitor progress in resolving these inconsistencies must be disclosed. Premium assistance tax credits and reduced cost-sharing programs may be suspended until inconsistencies are resolved. Premium assistance tax credits and cost-sharing programs will not be available for the 2015 plan year until all inconsistencies related to invalid social security numbers are resolved by the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services. If applicant information contains inconsistencies, the Secretary will request additional information within 90 days. During an inconsistency period, individuals may be enrolled in a qualified health plan but cannot access premium assistance credits or reduced cost-sharing programs. If requested information is not provided, the applicant will be withdrawn from these programs. During an inconsistency period, individuals enrolled in a qualified health plan may lose access to premium assistance credits and reduced cost-sharing programs if requested information is not provided. The Secretary will notify the health insurance issuer of disenrollment, and the applicant must re-enroll with accurate information during the next open enrollment period. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"inconsistencies\" refer to differences in self-attested information provided by an applicant for health plan enrollment and data received from data sources, impacting eligibility for financial assistance programs. \"Inconsistency period\" is defined as the 90-day period. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act defines \"inconsistency period\" as the 90-day period following the notice of an inconsistency sent to the applicant."
