    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Courts granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting the Act may violate due process. The PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes may violate due process as it lacks minimum contacts. Courts have issued preliminary injunctions in Red Earth and Gordon cases, while the Musser's Inc. v. United States case rejected the due process argument. The court stated that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state laws and does not implicate due process. The plaintiff was found to have minimum contacts through its interactive website. The Supreme Court's ruling in Quill suggests that Congress may not have the power to require remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act hinges on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers, as outlined in Quill. Minimum contacts depend on the retailer's purposeful economic activities in a state, and the tax paid must be related to the state's values. The PACT Act requires remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with state laws, increase tax collection, discourage smuggling, and reduce youth access. It deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with all applicable laws and taxes as if the sales occurred entirely within the state. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco adhere to state laws, pay taxes, and prevent underage sales. It also requires sellers to pay all applicable taxes and apply necessary stamps before delivery. State taxation of out-of-state businesses must comply with the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. Congress can authorize state actions that would otherwise violate the Commerce Clause but not those that breach it. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco comply with state laws, pay taxes, and prevent underage sales. It also requires sellers to pay all applicable taxes and apply necessary stamps before delivery. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, which is governed by the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill. The Court considered whether an out-of-state mail order retailer needed a physical presence in a state to collect use tax, citing jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The Supreme Court upheld Florida courts' jurisdiction over an out-of-state franchisee conducting business remotely in Florida. Physical presence is not necessary for jurisdiction as business is often conducted across state lines through mail and wire communications. The Court rejected the idea that lack of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction if activities are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. In Quill, the Court found that a retailer had fair warning of tax liability by directing catalogues to North Dakota residents. The retailer had fair warning that it would be subject to the tax and had purposefully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, satisfying the requirement for minimum contacts. The issue under Quill is whether the out-of-state business has directed its activities at the taxing state and has fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, plaintiffs, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians, sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirement on their tobacco sales, arguing it violates Due Process Clause by subjecting them to taxing jurisdiction without sufficient minimum contacts. The United States argued that maintaining websites advertising products for sale establishes minimum contacts. The court found that maintaining a passive website or shipping goods into a state did not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement for the PACT Act. The argument that websites provided minimum contacts was rejected because not all plaintiffs had websites, and the websites were considered passive with no ability to complete purchases online. Additionally, the court rejected the argument that shipping goods into a state established minimum contacts. The court rejected the argument that a single sale creates minimum contacts necessary to impose a duty to collect taxes on an out-of-state seller. It found that a single, isolated sale may not be enough to subject a seller to a foreign jurisdiction, citing cases where a single sale did not satisfy the requirement. The court also noted that the Supreme Court in Quill based its decision on the defendant's \"continuous and widespread solicitation of business\" rather than a single sale into the state. The court ruled that a single sale does not create enough minimum contacts to impose tax collection duties on an out-of-state seller. It emphasized the importance of \"continuous and widespread solicitation of business\" rather than a single sale into the state. The court found that the PACT Act violates the Due Process Clause by broadening jurisdictional reach without considering constraints imposed by due process requirements. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court upheld the preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, stating that a single sale does not establish enough minimum contacts for tax collection duties on an out-of-state seller. The Supreme Court has never determined if a single sale is sufficient for due process. The district court's decision was reasonable on a close legal question, so the case was remanded for trial on the merits. The plaintiff in Musser's, a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's tax-payment requirement. The district court denied the injunction, stating that Congress, not states, imposed the tax requirement on interstate businesses. This decision differed from the Red Earth case analysis, emphasizing the federal nature of the legislation. The court upheld Congress's requirement for farmers and distributors of explosives to comply with state and local laws when selling products. It also determined that businesses engaging in interstate commerce must adhere to state regulations. Additionally, the court found that a plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website. Com, Inc. engages in online business activities that determine personal jurisdiction. The level of interactivity and commercial nature of the website influence jurisdiction. In Musser's case, the plaintiff's website allowed customers to place orders and make payments online, leading to jurisdiction in all 50 states. The court's reasoning suggests that a single sale through an interactive website can satisfy minimum contacts for establishing jurisdiction. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought to challenge the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, finding it timely. The Court highlighted that Due Process and Commerce Clause issues should be treated separately, even with national legislation. The question remains whether national authorization of state levies on e-commerce eliminates concerns about presence and burden. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, finding it timely. The government argued that the PACT Act is a federal law, requiring only minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states. The court distinguished cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions, stating that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The court discussed the PACT Act imposing a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court reviewed key due process cases, including International Shoe Co. v. Washington, to address the government's argument on minimum contacts. The court reviewed key due process cases, including International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, to establish the law on personal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of minimum contacts with the jurisdiction to ensure fair play and substantial justice. Personal jurisdiction can be found if a defendant's actions are purposefully directed towards residents of another state, creating a substantial connection with the forum state. The district court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that a defendant should reasonably anticipate being sued in a forum where their conduct creates a substantial connection. This focus on predictability allows potential defendants to structure their actions with some assurance of where they may be liable to suit. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax. Quill's mail order business had sufficient contacts with North Dakota for due process purposes, unlike in Gordon where the standard was not met. The court in Gordon found that the Quill standard was not met, as there was no purposeful availment of the economic market of the states where products were sold. The district court also questioned the rational connection of the tax on Gordon's products to the values of the taxing state. Due process concerns were raised regarding the lack of protection, opportunities, or benefits provided by the state to Gordon. As a result, the court concluded that the PACT Act may violate due process. The court in Gordon found that the PACT Act may violate due process by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause to tax out-of-state businesses was questioned, as it may not comply with the Due Process Clause. The courts in Red Earth and Gordon analyzed the constitutionality of the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, focusing on the lack of minimum contacts for taxation. The opinion in Musser's may have conflated the Commerce Clause and due process analyses, suggesting that the PACT Act does not implicate due process. The PACT Act's constitutionality under the Due Process Clause is uncertain, as it is unclear if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the minimum contacts requirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Red Earth noted that this issue is a \"close question.\""
