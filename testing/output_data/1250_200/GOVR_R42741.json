    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, with coverage options including individual, family, and self plus one plans. Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with shared premiums between the government and individuals. All plans cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying cost-sharing through deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents with varying cost-sharing options. Prior to FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees had limited health insurance options. President Truman's Commission recommended federal health insurance coverage in 1951, leading to the passage of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA). This act established eligibility parameters, coverage options, and the government's share of premiums. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established eligibility parameters, coverage options, and the government's share of premiums. It also created the Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). FEHBA has been amended multiple times, with changes to the government's share of premiums and expanded eligibility, services, and benefits. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) has seen an increase in the government's share of premiums and expanded eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in modifying FEHB, which is viewed as a successful model for private and public health insurance programs. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of FEHB to other programs like Medicare and expanding access to individuals outside of federal workers and retirees. Policymakers have considered creating new programs based on the FEHB model for small business employees and the uninsured. FEHB has been considered as a model for other health care programs and state-level health insurance exchanges. Congress has a financial interest in FEHB and the authority to restructure it. Congressional policymakers are responsible for FEHB's viability and sustainability. The report provides information on how Congress has interacted with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program in the past, including conditions placed on federal funds, changes to premium share formula, eligibility modifications, and policies affecting Medicare-FEHB relationship. Congress has the authority to restructure FEHB to maintain or improve its function, with examples such as prohibiting federal funds for abortions except in life-threatening situations. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has seen changes over the years, including conditions on federal funds for abortions and adjustments to the government's share of premiums. The provision prohibiting the use of funds for abortions was renewed annually, with exceptions in 1994 and 1995. The government's share of premiums was initially set at 50% and later adjusted based on the average of premiums from six health plans. This formula remained in place with minimal changes until 1997. The government's share of FEHB premiums was initially set at 40% and increased to 50% in 1974. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans. Eligibility for FEHB has been extended over the years to include more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, FEHB was extended to part-time employees, and in 1988 to certain temporary workers. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) allows separated employees to continue FEHB coverage for up to 18 months. TCC enrollees must pay the entire FEHB premium plus a 2% administrative fee. FEHB was established before Medicare, but in 1982 federal workers became eligible for Medicare due to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal workers, outlining eligibility, benefits, premium sharing, and OPM's role. It included current employees, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and family members. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established the FEHB program for federal workers, outlining eligibility, benefits, premium sharing, and OPM's role. Employees and retirees were required to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement or at the earliest opportunity. OPM could contract or approve different types of health benefit plans to participate in FEHB, including Service Benefit Plan, Indemnity Benefit Plan, Employee Organization Plans, and Comprehensive Medical Plans. Comprehensive Medical Plans offer health services on a prepaid basis provided by physicians, with the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans dependent on the type of plan and enrollee. The government's share ranges from 50% of the lowest rate charged by a carrier for certain plans, with specific biweekly government share amounts for different types of coverage. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans ranges from $1.75 to $2.50, with specific percentages based on the type of plan and coverage. Legislation in 1960 and 1963 extended coverage to certain employee groups and allowed for more health benefits plan choices. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was amended by P.L. 88-284 on March 17, 1964. This amendment broadened FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed employees to maintain their FEHB coverage in retirement if enrolled by December 31, 1964. Additionally, OPM was given discretionary authority to terminate FEHB plan contracts with carriers who did not enroll at least 300 employees and retirees. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was further amended by P.L. 88-531 on August 31, 1964. This amendment granted OPM discretionary authority to terminate FEHB plan contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. It also equalized the government's share of premiums for all enrollees, regardless of gender, and extended FEHB coverage to certain United States commissioners and their dependents. P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia who had been temporarily employed for at least two school years. P.L. 89-379 extended FEHB coverage to congressional employees with certain staff fellowships. P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to change the government share of premiums. P.L. 89-504 amended the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program in 1966 to change the government share of premiums, extend coverage for dependent children, and allow employees on leave without pay to maintain coverage. Other acts like P.L. 90-486 and P.L. 90-578 granted FEHB coverage to National Guard technicians and full-time United States magistrates, respectively. P.L. 91-175 and P.L. 91-418 in 1969 and 1970 respectively, allowed federal employees to continue FEHB during transfer to international organizations and adjusted government's share of health benefit premiums. The \"big six\" formula was established to calculate the government's 40% share based on the average of six benefit plans. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments, allowing them to maintain eligibility and coverage. It also provided coverage to noncitizen employees in the Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to U.S. nationals employed by the federal government outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased government's share of FEHB plan premium to 50% in 1974, with a provision to increase to 60% in 1975. Government's share was capped at 75% of total premium. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions on entitlement to benefits. P.L. 93-363 allowed FEHB enrollees direct access to clinical psychologists and optometrists without referral, with payment or reimbursement for services. P.L. 94-310 ensured government's share of health plan premiums for retirees would be available until expended.

Amendments in P.L. 96-179 removed certain requirements for child coverage under FEHB. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) mandated federal employees to pay Medicare tax starting in 1983. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax starting in 1983. This allowed federal employment to count towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. Additionally, Medicare payments became secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. The government was required to pay the difference in health plan premiums for 1983 into contingency reserves of FEHB plans.

It would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were also Medicare eligible, submit a report to Congress on incorporating health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals, and improve program efficiency. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) set provisions for OPM to impose sanctions on healthcare providers convicted of illegal activities, including financial misconduct and abuse of patients.
