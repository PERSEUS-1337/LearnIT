President Clinton organized the first Summit of the Americas in 1994 in Miami, attended by all democratically elected leaders in the region except Fidel Castro. The leaders approved a Plan of Action with initiatives focused on democracy, economic integration, poverty eradication, and environmental conservation. The Miami Summit in 1994 led to the agreement to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005. Subsequent Summits and Special Summits introduced new initiatives, such as the focus on sustainable development in Bolivia in 1996 and education in Chile in 1998. The Quebec City Summit in 2001 emphasized democracy and resulted in the creation of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Another Special Summit in Monterrey in 2004 reaffirmed commitments.

The Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina in 2005 saw protests against President Bush, U.S. military involvement in Iraq, and the FTAA.
