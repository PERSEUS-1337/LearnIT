    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rise in retail drug spending, driven by new drug introductions and price increases. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in drug spending from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other medical spending areas. This report will address government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The report covers federally funded research, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation in prescription drug topics. It references National Health Expenditures data on drug spending, which totaled $328.6 billion in 2016 and is forecasted to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, representing 10% of national healthcare spending. Prescription drug spending is projected to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national healthcare spending. By 2027, it is expected to increase to about 11% of total healthcare spending. Various sources provide estimates on U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use in hospitals. Factors such as rebates, coupons, and inclusion criteria contribute to the varying national estimates. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. has shown a trend towards higher spending in recent years. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, spending grew at a double-digit pace, but slowed from 2003 to 2013 due to various factors. However, spending accelerated in 2014 with a 12.4% increase, followed by an 8.9% increase in 2015. The forecast for 2017 is a 2.9% increase. Retail drug spending in the U.S. rose by 8.9% in 2015, slowed to a 1.3% increase in 2016, and is forecasted to increase by 2.9% in 2017. The NHE projects a 6.3% annual growth through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than physician services and hospital care. Congressional hearings have addressed the rise in drug spending and prices. Retail prescription drug spending is influenced by changes in drug availability, prices, and usage volume. The rapid increase in retail drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases, and the impact of the ACA. Prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to fewer new drug approvals and a decrease in spending for certain therapies. Drug mix refers to the cost difference between new and older drugs, with innovator brand-name drugs being more expensive. The introduction of new, expensive specialty drugs in recent years has driven up prescription drug spending in the U.S. However, the impact of these high-cost drugs is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated with them and net prices drop. At the same time, the introduction of generic drugs, which are more affordable than brand-name products, has helped reduce the cost of certain therapies. Since 2009, generic substitution has played a smaller role in reducing total drug spending as patents for best-selling brand-name drugs expired, allowing for new generic versions. Spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell by $32.6 billion in 2012 during the patent cliff peak. Changes in drug mix will continue to impact spending, especially with the rise of biologics in the development pipeline. Prescription drug prices have outpaced overall U.S. inflation since 2014, but the gap narrowed significantly in 2017. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017. U.S. retail drug inflation, as measured by the CPI-U, was 6.4% in 2014, compared to general consumer inflation of 0.8%. Drug prices rose 6.2% in 2016, compared to a 2.1% consumer inflation rate, and 2.8% in 2017, compared to consumer inflation of 2.1%. Drug inflation has been mainly driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator brand-name drugs. Manufacturers have also raised prices for existing generic drugs in recent years. Brand-name drugs saw a 10.7% price increase from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7% during the same period. Biologics and specialty drugs have been major contributors to the price inflation. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for drugs, with a nearly 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid coverage expansion under the ACA also led to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging population, particularly patients aged 50 and older, accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. According to IQVIA, patients aged 50 and older made up 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016 and 77% of the increase in drug dispensing since 2011. Out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions has decreased over the years, with a forecast of 12.1% in 2026. Consumer cost sharing represents a smaller share of overall prescription drug spending, but consumers can still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on various factors. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending. From 2012 to 2015, the share of plans with a drug deductible rose to 46% from 23%. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs are becoming more common, putting a financial burden on consumers. For example, consumers may pay a $10 co-payment for a generic drug but 30% coinsurance for a specialty drug. The widening price tiers in health plans are increasing financial burdens on consumers, with higher-priced drugs costing significantly more than generic drugs. Despite some cost-sharing increases, developments like the ACA and patient assistance programs have helped moderate the impact. While average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased, the number of consumers facing high costs for specialty drugs or serious conditions has risen. The number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs has increased in recent years. A 2016 study found that while average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased, nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rising by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs is forecasted to gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs is forecasted to decrease from $140 in 2016 to $137 in 2017, then gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending is expected to rise from 44.1% in 2017 to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits. The U.S. does not have a centralized system for setting drug prices. Federal agencies operate various drug discount and contracting systems, with FDA regulating drug safety. Congress has not given FDA authority to set drug prices. Medicaid rebates were 47% of spending in 2012, while Part D rebates were 15%. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from interfering in these negotiations. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created Medicare Part D with a noninterference provision. This provision prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations between Part D plan sponsors, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with total Part D drug rebates rising from 9.6% in 2007 to a forecasted 24% in 2018. Studies have shown that Part D premiums are lower in areas with robust competition among plans, but Part D plans have higher average drug prices than Medicaid. Some lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, citing potential for larger discounts. In 2007, a bill allowing negotiation of Part D drug prices was approved by the House but not the Senate. Concerns exist about giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary, as it could lead to reductions in drug coverage. Several proposals have been introduced to modify the noninterference provision in Medicare Part D, including giving the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs. The Trump Administration has suggested requiring Part D plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have also considered applying Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to the CBO. However, savings could diminish over time as drug manufacturers may increase prices in response. The CBO warned that savings from Medicare Part D brand-name drugs could decrease over time due to price increases by manufacturers. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, with some offering patient assistance programs. Various states are implementing measures to limit spending on high-priced drugs and increase transparency in drug prices, such as setting cost-sharing caps and requiring manufacturer disclosure for drugs with significant price increases. The Vermont law requires manufacturer disclosure for drugs with large price increases, forcing them to justify the price hikes to the state attorney general. Other states are also implementing measures to increase transparency in drug prices, such as prohibiting gag clauses in pharmacy contracts and allowing importation of prescription drugs from certain countries. The United States spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations. The United States spends significantly more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with projections showing a rise in the U.S. share of global drug spending. Studies have found that U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs is much higher than the OECD average, with prices for specific drugs often double that of the European Union. Various reasons have been suggested for the higher spending and prices in the U.S., including faster adoption of new drugs. Studies have posited reasons for higher U.S. spending on prescription drugs, including faster adoption of new drugs and market exclusivity for manufacturers. OECD countries may have government-run healthcare systems that set price limits, while Canada uses value-based pricing. U.S. payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models. The U.S. government and commercial payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models for prescription drugs, including value-based purchasing. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care announced a deal with drugmakers for discounts based on health outcomes. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review is producing reports on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. ICER refines methodology for valuing prescription drugs, government focuses on basic research, pharmaceutical industry on clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging. Studies show majority of new drugs approved originate from private industry. A 2011 study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review were a result of publicly funded research. The FDA granted priority review to 348 out of 1,541 total drug applications, with 19% resulting from publicly funded research. Public-sector research institutions (PSRIs) had a higher percentage of new-drug applications receiving priority reviews compared to private-sector research. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with significant clinical effects, according to the authors. The 2011 Stevens study defined PSRIs' participation in drug discovery based on creating intellectual property transferred to a company through a commercial license. The Stevens study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds from the evaluation of new drug development, as these technologies were not used to develop specific drug candidates. These technologies included recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods. Excluding these technologies may have significantly impacted the economic outlook for drug development. A 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every one of the 210 new drug approvals by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study revealed that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, totaling about $100 billion, contributed to research that led to these new drug approvals. This suggests that the NIH's impact on new drug research is greater than previously recognized. The cost of developing a new FDA-approved prescription drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. This figure is based on data from large drug manufacturers and is higher than previous estimates. The 2014 Tufts study estimated the cost of drug development at $802 million in 2013 dollars, but academic and government research has challenged this figure. A 2016 HHS study noted that costs for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are highly sensitive to factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs. Transparency legislation may compel drugmakers to provide data on research and marketing costs for high-priced drugs. Several state legislatures are considering price transparency legislation that would require drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Studies have shown that research and development costs are not always the main factor in drug pricing decisions. For example, investigations into drugs like Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Ibrance revealed that pricing strategies were focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. The main factors influencing the list price of the Pfizer breast cancer drug Ibrance include the prices of existing drugs in the same category, potential reimbursement from insurance companies and federal programs, and feedback from prescribers. The United States and New Zealand are the only nations allowing direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance in the information provided. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses from their federal taxes, with DTC advertising being just one aspect of their promotional efforts. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when FDA gained authority over prescription drug advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising expanded steadily, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. Advertising dipped during the 2007 recession but rebounded in 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in recent years, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. According to Kantar Media, pharmaceutical advertising increased by 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. The majority of spending on pharmaceutical DTC advertising is on television and newspaper ads, but internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area. Federal regulations require drug companies to submit ads to the FDA for assessment. Internet prescription drug promotions are increasing, while television promotions remain flat. Pharmaceutical advertising contributes to more informed consumers, but critics argue it may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. New brand-name drugs with higher prices may not offer significant additional benefits compared to existing treatments. Studies show a link between drug advertising and increased prescription drug use. A 2015 study found that increased drug advertising leads to more filled prescriptions. Government reports suggest that advertising may promote inappropriate drug use. Public opinion shows concerns about lack of information in DTC ads. The debate on restricting DTC drug ads aims to protect public health and finances. Medical associations have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. Constitutional issues may arise due to First Amendment protection of commercial speech. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on DTC drug ads. In the past, courts have ruled that product advertisements are protected by the First Amendment as \"commercial speech.\" Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impose a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Concerns persist about the promotion of new drugs to consumers without sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine recommended a two-year restriction on DTC advertising of new drugs in 2006. Congress has debated but not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Additionally, lawmakers introduced legislation to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Without an approved marketing application, manufacturers may not advertise new drugs. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States. The requirements for marketing approval in the US are detailed and explicit, including clinical data, manufacturing procedures, and labeling. No drug imported by a consumer would technically meet all approval elements. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (MEDS Act) of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but it has not been implemented due to the HHS Secretary not certifying its safety and cost benefits. The provision was included in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003, but no certifications have been made, prohibiting importation of prescription drugs from abroad. The PDMA, MEDS Act, and MMA legislation addressed importation of prescription drugs from abroad by entities other than the manufacturer. Lawmakers have attempted to allow importation through the agriculture appropriations bill, but FDA enforcement of personal importation restrictions has been lenient. Individuals have been allowed to bring a small amount of prescription drugs into the United States. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The policy aims to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not available in the US, but it does not cover foreign-made versions of drugs available domestically. The FDA's lenient enforcement of personal importation restrictions allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation for lower prices. The Senate has held hearings on sudden price spikes in decades-old Rx drugs and off-patent drugs, as well as examining the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and the cost of prescription drugs according to a report by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The Senate has conducted hearings on the cost of prescription drugs and regulatory barriers affecting pharmaceutical competition. The FDA's progress report on biosimilar implementation and hearings on drug supply chain, 340B drug pricing program, patient access to investigational drugs, and FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs have been conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs is being examined by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in various sessions. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has held hearings on various topics related to the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces, federally funded cancer research, voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, rising prices of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market."
