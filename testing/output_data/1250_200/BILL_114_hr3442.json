The \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015\" mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress 60-21 days before the public debt reaches the specified limit. The report must include details on the public debt, Federal revenue levels, and future debt projections. The \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015\" requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on various aspects related to the public debt, including income taxes as a percentage of GDP, future debt drivers, meeting debt obligations, reduction measures if the debt limit is not raised, and the possibility of a balanced budget amendment. The \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015\" aims to adopt a balanced budget amendment to control future debt accumulation. It includes detailed explanations of the President's proposals to reduce public debt in the short, medium, and long term, the impact of an increased debt limit on government spending, projections of fiscal health for major entitlement programs, and the President's weekly plan. The \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015\" requires the President to disclose reduction measures used to avoid defaulting on government obligations when the debt limit is reached. This includes details on the total dollar amount of measures used and estimates for future use, along with a timeline for when all reduction measures will be exhausted. The Secretary must provide details on when the Government will begin defaulting on its obligations if reduction measures are exhausted, any extraordinary measures planned to fund government obligations, and a projection of how long these measures will last. Additionally, the report must address the Administration's capability to pay only principal and interest on the national debt if the debt limit is reached. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide a detailed progress report on implementing the President's proposals, with exceptions for repeat appearances. The report, along with other relevant information, must be made accessible to the public on the Department of the Treasury's website for at least 6 months. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide information on reduction measures, including directing debt issuance, suspending investments, and selling assets. This is to help the public understand the statutory debt limit and government debt. The Secretary of the Treasury can take various reduction measures, such as selling assets or suspending investments, to manage the statutory debt limit and government debt. This includes actions like selling securities before maturity and other appropriate measures determined by the Secretary. The House of Representatives passed a report on reaching the debt limit on February 11, 2016, attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
