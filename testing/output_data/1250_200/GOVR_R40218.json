    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. Despite these efforts, research shows that foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood. Research shows that former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including lower rates of higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public support. Policy makers have focused on providing support for youth after they reach the age of majority to help ease this transition. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was passed to address these issues. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) are significant laws that address issues affecting older youth in foster care. These laws aim to protect older youth, promote normalcy, and respond to sex trafficking. Implementation of these laws is crucial for older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood. The implementation of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183 is crucial for older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood. States may face challenges in extending foster care to older youth due to cost concerns. States are required to assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care to provide necessary supports and services. Despite the option to extend foster care, concerns remain about the challenges older foster youth face during the transition to adulthood. Policy makers and advocates are concerned about challenges faced by older foster youth and those who have aged out during the transition to adulthood. Emancipated youth struggle with forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database will provide insight into outcomes for youth transitioning from foster care in areas like education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. There is also a concern about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, with P.L. 113-183 requiring child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor state implementation of these requirements and identify best practices for serving victims. The report discusses the declining number of children in foster care over the past decade, with older children making up a larger share of the caseload. In FY2002, approximately 523,000 children were in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. Children aged 13-17 comprised about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, increasing to 35% in FY2010 before dropping to 34% in FY2012. Over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care in FY2002, accounting for 7% of all children in care. In FY2002, over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. This number increased in subsequent years, reaching a peak of slightly more than 26,000 youth in FY2010. However, the number of youth emancipating dropped to 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin at different data collection waves. The most recent results show that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. For example, they were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree. Barriers to education included financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Despite this, former foster youth were almost as likely to have held a job as youth in general. Former foster youth face challenges in education and employment, with lower rates of college degree attainment and barriers such as financial constraints and transportation issues. While they were almost as likely to have held a job as youth in general, a smaller share are currently employed with a lower mean annual income. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes, using federal and state funds to facilitate successful reunification or find a permanent safe home. Eligibility for federal funds requires states to promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all children in foster care through written case plans. States must agree to carry out activities to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care. This includes having a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services for a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed regularly, with specific procedures for older youth in care. For youth aged 14 and older, the plan must include programs for transitioning to adulthood. The state child welfare agency is required to consult with the child in an age-appropriate manner during any permanency hearing. The state child welfare agency is required to include in a child's case plan certain rights for those in foster care at age 14 or older, including education, health, visitation, and court participation. The child must also be consulted in the development of their case plan and permanency plan, with the option to choose up to two members of the planning teams. One selected individual can act as the child's advisor and advocate. The state child welfare agency must include certain rights in a child's case plan at age 14 or older, such as education and health. The child can choose advisors and advocates for their case plan. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares youth for leaving state custody. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act resulted from reforms to the child welfare system by the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress enacted the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, which made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes. It allows states to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, and the 113th Congress passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act to protect older youth in care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, enacted by the 110th Congress, allows states to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, passed by the 113th Congress, provides protections for older youth in care and requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children. Funding for Title IV-E foster care program is available on an open-ended entitlement basis, reimbursing states for eligible expenditures on behalf of eligible children. Title IV-E foster care eligibility requires the child to be in state care, meet certain criteria, and be placed in a licensed setting with a provider. The state must provide a maintenance payment for the child's care and safety, covering expenses like food, clothing, and shelter. The federal reimbursement for foster care covers expenses such as food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, and travel. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety and well-being for all youth in care. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until the child turns 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States and tribes can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older who are Title IV-E eligible and are completing high school, enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or have a medical condition preventing them from working or attending school. The law allows for federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care facilities. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth aged 18 or older who remain in care and live in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. A child care institution is defined as a facility for no more than 25 children, excluding detention facilities or training schools. Beginning in FY2011, states may also seek reimbursement for youth placed in supervised settings living independently. HHS encourages states to extend foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with a rationale required if extending to a lower age. States are encouraged to extend foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with a rationale required if extending to a lower age. The state or tribe must submit a description as part of their Title IV-E plan, which outlines how they administer programs under Title IV-E. Funding is contingent upon an approved plan, and criteria must be established to determine if youth meet employment or education conditions. States and tribes must also verify that youth continue to meet the conditions to remain in care. Examples of education or employment activities for youth in extended care include finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. HHS advises states and tribes to establish requirements for extended foster care, such as enrollment in post-secondary education. Program instructions address criteria for Title IV-E foster care eligibility for youth reaching the state age of majority. Youth in extended foster care must meet Title IV-E requirements for federal foster care eligibility, regardless of their parents' or legal guardians' status. Court orders or voluntary placement agreements are necessary for youth entering or reentering care. Removal criteria for youth over 18 are based on the welfare of the youth. The instructions for youth in extended foster care, age 18 or older, involve court determinations or voluntary placement agreements for their welfare. State and tribal agencies must follow placement and care rules, including supervised independent living or foster family placements. The program instructions for supervised independent living settings under Title IV-E foster care maintenance allow states and tribes to develop various types of settings, such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Youth in these settings should have opportunities to form connections with caring adults through guardianship arrangements, adoption, or living with caring adults. The program instructions for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments allow for payments to be made directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes are advised to apply the same case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care as they do for children under 18, focusing on the youth's needs and safety in their placement. Permanency plans should be finalized every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered care. States and tribes are advised to make reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered care, with the plan reflecting the goal of emancipation or independence. The court can determine the plan without a hearing if authorized. Youth ineligible for federal foster care do not require IV-E requirements, but those under 18 or completing school still do. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions had extended the maximum age of foster care to 21 for youth receiving federal foster care maintenance payments. Approved plans for 18 states and the District of Columbia included extending care until age 21, except for Indiana and Nebraska which extended care to age 20 and 19, respectively. Nebraska had enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to 21, pending HHS review. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend foster care until age 21, pending HHS review. Except for three states, jurisdictions with approved plan amendments allow youth to remain in care under specific conditions. Other states considering extending care need to evaluate outcomes, costs, eligible youth, court oversight, rethinking extended care, older youth reentry, and youth in care. The research literature on youth who emancipate from care\u2014or stay in care beyond age 18\u2014is scarce. The Midwest Evaluation study demonstrated that youth who remained in care as late as age 20 tended to have more positive outcomes than those who emancipated at age 18. Remaining in care was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. The Midwest Evaluation study showed that youth who remained in care until age 21 had higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after 18 was linked to a $470 increase in annual earnings. Youth in care were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. They also received more transitional living services compared to their peers. The study found that youth who remained in care until age 21 were more likely to have received transitional living services funded through the CFCIP. By age 23, these young people were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree. Challenges exist in extending care due to fiscal constraints and competing budgetary considerations. States face challenges in extending care due to budget constraints. In a 2014 GAO review, 17 states cited budget constraints as the main reason for not extending federal foster care. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests steps for states to consider when deciding to extend care, including convening a planning group, reviewing federal requirements, considering existing supports, projecting costs, and considering next steps. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies on extending care. Researchers calculated the costs of extending care based on Illinois' experience, estimating an annual cost of about $20,800. The cost of extending foster care beyond age 18 in Illinois is estimated to be around $20,800 annually, with potential benefits for youth in terms of increased earnings from attending college. The analysis shows an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in an additional $72,000 earned over their lifetime. However, the analysis did not consider the costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, nor did it explore potential societal benefits like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. The cost of providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a consideration for most states. Just under half of children meet the criteria for federal foster care maintenance payments, with state expenditures only partially reimbursed by the federal government. Eligibility for Title IV-E involves income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is discussed. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, ranging from 50% to 73%. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to the high costs involved. Extending care only to certain eligible youth may raise equity concerns. States are expected to cover the full costs for children who do not meet the Title IV-E eligibility criteria. Under law, extending care only to certain youth who meet eligibility criteria may raise equity concerns. States could establish different levels of reimbursement and services for Title IV-E eligible youth who remain in care after age 18. Eligible youth must undertake certain activities to remain in care, but some states restrict eligibility based on specific activities, potentially raising equity concerns. Youth may choose different pathways, such as work or college, which states should consider when determining eligibility. Federal child welfare law gives state courts a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of their eligibility for IV-E funding or how they entered care. Regular case reviews are required to assess progress and ensure the child's well-being. The court plays a vital role in reviewing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of IV-E eligibility. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of foster care placement, with regular reviews every 12 months. HHS guidelines ensure all children under 18 are protected by the case review system. Children who are ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to court oversight, consistent with Departmental policy. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under voluntary placement agreements, but case reviews must be conducted every six months. Non-IV-E eligible youth may receive different levels of services and supports, with potentially less oversight and supervision compared to IV-E eligible youth. This lack of information on IV-E ineligible youth may hinder policymakers from making informed decisions. The American Bar Association recommends extending juvenile court jurisdiction beyond age 18 for youth in care, ensuring accountability and involvement of older youth in their hearings. Foster care for young adults aged 18 and older should provide tailored support services. Some stakeholders advocate for reimagining foster care for youth aged 18 and older to provide more appropriate support as they transition out of the system. The Jim Casey Foundation emphasizes the need for tailored services to help these young adults successfully navigate the challenges of aging out of foster care. Extended care for youth aged 18 and older should be developmentally appropriate, taking into account their trauma and neurological growth. Research shows that young adults need strong social supports, opportunities to learn from mistakes, and skills for healthy relationships. Permanent connections and family engagement are also crucial in extended care. Extended care for youth aged 18 and older should focus on assisting them in maintaining permanent connections and developing skills for healthy relationships. This approach emphasizes the youth's autonomy in choosing who they want to connect with and may involve graduated levels of supervision and support. Case planning may be redesigned to involve the youth in decision-making and building social networks. Research also looks into factors that help youth remain in extended care, despite challenges in some areas like Illinois. In Illinois, a significant number of youth do not stay in care despite state policies to retain them beyond age 18. The Cook County region has a higher retention rate compared to the other regions. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 include varying understanding of laws and policies, active involvement of some juvenile courts, and lack of uniformity among stakeholders in the child welfare system. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 include varying understanding of laws and policies, lack of appropriate foster care placements, and youth attitudes towards staying in care. Stable relationships with adults can help youth remain in care longer. These factors may be relevant to other states that do not extend care beyond age 18. The July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS allow states to extend foster care assistance for youth who emancipate from foster care and later wish to return due to challenges faced living independently. States can permit youth to stay in care continuously or leave and return after age 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21, depending on the state's policies. The Government Accountability Office found that 19 states have policies enabling young people to leave and re-enter care, with 12 states allowing youth to stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. States can extend foster care assistance for youth who emancipate from foster care and wish to return due to challenges faced living independently. The law allows for youth to live in supervised independent living settings after age 18, with the child welfare agency providing supervision. However, there is no clear guidance on oversight of youth in these settings, leading to potential variations in protocols across states. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning essential life skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues to ensure the well-being of these individuals. States with foster youth in independent living settings must address several key issues: Should the child welfare agency purchase or contract for independent living units? How should screening of other residents be handled? What portion of rent and utilities should youth cover? How often should case workers visit? What happens if youth violate lease terms? Can they move to different settings based on progress? How should maintenance payments be managed? What support is available for youth transitioning back to a guardian's home? In a 2014 GAO survey of 19 states with extended care for foster youth, all but two reported providing supervised independent living settings. States face challenges in finding suitable housing options for these youth. Minnesota allows youth in extended care to live in various settings like apartments, homes, and dorms. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Independent living settings do not require licensing, and counties have discretion in handling background checks for roommates and safety concerns. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, up to their 21st birthday if they are enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. Assistance can also be extended to older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from participating in these activities. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children up to their 21st birthday if they are enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. Assistance can also be extended to older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from participating in these activities. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth aging out of foster care, helping them transition to self-sufficiency, obtain employment, and access postsecondary education. The program also offers personal and emotional support through mentors and adults, as well as assistance for former foster youth ages 18 to 21 to achieve self-sufficiency. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth aging out of foster care through mentors and dedicated adults, helping them achieve self-sufficiency in employment, education, and housing. It also emphasizes personal responsibility for transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to provide independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) added a purpose area to ensure children in foster care until 18 engage in appropriate activities. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million, allocated based on states' foster care population. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides funding to states and tribes for independent living programs for youth aging out of foster care. States receive funding based on their share of the foster care population, with a minimum amount set. States must provide a 20% match and develop programs that offer various services to youth. To be eligible for CFCIP funds, states and tribes must outline their independent living program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan. This program aims to support youth in achieving self-sufficiency in areas such as housing, education, and employment. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth aging out of foster care to attend higher education. The program is funded by Congress with approximately $45 million allocated each year. The vouchers cover tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, and related expenses. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers for eligible foster youth to attend higher education. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. Independent living services may be available to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. States have discretion in defining when foster youth can remain in care until age 18. They must prioritize which youth to serve in independent living programs and ensure they participate in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare law requires caseworkers to assist youth in developing a transition plan, including options for housing, education, mentors, and employment services, to be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes provisions for health care decision-making and the option to execute legal documents. It is separate from the case plan but complements it by addressing key aspects of the youth's future. The case plan for youth in foster care describes placement and care, while the transition plan focuses on services for when the youth is no longer in custody. The transition plan includes options for housing and independent living, directed by the youth with input from others. The transition plan for youth in foster care is directed by the youth with input from others and can be as detailed as desired. It is not reviewed by a court but is guided by HHS program instructions to assist young people in transitioning from foster care. Agencies are encouraged to engage youth in the transition planning process well in advance, especially for those who emancipate at age 17. Thousands of youth emancipate from care at age 17, potentially leaving them less prepared than their peers who emancipate at older ages. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth who leave care just before turning 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance on creating transition plans that focus on engaging youth and stakeholders, prioritizing permanency with caring adults, and considering the strengths of the young people involved. The guidance emphasizes developing transition plans for youth with their strengths in mind, ensuring active participation, and involving service providers and stakeholders. States have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning, document youth input, provide essential supports, and appoint specialists to assist with the plan. However, some jurisdictions face challenges such as lack of staff training or time for effective youth engagement. Several jurisdictions face challenges with transition planning, including a lack of staff training or time to effectively engage youth, identifying and engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for youth transitioning from care. Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes, such as holding \"circles\" in Hawaii to celebrate the young person becoming an adult and assisting with future planning. Foster Club in Nebraska has created a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, including a transition proposal checklist and a \"permanency pact\" to assist youth as they transition to adulthood. Despite policy changes, concerns remain about the challenges faced by older foster youth and those who have aged out, such as difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections with caring adults, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. The effectiveness of services they receive and outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and criminal justice systems are being monitored through a national database. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, including those at risk of going missing or being victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. The Midwest Evaluation shows that youth aging out of foster care struggle with maintaining positive relationships with adults and have complex relationships with their biological families. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth reveals that youth emancipated from care have complex relationships with their biological families. At age 26, they are more likely to be married but less likely to live with their parents. Many alumni report not being close to their biological family members, indicating a need for stronger connections after leaving care. Despite federal protections, there is a call for additional policies to improve the transition to adulthood for youth in foster care. Futures, child welfare practitioners, and young people in care advocate for policies improving the transition to adulthood by fostering strong connections to caring adults. These connections can provide emotional, financial, and other support for youth in foster care. The child welfare agency in some areas actively ensures permanent adult connections for youth aging out, aiming for safe, stable, and secure relationships with committed adults. Practitioners suggest ways to help youth achieve permanency, such as reconsidering case goals, identifying permanent connections, pursuing adoptive relationships, and developing caring relationships. Child welfare researchers caution against fostering unsustainable relationships for youth in care. Advocates recommend initiating permanency planning before youth leave care, ensuring lasting connections with adults. Little research exists on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. Policy makers and practitioners are urged to prioritize permanency planning through the case planning process. At a child's annual permanency hearing, the judge determines the permanency plan for the child, which can include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these options are feasible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen with a compelling reason. APPLA was introduced in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to provide a stable permanent arrangement for children in foster care, not as a temporary solution. Advocates emphasize the importance of a specific adult or couple providing a permanency plan with APPLA for young people in foster care. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is sometimes used as a default goal, replacing long-term foster care. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth highlighted the need for improved outcomes and better understanding of permanency goals for children in foster care. The white paper suggested two policy options related to APPLA: eliminating it as a case plan goal or restricting it to older teenagers after intensive family finding efforts. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA, with different effective dates based on tribal responsibility. Additional requirements must be met if APPLA is assigned as a permanency plan. The law requires additional requirements for children with an APPLA permanency plan during annual hearings and periodic reviews in foster care. The transition plan aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering mentoring opportunities. Changes to federal child welfare law may assist youth in achieving permanency. Changes to federal child welfare law could include amending case plan requirements to ensure youth have a permanent living arrangement after leaving care. States like Texas focus on helping youth establish adult connections for support during the transition process. In Texas, youth aging out of care receive assistance in identifying caring adults for support. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps establish lifelong connections for youth leaving care. Efforts also focus on adoption for older youth, with projects like Adoption Opportunity Grants supporting open adoption and contact with biological families. The grants funded 10 projects nationwide to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for youth. Federal grants could fund mentoring programs for foster children, with legislation introduced in Congress for this purpose. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety, well-being, and permanency of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking. Child victims of sex trafficking may come to the attention of child welfare agencies through the CPS hotline. Children in foster care, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are vulnerable to trafficking, especially those who run away. State and local agencies may have limited capacity to respond due to training, resources, and high caseloads. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration and information sharing to address child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration and information sharing to address child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for child victims of sex trafficking. Hearings in the 113th Congress discussed the challenges and opportunities for child welfare agencies in combating child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to establish procedures for identifying and assisting child victims of sex trafficking. These procedures must be developed in collaboration with various stakeholders and include training for caseworkers. State agencies are required to report cases to law enforcement promptly and provide annual reports to HHS on the number of child victims within specified timeframes. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to report annually to HHS the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims. HHS is required to report to Congress and the public the number of victims identified by state agencies. Additionally, HHS must submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide services for victims within two years of the bill's enactment. The law also establishes the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking to advise the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on improving the response to domestic sex trafficking of minors. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report annually to HHS the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims. HHS is required to report to Congress and the public the number of victims identified by state agencies. Congress may wish to monitor how states implement these requirements when they go into effect one to four years after the law's enactment. Key considerations include the type of guidance and technical assistance provided by HHS to states, serving youth not previously in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and identifying best practices for serving victims. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth victims already in the child welfare system. Pending legislation like H.R. 5081 would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving them. Child welfare stakeholders seek more uniform support for children in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies on responding to children missing from care, requiring them to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care. The Child Welfare League of America conducted a survey in 2004, revealing that many states have policies in place to prevent children from going missing from foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, including addressing factors contributing to their disappearance and reporting information to relevant authorities. This must be done within one year of the law's enactment. Additionally, agencies are required to report information on missing children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement for inclusion in the FBI's database. Children missing from care raise issues about the role of child welfare agencies and the federal government in responding. Best practice guidelines recommend procedures for state child welfare agencies, including workforce training, involving stakeholders in decision-making, examining facilities with high runaway rates, and taking corrective action. States need to define missing children and consider reporting to law enforcement agencies. Children missing from care raise questions about reporting to law enforcement agencies. States may need to restrict reporting to cases where law enforcement can be most helpful due to competing demands and limited resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, for various reasons. The frustration of runaway cases involving juveniles who do not want to return home and the risk of endangerment even when their whereabouts are known. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy and guidelines from CWLA and NCMEC emphasize the importance of collaboration and clear definitions for missing children. Limited information is available on children missing from foster care, with state agencies required to report to HHS on runaways from foster care placements. Child welfare agencies track children who run away from foster care placements, but may not report on children missing for other reasons. Stakeholders are concerned about restrictions on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. Witnesses testified about the limitations foster youth face in a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing. Witnesses testified about the restrictions foster youth face, such as being prevented from normal activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and participating in sports. They highlighted that youth naturally seek independence and may engage in risky behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addresses promoting normalcy for youth in foster care by establishing a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for caregivers. HHS is tasked with helping states identify best practices for implementing this standard, and child welfare agencies must provide training to prospective foster parents on children's developmental stages. States are required to determine if foster children's participation in activities is age-appropriate and update licensing standards for foster homes. Concerns exist about housing for youth aging out of foster care, with studies showing varying rates of homelessness. Former foster youth often experience homelessness or couch surfing due to lack of permanent housing. Former foster youth often struggle with housing instability, leading to homelessness or couch surfing. Factors such as lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system contribute to their housing challenges. While states can allocate funds for room and board, it may not be sufficient. Nonprofit organizations and housing programs may provide support, but the housing market's affordability remains a barrier for many former foster youth. Former foster youth may access housing programs operated by nonprofit organizations, often in partnership with housing developers or property management agencies. A review of 60 programs in 21 states and D.C. found options like single-site locations, scattered-site housing, and host homes. These programs focus on independent living support, requiring youth to work or attend school. However, none have been rigorously evaluated for preventing homelessness or improving outcomes like high school diploma attainment. States offering extended foster care under P.L. 110-351 can place youth in foster homes or independent living, but face challenges in finding suitable housing options. States face challenges in finding appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth, especially during college breaks when facilities are closed. Some states, like California, require public universities to provide housing for emancipated foster youth. The Higher Education Act addresses housing concerns by authorizing services for youth in foster care, including temporary housing during academic breaks. The Higher Education Act authorizes Student Support Services to provide temporary housing for disadvantaged college students during breaks. Funds from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education can also be used for demonstration projects offering support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. Additionally, owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits can designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care are at higher risk of disconnection. Those who aged out of care have low employment rates and earnings. A study in three states showed that at age 24, only three out of five aged-out youth were employed, lower than the national average and youth from low-income families. At age 24, three out of five youth who aged out in three states were working, with lower earnings compared to their counterparts nationally. Young people in care or who have aged out face challenges in education, such as multiple school placements and lack of consistent education support. By age 26, only about 7% of aged-out youth in three states attained a degree, suggesting they may need additional support to complete their education. Young foster care alumni may require additional support to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance. Federal and state child welfare laws address the educational needs of youth in foster care, ensuring considerations for school proximity, educational records in case plans, and continuity in school enrollment. The law ensures that foster care children remain in their current school or are promptly enrolled in a new school if it is in their best interest. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin.\" Educational records must be updated and provided to foster care parents. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education convened a summit in November 2011 to discuss promoting educational stability and improving outcomes for children in foster care. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for foster care children through amendments to federal education law. For example, S. 1094 would require state education agencies to ensure foster care children remain in their current school. The bill aims to ensure educational stability for children in foster care by requiring state education agencies to keep them in the same school or facilitate immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. It also mandates policies for transferring school credits and receiving partial credit. Federal education law addresses postsecondary needs of foster youth through Trio programs offering supportive services like mentoring and tutoring. The Trio programs provide support services for disadvantaged post-secondary students, including mentoring and tutoring. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form for foster care applicants. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funds independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out, but little is known about their effectiveness or outcomes after leaving care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funds independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out, but little is known about their effectiveness or outcomes after leaving care. The program is the only dedicated source of funding for transition-age young people in and recently emancipated from foster care, with an annual appropriation of $140 million distributed to states based on their relative share of children in care. States must provide a 20% match to receive the funds. Based on a 2008 survey, most states spend additional funds beyond the required match to provide independent living services to youth in care. Federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to carry out their independent living programs effectively. Research on independent living programs is limited, but evaluations have been conducted to determine their effectiveness. The Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs assessed the impact of independent living programs on foster youth outcomes such as education, employment, interpersonal skills, pregnancy rates, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth in California and Massachusetts were randomly assigned to different programs and surveyed at three points over two years. Interviews were conducted with youth, program administrators, and community advocates to gather data. The evaluation team conducted interviews and focus groups with youth, program administrators, and community advocates to assess the impact of independent living programs on foster youth outcomes. The evaluation found no significant impacts in Los Angeles and Kern County programs, but the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care showed positive impacts on education outcomes. The Outreach program helps youth prepare for independent living and establish permanent connections with caring adults. The Outreach program aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding risky behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services with a focus on youth development, where social workers oversee a small caseload and build close relationships with the youth. Caseworkers assist with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and finding employment. The evaluation showed that Outreach youth were more likely to enroll in college compared to their counterparts in the control group. The Outreach program helps young people transition to adulthood by providing support in education, employment, and housing. Outreach youth were more likely to enroll and persist in college, stay in foster care, and receive assistance in various areas. However, the program did not show significant improvements in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or independent living preparedness. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The evaluation questions the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program, while promising, did not show significant improvements in various areas for transitioning youth. The National Youth in Transition Database aims to track outcomes of foster youth but states have reported limited information to the database. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to develop outcome measures for assessing state performance in independent living programs for youth in foster care. States began collecting data on youth in FY2011, reporting information twice a year on those receiving independent living services. States collect data on eligible youth receiving independent living services twice a year, tracking their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. Financial penalties are imposed on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
