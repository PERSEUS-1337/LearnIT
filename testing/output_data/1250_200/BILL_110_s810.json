    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that to remain competitive in the global economy, the United States must increase the number of high school students prepared for postsecondary education in STEM fields. There is consensus in the scientific community that hands-on laboratory experience is essential for learning science, but the quality of these experiences is currently poor for most students. The lack of agreement on defining high school science labs and their purpose hinders research on improving them. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found disparities in laboratory facilities in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. College students leaving science fields cited issues with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience. Investing in research projects to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools is deemed a national interest. The grant program aims to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools, addressing disparities in facilities and lack of experience cited by college students leaving science fields. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance laboratories and provide instrumentation in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program to enhance laboratories and provide instrumentation for mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for equipment, maintenance, teacher training, and instructional program development. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program to enhance laboratories and provide instrumentation for mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. This includes training in laboratory safety, hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in STEM fields, and assessment of funded activities. The pilot program established by the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 aims to improve laboratories and provide equipment for STEM education at secondary schools. Grants are awarded to partnerships involving higher education institutions, local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal government covers a portion of the costs for activities funded by these grants. The cost of activities funded by grants under the pilot program shall not exceed 50 percent. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results, best practices, and materials developed by grant awardees will be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 5 years. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for the following 3 years."
