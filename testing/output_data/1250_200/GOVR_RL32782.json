    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" plan to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The plan aimed to amend the Clean Air Act by implementing emission caps on electric utility emissions through a tradeable allowance program. Introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, a modified version (S. 131) was later introduced in the 109th Congress. The focus of debate has been on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme, with the EPA stating it would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions at a lower cost compared to command and control measures. The \"Clear Skies\" proposal aims to guarantee emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury at a lower cost through a cap-and-trade program. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions and has proposed similar regulations for SO2 and NOx reductions. The proposal also includes provisions to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected sources opting into the program. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations under the Clean Air Act for affected sources opting into the program. EPA Administrator Whitman suggested that regulations like New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain could be combined into one simplified regulatory process. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act structure is examined. The report examines the potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the structure of the Clean Air Act, particularly focusing on electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Changes proposed by Clear Skies would affect Title I of the Act, with distinctions based on factors like location, age of facility, and fuel type. Despite amendments in 1990, the original regulatory structure from 1970 remains the foundation of the Act. Title IV in 1990 did not change the basic requirements of the Clean Air Act; it was a supplemental provision. The Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and required national emission limits for new polluting facilities. NAAQS are federally enforceable with specific deadlines for compliance, but states are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs). State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are responsible for implementing NAAQS by reducing emissions from existing facilities. New sources must use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent emission increases. Existing sources in nonattainment areas install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) set emission limits for major new stationary sources. EPA has NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10 for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The Clean Air Act establishes mechanisms for addressing interstate pollution, including regional commissions and state petitions. The NOx SIP Call controls NOx emissions in 20 states and the District of Columbia through emission budgets. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program to address the ozone problem in the eastern United States. The 1977 Clean Air Act expanded air quality control measures with the addition of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with stricter limits for historic or recreation areas. New sources are subject to NSPS requirements, while existing sources in nonattainment areas must meet NAAQS controls determined by the state. The Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program classifies areas based on degradation levels, with Class I allowing very little degradation and Class II allowing moderate degradation. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, which permits degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas undergo preconstruction review and must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). BACT is determined by state permitting agencies on a case-by-case basis and must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS. The regional haze program focuses on preventing and remedying visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by manmade air pollution. The Clean Air Act includes requirements for controlling pollutants that impair visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. This includes installing Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources built between 1962 and 1977. The EPA also established a regional haze program in 1999 for more stringent controls on pollutants like NOx and SO2. Additionally, the Act addresses hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as mercury through a two-phase federal regulatory program, with the first phase focusing on Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources of pollutants. The Clean Air Act includes requirements for controlling pollutants that impair visibility in national parks and wilderness areas, including installing Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources built between 1962 and 1977. The Act also addresses hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like mercury through a two-phase federal regulatory program, with the first phase focusing on Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources of pollutants. Electric utilities were given special treatment under Section 112, with regulations requiring an affirmative finding that regulation under Section 112 is \"appropriate and necessary\" before proceeding to issue MACT standards. EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 as its preferred approach for electric generating units emissions of HAPs. Under current law, states can implement more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal ones. Clear Skies would make changes to current regulations, including establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and modifying existing authorities related to mercury emissions from utilities. Additional changes include adding new programs and removing certain provisions for several years. The Clear Skies proposal includes new cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, as well as changes to existing authorities related to mercury emissions. It also adds new programs and removes certain provisions for several years. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury, along with various changes to existing regulations such as penalties reduction, preemption of state requirements, and elimination of certain environmental protection measures. The Clear Skies proposal includes a detailed cap-and-trade program for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. It aims to replace Title IV of the Clean Air Act with a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade system, setting caps on emissions in two phases and establishing trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 caps for EGUs include 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. Allowances would be allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs would be more stringent than current standards. The National Emission Standards for non-utility sources would allow units to opt into a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Units would receive allocations based on their emissions during optional base periods, with reductions in allowances over time. The cap-and-trade program for hazardous air pollutants would exempt units from compliance deadlines and regulations in exchange for opting in. Units would also be exempt from being considered major sources for 20 years. Clear Skies aims to reduce emissions by implementing equipment and combustion practices. It introduces a \"transitional area\" category to replace nonattainment designations, extending deadlines for reaching attainment and removing statutory requirements. Additionally, affected units are exempt from major source requirements for 20 years under the cap-and-trade program. Clear Skies exempts affected units from major emitting facility status under the Clean Air Act for 20 years. This includes exemptions from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements for PSD program. Units near Class I areas remain subject to PSD requirements. In nonattainment areas, affected units are exempt from NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting additional controls under State Implementation Plans. Clear Skies proposes exemptions for existing affected units and opt-in facilities from certain Clean Air Act regulations. It includes criteria for exemptions based on pollution control equipment and combustion practices. Changes to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Provisions would limit regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns and emission control requirements. The Clear Skies proposal includes exemptions for existing affected units and opt-in facilities from certain Clean Air Act regulations. It also introduces changes to Section 126 petitions, establishing a moratorium on the use of petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units and setting stricter requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium. The Administrator may grant findings on upwind sources emitting air pollutants contributing to nonattainment, requiring shutdown or mandated controls within three years. SIP submissions subject to Section 126 requirements must have an effective date after December 31, 2014. Factors considered include emissions reductions for relevant nonattainment areas and cost-effectiveness compared to other sources. The goal is to improve air quality in the petitioner's area. Clear Skies aims to reduce emissions from upwind sources and improve air quality in nonattainment areas cost-effectively. It also reduces penalties for noncompliance with sulfur dioxide regulations and does not preempt states from enforcing stricter limits. Clear Skies does not preempt states from enforcing stricter limits, but prohibits interference with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances under cap-and-trade programs. This could result in increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. The bill also exempts EGUs from New Source Review for 20 years, with new emission standards applying to reconstructed units. The bill establishes National Emission Standards for new EGUs, applying to reconstructed units with a cost threshold of 50% for component replacement. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications under current law. The bill eliminates Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for major sources operating between 1962 and 1977. Under Section 169A of the Clean Air Act, major sources operating between 1962 and 1977 are subject to BART to protect visibility in national parks. Clear Skies would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART for 20 years. The bill also addresses PSD requirements for affected units near Class I areas and exempts Class II areas from certain emissions regulations. Clear Skies would exempt affected units in Class II areas from offsetting emissions to maintain air quality within set limits. It also extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 standards, creating a transitional classification for areas showing they will meet standards by 2015. Failure to meet standards after 2015 would result in nonattainment designation and the need for additional controls. After 2015, areas failing to achieve the ozone standard would be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and required to implement controls to reach attainment by 2022. Transitional areas would be exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. EPA proposed to maintain specific requirements for nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for emissions non-compliance. Transitional areas under Clear Skies may qualify for exemptions from these requirements. Under Clear Skies, areas failing to meet the ozone standard may qualify as \"transitional\" and be exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. Proposed legislation would eliminate conformity requirements for most nonattainment areas until 2018, making changes to Title I for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Under Clear Skies, Title I would undergo significant changes for electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting in. The legislation eliminates location as a variable for controlling EGUs, regardless of their proximity to PSD Class I areas. Emission limitations and the allowance system would not be based on attainment or nonattainment areas. This would also remove states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas. Additionally, restrictions on trading by EGUs within nonattainment areas would be prohibited, limiting state and local governments' influence. Under Clear Skies, Title I would see significant changes for electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting in. The legislation eliminates location as a variable for controlling EGUs, regardless of their proximity to PSD Class I areas. Emission limitations and the allowance system would not be based on attainment or nonattainment areas, removing states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas. Restrictions on trading by EGUs within nonattainment areas would be prohibited, limiting state and local governments' influence. Additionally, the state's enforcement mechanism, NSR, is eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. If states set stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act equivalent statute, those standards would not be completely controlling. Preventing states from restricting allowance trading would create additional allowances that could be sold to upwind utilities not covered by the state's legislation. The state could neither prevent the sale nor obtain relief under a Section 126 petition forcing neighboring utilities to reduce emissions. Clear Skies aims to eliminate the need for stronger state and local standards for 8-hour ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS by establishing a new \"transitional\" designation for areas that do not currently meet ambient standards. Under Clear Skies, there is a need for stronger state and local standards to meet ambient air quality standards. A new \"transitional\" designation would be established for areas that do not currently meet the standards, with the goal of achieving attainment by December 2015. This designation would not require additional controls and would protect Class I areas within 50 km of facilities. However, there are debates on whether these measures are sufficient, and states are limited in imposing additional controls on EGUs and opt-ins. The controversy over EGU age remains a significant issue. Clear Skies aims to reduce the disparity between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves. Existing units would still have an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Under Clear Skies, regulations for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from Electric Generating Units (EGUs) would change. Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards and residual risk standards would no longer apply to new or existing EGUs, or to other industrial sources opting into the cap-and-trade program. This could make it harder to address areas with high concentrations of mercury. States setting stricter standards would not have full control, as allowance trading could still occur. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under certain conditions. Under Clear Skies, regulations for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from Electric Generating Units (EGUs) would change. The Administrator would retain authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under stringent conditions, including a requirement for a peer-reviewed study of public health concerns on an individual unit basis with notice and opportunity to comment. Any standards could not be implemented before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act: Are the targets stringent enough to permit the relaxing or removal of some provisions of the Clean Air Act designed to achieve the same thing with respect to electric utilities? Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would effectively remove additional electric utility control from the suite of options available to states. EPA's analysis indicates that some nonattainment areas will need additional controls and time to reach attainment. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would limit states' options for achieving NAAQS attainment and maintaining PSD increments by removing additional electric utility controls. The proposal's modest mercury controls may not adequately address widespread contamination issues, as many states have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury. The ability for industrial sources to opt into Clear Skies would further restrict state control over mercury emissions. The Clear Skies program limits states' options for reducing mercury emissions, arguing for quicker and cheaper reductions compared to the Clean Air Act. However, compliance deadlines under Clear Skies are extended, and early reductions may lead to increased emissions later. This flexibility complicates compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
