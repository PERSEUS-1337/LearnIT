    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Congress finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that high-quality prekindergarten programs lead to academic success and reduced social issues. Public spending on prekindergarten programs yields a $7 return and reduces the need for other services. Despite the benefits, around 40% of school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. Texas missed out on up to $118.48 million in Federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs due to education funding cuts in 2011. Certain local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs in response to the state's cuts, highlighting the need for direct application prekindergarten Federal program funding for localities. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications must be submitted by Governors or local government entities. States must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education in developing their applications. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State or local government entity must contribute non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount. These funds can come from State funding, local funding, philanthropy, or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may waive or reduce the matching funds requirement in cases of financial hardship. The Secretary may waive or reduce matching funds for a grant application if extreme financial hardship is demonstrated. Grant recipients can award subgrants to local entities for grant activities. The Secretary cannot award a subgrant to a local entity for a program if double-dipping prevention measures are violated. Authorization of Appropriations: $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2017 through 2025 are authorized for programs funded by local educational agencies or government entities. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an \"eligible local entity\" includes local educational agencies, early childhood education programs, and consortia of these entities. \"Full-day\" refers to a day equivalent to a full school day in the state and not less than 5 hours. A \"high-quality prekindergarten program\" is supported by an eligible local entity. A quality prekindergarten program supported by an eligible local entity serves children aged 3 or 4, requires high staff qualifications, and teachers must have a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a related field. The teacher in a quality prekindergarten program must have a bachelor's degree in any field, demonstrate knowledge of early childhood education, engage in ongoing professional development for at least 2 years, and be enrolled in a State-approved educator preparation program. The prekindergarten program must be completed in 3 years or less, maintain a class size of 20 children, have a child to staff ratio of 10 to 1, offer a full-day program, provide appropriate learning environments and curricula aligned with state standards, pay staff salaries comparable to K-12 teachers, conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and offer comprehensive services for children. The prekindergarten program must offer comprehensive services for children, including screenings for vision, dental, health, and development, family engagement opportunities, nutrition services, and assistance obtaining services when needed. The prekindergarten program provides nutritious meals and snacks aligned with Child and Adult Care Food Program guidelines, nutrition education for children and families, coordination with local educational agencies, physical activity programs based on evidence-based guidelines. The prekindergarten program must meet education performance standards, provide professional development for staff, maintain health and safety standards, and offer additional support services as needed. The prekindergarten program must adhere to evidence-based health and safety standards as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
