    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Employment and Education Enhancement Act of 2001\". The authorizations for Federal aid programs in elementary and secondary education, educational research, and statistics expired during the 106th Congress. Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is expected in the 107th Congress. These programs constitute the majority of Federal grants for education. The business community, including small businesses, is involved. The Education Statistics Act of 1994 plays a significant role in Federal grants for elementary and secondary education. The business community, especially small businesses, is concerned about the lack of basic skills in graduating students, impacting their success in the workplace. Studies show high deficiency rates in reading, writing, and mathematics among employees, with small businesses experiencing even higher rates. Small businesses face high deficiency rates in skilled manpower, with 60% of American Management Association member companies reporting scarcity. A 1999 report by the National Federation of Independent Business found that 18% of members struggle to find qualified labor. Additionally, a poll by the United States Chambers of Commerce revealed that 83% of members are concerned about the ability to get qualified workers, with education being a pressing public policy issue. The growth of high-skilled jobs is surpassing other fields, highlighting the importance of small businesses as the driving force of the nation's economy. Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of locally-driven education initiatives, considering small business views, promoting small business expansion for job creation, facilitating idea sharing between businesses and schools, and expediting Department of Education program approvals. The Secretary of Education will disseminate information to help small businesses collaborate with schools to improve education through various means. A centralized database will be established to share successful initiatives involving small businesses in education. An Office of Small Business Education will also be created. The Department of Education will establish an Office of Small Business Education to address the needs of small businesses in education, promote partnerships between schools and small businesses, and propose solutions to education-related issues facing small businesses. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Director of the Office of Small Business Education will provide technical assistance to small businesses, organizations, school systems, and communities to improve education outcomes. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2001 and the following 4 years. SEC. 8. TAX CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY EXPENSES. A new section is added to the Internal Revenue Code for a Small Business Education Opportunity Credit. The Small Business Education Opportunity Credit allows small businesses to claim a tax credit of 15% of qualified education expenses for work study programs approved by the State educational agency. The Small Business Education Opportunity Credit allows partnerships with secondary schools to offer work study and internship opportunities for eligible individuals, defined as full-time students or teachers in secondary schools. Exceptions include expenses covered by other federal or state credits, or for professional conferences and orientation programs. Definitions and special rules apply, following guidelines from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Small Business Education Opportunity Credit allows partnerships with secondary schools to offer work study and internship opportunities for eligible individuals. Special rules apply, including aggregation rules for certain employers. No double benefit deduction or credit is allowed under this chapter for amounts used in determining the credit. Carryback of the credit is limited before the effective date of the section. The Small Business Education Opportunity Credit, determined under section 45E, can be carried to a taxable year before the enactment of section 45E. Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include this credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study and submit a report to Congress on the challenges small businesses face in hiring skilled workers. The report will include information on worker shortages, their impact on small businesses, associated costs, and recommendations to address these challenges. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000."
