    "content": "Diversity of viewpoint in U.S. communications policy is supported by Congress and the FCC through programs promoting ownership diversity, especially among minorities and females. The courts have emphasized the importance of minority ownership in media rules. The FCC is mandated to consider how its ownership rules impact minority ownership. In 2009, the FCC sought comments on improving data on minority and female ownership. Legislation was introduced in Congress to revive tax incentives for businesses acquiring broadcast properties. Two bills in the 110th Congress aimed to revive a tax incentive for businesses acquiring telecommunications properties. The proposals defining minorities based on race may face strict court review, requiring narrow program structuring to survive legal challenges. From 1978 to 1995, the FCC operated a tax certificate program to assist minority-owned businesses in acquiring broadcast properties. The program allowed deferral of taxes on capital gains from sales, but faced scrutiny in 1995 when Viacom structured a deal. In 1995, Congress questioned the FCC's tax certificate program after Viacom structured a deal to defer $440-640 million in taxes on a broadcast property sale to a minority-owned business. Concerns were raised about abuse, lack of ownership continuity, and short holding periods. Congress repealed IRC \u00a71071 due to these issues. The FCC has a \"distress sale\" policy for broadcasters facing license revocation, allowing them to sell to minority-owned buyers. However, minority ownership programs have declined since a Supreme Court ruling. In 2007, the FCC proposed amendments to its Broadcast Ownership Rules, including defining Socially Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs). New rules promoting diversification of broadcast ownership were adopted in 2007, defining eligible entities as small businesses according to SBA standards. The FCC proposed amendments to its Broadcast Ownership Rules in 2007, defining eligible entities as small businesses based on SBA standards. The agency seeks to improve data on minority and female ownership of broadcast properties and may develop programs to encourage ownership by minorities and women. In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a that all race-based classifications by the federal government must pass strict scrutiny. This means any government action based on race must serve a compelling interest and be narrowly tailored. The Court emphasized that individuals, not groups, are protected from discrimination based on race. Law or regulation defining SDBs based on race would face close judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a in 1995 established that any government action based on race must serve a compelling interest and be narrowly tailored. Legislation or regulation defining SDBs based on the race or ethnicity of business owners would face strict scrutiny, with the government interest being to promote broadcast viewpoint diversity for the marketplace of ideas. The compelling nature of this interest in encouraging diversity over broadcast airwaves remains a topic of debate. The Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a in 1995 established that government action based on race must serve a compelling interest and be narrowly tailored. Prior to Adarand, the Supreme Court upheld the FCC's minority broadcast ownership policies in Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, stating that enhancing broadcast diversity is an important government interest due to the scarcity of electromagnetic spectrum. The government's duty to distribute spectrum to encourage a wide array of information sources and viewpoints was also emphasized. The Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a in 1995 established that government action based on race must serve a compelling interest and be narrowly tailored. In Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, the Court upheld minority broadcast ownership policies, emphasizing the importance of enhancing broadcast diversity for the public welfare. The Court highlighted the right of the public to receive diverse viewpoints over broadcast airwaves and the duty of Congress and the FCC to safeguard this right. The diversity of viewpoints on the airwaves serves important First Amendment principles, supporting the minority ownership policies. However, deeper analysis is needed to determine if broadcast viewpoint diversity is a compelling government interest that can withstand strict scrutiny. The Court clarified in Adarand that strict scrutiny is not necessarily fatal. Justice O'Connor acknowledged the persistence of racial discrimination's effects but did not limit racial classifications solely to remedying past discrimination. The dissent in Metro Broadcasting argued for applying strict scrutiny to ownership rules, questioning the compelling interest in broadcast diversity. However, recent decisions suggest that diversity of broadcast viewpoint could be considered a compelling interest, as seen in Grutter v. Bollinger. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Court held that diversity within a student body is a compelling interest that can withstand strict scrutiny. This decision was influenced by Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, which emphasized the importance of diverse viewpoints in enhancing the learning experience. The Court justified its determination by deferring to the University administration in selecting a diverse student body. The Court in Grutter v. Bollinger held that diversity in a student body is a compelling interest, justifying deference to the University administration in student selection. The educational benefits of diversity were supported by evidence, leading to a presumption of good faith. The interest in creating a diverse student body was equated to creating diversity in broadcast programming, both rooted in First Amendment principles promoting the exchange of ideas and serving public education and freedom of speech. The government must prove that broadcast diversity is a compelling interest, necessary, and narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The Supreme Court has not set clear parameters for a narrowly tailored program in this context, but examples from other contexts and the Court's analysis in Metro Broadcasting may provide guidance. The government needs to demonstrate that diversity of broadcast ownership is necessary to increase diversity of broadcast viewpoints. The Metro Broadcasting majority considered minority-owned broadcast stations to produce qualitatively different programming that contributed to broadcast diversity. The Court found that increased diversity in broadcast ownership is related to increased diversity in programming, but not necessarily \"necessary.\" The dissenting Justices in Metro Broadcasting raised concerns about the lack of evidence linking diversity among owners to diversity of programming. The dissenting justices in Metro Broadcasting questioned the necessity of minority ownership in increasing diversity of viewpoint in broadcast programming. They argued that the assumption that minority-owned stations provide unique viewpoints, while non-minority owned stations do not, lacked strong evidence to support it. The dissenters suggested a closer examination of the factual basis supporting the minority ownership program. The dissenting opinion questions the need for minority ownership to increase diversity in broadcast programming, suggesting a closer examination of the factual basis. Future minority ownership policies using race as a factor may require evidence showing a stronger correlation between ownership diversity and viewpoint diversity. The government must consider race-neutral alternatives before implementing programs that consider race. The government must consider race-neutral options for fostering diversity before implementing programs that take race into account. If diversity of ownership is deemed necessary for diversity of viewpoint, the program must be narrowly tailored to achieve this goal. Quotas or set asides based on race are not permissible and fail to meet constitutional standards. In Grutter, the Supreme Court provided guidance on permissible school admissions policies using race as a factor. Admissions decisions can consider race along with other factors to enhance diversity, as long as no strict quota system is used. Individualized evaluations are key in determining how an applicant contributes to student body diversity. The Court's constitutional concerns were assuaged by the individualized nature of the determination in admissions programs, which considered contributions to diversity without placing an undue burden on non-minority applicants. When promoting diversity in broadcast ownership, a court may uphold a program that considers race as one of many factors for diversity. Designing a narrowly tailored program using race as a factor should include reasonable durational limits, such as sunset provisions or periodic reviews. To meet the durational requirement for narrow tailoring in minority ownership programs, sunset provisions or periodic reviews may be necessary. Similar controls could be mandated for new programs enacted by Congress or the FCC."
