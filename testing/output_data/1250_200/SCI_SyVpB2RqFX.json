    "content": "The Information Maximization Autoencoder (IMAE) is a novel approach to learning both continuous and discrete representations in an unsupervised manner. Unlike the Variational Autoencoder, IMAE uses a stochastic encoder to map input data to a hybrid representation, maximizing mutual information. A decoder approximates the posterior distribution of data based on these representations, achieving high fidelity by leveraging informative representations. The proposed objective provides a principled framework for understanding tradeoffs in representation factors, disentanglement, and decoding quality in generative latent variable models like the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The goal is to find compact yet informative representations of data by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood objective. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) aims to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood objective, but this penalizes the mutual information between data and their representations, making representation learning harder. Recent efforts have focused on revising ELBO to address this issue, with approaches targeting disentangled representations or controlling mutual information. Instead of a generative latent variable model, a stochastic encoder is used to maximize mutual information between data and representations. The proposed model aims to maximize mutual information between data and representations, improving decoding quality and balancing informativeness of latent factors. It also introduces a framework for learning both continuous and discrete representations for categorical data, capturing categorical information and continuous variation in a more natural way. The proposed model focuses on learning hybrid representations for categorical data, aiming to maintain disentanglement of continuous variations shared across categories. Compared to VAE approaches, the model offers a more effective way to learn these representations. Several methods have been proposed to address the limitations of existing approaches like \u03b2-VAE, which penalizes mutual information between data and latent representations. Several methods aim to improve upon the limitations of \u03b2-VAE by addressing the mutual information constraint differently. Some propose pushing the KL divergence term towards a higher target value, while others drop the mutual information term altogether. Another approach focuses on learning disentangled representations by encouraging statistical independence between latent factors. Our information maximization objective contains the total correlation term and aims to maximize the informativeness of each representation factor. We introduce a new perspective to VAE-based approaches for unsupervised representation learning by maximizing mutual information between data and representations. Additionally, we incorporate a discrete representation to model real-world data from different categories effectively. The proposed objective offers a theoretically elegant way to learn semantically meaningful representations. The proposed objective in BID15 BID2 aims to learn compact and semantically meaningful representations by maximizing mutual information between data and its representations. This is achieved through a hybrid continuous-discrete representation approach, ensuring low-dimensional yet informative representations. The mutual information quantifies the information one random variable has about another, leading to decreased uncertainty and effective representation learning. The proposed objective in BID15 BID2 aims to learn compact and semantically meaningful representations by maximizing mutual information between data and its representations. A probabilistic decoder is used to approximate the true posterior, with the dissimilarity between them optimized by minimizing the KL divergence. The balance between maximizing informativeness of latent representations and maintaining decoding quality is achieved by setting a parameter. The optimization involves two key terms that quantify the informativeness of each representation factor and the statistical dependence between them. The objective is to learn meaningful representations by maximizing mutual information between data and its representations. This involves quantifying informativeness of each factor and statistical dependence between them. Maximizing informativeness while promoting statistical independence is key. Various sampling strategies are used to optimize total correlation. Tractable approximations are constructed for mutual information between data and the factors. The text discusses constructing tractable approximations for mutual information between data and latent factors, focusing on maximizing informativeness while promoting statistical independence. It highlights the importance of reducing uncertainty in the latent space to make it more informative about the data. The text discusses maximizing mutual information between data and latent factors by reducing uncertainty in the latent space. It suggests using a Gaussian distribution to avoid degenerate solutions and achieve a reasonable trade-off. This involves minimizing the KL divergence between the model distribution and a scaled normal distribution. The text discusses maximizing mutual information between data and latent factors by minimizing the KL divergence between them. It approximates the mutual information between a discrete representation and data, enabling optimization in a theoretically justifiable way. Maximizing mutual information I \u03b8 (x; y) involves balancing category assignment and categorical identity for each sample x, achieved by making p \u03b8 (y|x) deterministic and p \u03b8 (y) uniform. The overall objective includes information maximization and better approximation of the posterior p \u03b8 (x|y, z), with a focus on optimizing the informativeness of each latent factor. The text discusses achieving a balance between category assignment and categorical identity by weighting them differently. It also focuses on optimizing the informativeness of each latent factor and promoting statistically independent latent continuous factors. The objective is to formalize trade-offs regarding representation interpretability and decoding quality. The proposed approach, IMAE, aims to learn a hybrid of continuous and discrete representations, outperforming VAE based models. The priors chosen are the isotropic Gaussian distribution for z and uniform distribution for y.

The priors chosen are the isotropic Gaussian distribution for z and uniform distribution for y. The work compares different approaches like \u03b2-VAE, InfoVAE, and JointVAE in modifying ELBO to control mutual information. It qualitatively demonstrates that informative representations lead to better interpretability. In the current section, the text discusses quantitative evaluations on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and dSprites BID17 datasets. It highlights that maximizing mutual information between representations and data leads to interpretable latent factors. The study compares IMAE with other methods, showing better interpretability vs. decoding quality trade-off. The assumption on discrete representations is described before presenting the main results. The assumption for learning discrete representations is that the conditional distribution should be locally smooth to ensure similar data samples are assigned to the same category. Virtual adversarial training (VAT) is used to regularize the prediction model for maintaining local smoothness. Using VAT is crucial for learning interpretable discrete representations in neural networks. Using VAT is crucial for learning interpretable discrete representations in neural networks. Evaluating different methods on MNIST and Fashion MNIST shows that InfoVAE performs better than \u03b2-VAE in achieving category separation. InfoVAE distributes data over categories with large \u03b2 values while maintaining local smoothness with VAT. However, it struggles with less distinctive data like Fashion-MNIST. Figure 4 displays the model's ability to learn digit types and uncover underlying factors using IMAE. IMAE outperforms JointVAE and \u03b2-VAE by encouraging confident category separation and maintaining local smoothness with VAT. JointVAE struggles with getting stuck at poor local optima. The use of large \u03b2 values in \u03b2-VAE sacrifices mutual information, leading to less informative representations and poor decoding quality. In contrast, IMAE is better at learning discrete presentations over a wide range of values, resulting in better decoding quality for each category compared to JointVAE and InfoVAE. InfoVAE and JointVAE can also learn good discrete representations but may result in poor decoding quality in certain regions. In contrast to \u03b2-VAE penalizing mutual information with large \u03b2 values, IMAE consistently performs well with different hyperparameters, especially in regions where decoding quality and latent representation informativeness are good. The disentanglement capability of IMAE on dSprites is quantitatively evaluated using a metric that measures the gap between the top two empirical mutual information of each latent representation factor and a ground truth factor. High disentanglement scores indicate more informative and disentangled representation factors. The disentanglement quality of different methods varies, with IMAE performing well in balancing disentanglement score and decoding quality. Larger \u03b2 values in \u03b2-VAE degrade representation usefulness, while JointVAE maintains more mutual information but lacks disentanglement quality in certain regions. IMAE achieves a better trade-off between disentanglement score and decoding quality compared to InfoVAE and \u03b2-VAE. It focuses on learning categorical information while uncovering shared latent features, leading to good decoding quality and informativeness. IMA achieves a better trade-off between disentanglement score and decoding quality compared to InfoVAE and \u03b2-VAE by targeting informative representations directly, inducing semantically meaningful representations, and maintaining good decoding quality. The model aims at unsupervised joint learning of disentangled continuous and discrete representations, addressing challenges such as lack of prior for semantic awareness. However, a limitation is that it assumes independent scalar latent factors for disentanglement, which may not always be sufficient for representing real data with category-specific variation or correlated latent factors. The text discusses the need for more structured disentangled representations in data, highlighting the importance of group independence. It also mentions the balance between posterior inference fidelity and information maximization, emphasizing the trade-off in latent representation informativeness and generation fidelity. The decomposition of mutual information between data and its representations is also explored. The text discusses the concentration results of entropy with respect to the empirical distribution, assuming marginally independent variables y and z. It applies Hoeffding's inequality for bounded random variables to establish concentration results. The assumption of bounded distributions is practical due to the approximate uniformity of true and predicted data distributions.

It applies Hoeffding's inequality for bounded random variables to establish concentration results. The assumption of bounded distributions is practical due to the approximate uniformity of true and predicted data distributions. The method proposes estimating based on minibatch data to scale up for large datasets. The text proposes estimating entropy based on minibatch data and approximating it using Monte Carlo sampling. It discusses the distribution of variances output by an encoder and the tightness of the bound in the objective function. The model assumes a generative model with a stochastic decoder and seeks an encoder as a variational approximation of the true posterior. The model is fitted by maximizing the evidence lower bound. The model aims to maximize the mutual information between data x and representations z by using a stochastic encoder p \u03b8 (z|x) from the start, in contrast to other approaches that either drop the mutual information term or increase penalties on total correlation. IMAE starts with a stochastic encoder to maximize mutual information between data x and representations z. It targets informative and statistically independent representations, with the decoder serving as a variational approximation. IMAE performs well in balancing disentanglement score and decoding quality, showing a negative correlation between total correlation and disentanglement score. Training procedure includes MNIST dataset. The training procedure involves using momentum for MNIST & Fashion MNIST models with an initial learning rate of 1e-3 and decaying it by 0.98 every epoch. For dSprites, Adam is used with a learning rate of 1e-3."
