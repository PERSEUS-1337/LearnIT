The \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" limits contributions and expenditures by labor organizations. Amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act include requirements for labor organizations to provide written notification to employees regarding political activities. The \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" prohibits employees from being required to pay for a labor organization's political activities. Employees cannot be forced to join a labor organization, but can choose to pay an agency fee instead. The agency fee is limited to the cost of exclusive representation services provided by the labor organization. The \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" ensures that employees in a collective bargaining unit have the right to choose whether to be full members of a labor organization and pay membership dues. If they choose to be full members, they are entitled to a reduction in dues equivalent to their share of the organization's political spending. The cost of exclusive representation services and political activities is based on the previous fiscal year's expenses. The Act also specifies the breakdown of membership dues, reduced dues, and agency fees for the current year. The \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" requires labor organizations to provide an annual examination of financial statements by an independent accountant to verify expenditures for political activities and agency fees. Additionally, the organization must have procedures in place to determine costs chargeable to agency fee payors and provide a neutral decision-maker for challenges to these costs. The \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" mandates labor organizations to have independent accountants verify political expenditure statements annually. It also requires procedures for determining costs chargeable to agency fee payors and provides a neutral decision-maker for challenges to these costs. The amendments made by section 2 of the \"Workers' Political Rights Act\" will apply to contributions and expenditures made after the enactment of the Act."
