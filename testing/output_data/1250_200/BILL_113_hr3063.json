    "content": "The \"Healthy Fisheries through Better Science Act\" defines stock assessment as evaluating the past, present, and future status of a fish stock, including life history characteristics and fishing. It also requires a stock assessment plan. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a Stock Assessment Plan, which requires the Secretary to develop and publish a schedule for updating stock assessments for all fish stocks under a fishery management plan. The Stock Assessment Plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act mandates regular updates of stock assessments for fish stocks, with specific timeframes for completion based on the availability of appropriations and the characteristics of the stock. The Stock Assessment Plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires regular stock assessments for fish stocks, with specified timeframes, data identification, and a waiver provision if deemed unnecessary by the Secretary. The first stock assessment plan must be issued by the Secretary of Commerce within a specified deadline. The Secretary of Commerce must issue the first stock assessment plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act within 1 year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. IMPROVING SCIENCE. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to incorporate information from various sources for effective fisheries management. It emphasizes the importance of using the best scientific information available for conservation measures. Additionally, there are provisions for improving data collection and analysis by the Secretary in consultation with the science and statistical committee of the Councils. The science and statistical committee of the Councils will develop guidelines to incorporate data from nongovernmental sources into fisheries management decisions. The guidelines will identify types of data and analysis for recreational fishing, provide guidance for data collection, and reduce uncertainty in stock assessments. The Secretary and Regional Fishery Management Councils will use data and analyses meeting guidelines for fisheries management decisions. They must explain in the Federal Register how the information was used, and if not used, provide notice. The Secretary of Commerce must develop guidelines for using data and analysis in fishery management decisions within one year of the Act's enactment. If data is not used, the science and statistical committee must provide an explanation in the Federal Register notice. Within 1 year of enactment, the Secretary of Commerce must submit a report to Congress on cost reduction in fisheries management plans. The report will identify goals, methods for monitoring and enforcement, certify cost-effective methods, and explain why they may not be required. SEC. 6. COST SHARING. Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require the Secretary to prepare an analysis of costs recovered by fees before collecting any fees. The analysis must be included in the fisheries management plan."
