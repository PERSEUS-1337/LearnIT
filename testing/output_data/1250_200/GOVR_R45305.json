U.S. farm policy is closely scrutinized for compliance with WTO rules and its impact on future multilateral negotiations. The farm bill, in place since the 1930s, locks in U.S. policy behavior for an extended period, affecting farm income and commodity support programs. The current omnibus farm bill is the Agricultural Act of 2014. The Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the 2014 farm bill, made significant changes to existing farm programs. These commodity programs are set to expire in 2018 and may be replaced, extended temporarily, or allowed to lapse. The WTO plays a role in shaping U.S. agricultural policy due to its trade agreements and dispute settlement mechanisms. The WTO plays a role in shaping U.S. agricultural policy by setting country-specific spending limits on market-distorting policies and providing a mechanism to settle trade disputes among members. Compliance with WTO rules may require changes to U.S. farm programs through new legislation. Farm programs complying with WTO rules can avoid trade disputes. This report gives an overview of relevant WTO commitments for U.S. farm policy. Policymakers consider how new proposals impact U.S. commitments under the WTO, depending on cost, design, and objectives. The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort markets. Amber box subsidies, with the highest potential to distort markets, are subject to restrictions. The AoA categorizes agricultural support programs based on market distortion potential. Amber box subsidies are subject to spending limits, while green box and blue box programs are exempt. The WTO uses a traffic light analogy to group programs based on their trade impact. Green box programs are non-trade distorting, blue box programs are production-limiting, and amber box programs are the most market-distorting. The United States has a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays subject to de minimis exemptions. De minimis exemptions are limited by 5% of the value of production. Prohibited programs include certain types of export and import subsidies and nontariff trade barriers. WTO member countries are expected to submit notification reports on their commitments for monitoring and compliance. The WTO requires member countries to submit notification reports on policy commitments for monitoring and compliance. The Committee on Agriculture reviews progress based on these notifications, which are also posted on the WTO website. The U.S. recently notified the WTO of domestic support outlays for the 2015 crop year. Domestic farm policies are subject to rules under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) to prevent market distortion. The SCM evaluates domestic support programs for market distortion based on criteria like subsidy share of farmer returns, importance in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse effects. It assesses market effects on international trade and market prices, looking at displacement of imports, exports, and price suppression. The WTO's Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) agreement evaluates whether subsidies lead to market distortion and international trade effects. If a challenged subsidy is found to be prohibited, it must be stopped immediately or countermeasures may be taken. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding provides a framework for resolving disputes between member nations. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) allows members to resolve disputes through consultations and panel examinations. The United States has been involved in 564 complaints under the DSU since 1995. The United States Trade Representative represents the country in WTO disputes, including those related to trade-distorting support under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). The AoA sets a limit of $19.1 billion per year for amber box support, with complex procedures for classification. The WTO's AoA procedures for classifying trade-distorting support are complex. Four questions determine if a farm measure will exceed the $19.1 billion annual AMS limit. The fifth question checks if AoA-compliant outlays are also SCM-compliant. Policies can be classified as \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or \"amber box.\" Support exceeding the de minimis exemption may be excluded from AMS calculation. The WTO's AoA procedures classify trade-distorting support into green box, blue box, or amber box categories. Green box spending is exempt from limits as it is considered minimally trade-distorting. To qualify for green box exemption, a program must meet specific criteria and not provide price support to producers. Green-box-qualifying programs must not involve transfers from consumers or provide price support to producers. They can benefit the agricultural or rural community through research, pest control, training, marketing services, and infrastructure development. Public acquisition for food security and transparent stockholding are also allowed. Government financial participation in income insurance or safety net programs should have clearly defined eligibility criteria and compensate for agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period. Payments should be based solely on income, not production, price, or inputs, and should not exceed 70% of the income loss in the year of eligibility. Total annual payments should be limited. The government's income insurance or safety net programs should compensate for income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period, with payments not exceeding 70% of the income loss in the year of eligibility. Total annual payments, including natural disaster relief, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Structural adjustment programs aim to facilitate producers' retirement from agricultural production or transition into nonagricultural activities. Structural adjustment programs aim to facilitate producers' retirement from agricultural production or transition into nonagricultural activities through clearly defined criteria and payments. Payments are not tied to production type/quantity or prices, and investment aids are provided for financial or physical restructuring based on objectively demonstrated structural disadvantages. Environmental and regional assistance program payments are limited to compensate for structural disadvantages and extra costs related to program compliance. Eligibility is determined by specific program conditions, and regional assistance is provided to producers in disadvantaged geographic regions based on defined criteria. Payments are not contingent on production of designated products and must be limited to the amount needed for investment realization. Payments for environmental and regional assistance programs are limited to compensate for structural disadvantages and extra costs. Eligibility is determined by specific program conditions, and regional assistance is provided to producers in disadvantaged regions. Payments are not tied to production levels and must be limited to necessary investment amounts. Measures meeting certain criteria can be placed in the green box, exempt from AMS, while those not meeting criteria may qualify for the blue box exemption. Blue box programs must be direct payments under production-limiting programs. The blue box exemption criteria for program incentives include direct payments under production-limiting programs based on fixed areas, yields, or livestock head numbers. If conditions are met, the measure is exempt; otherwise, it is considered an amber box policy. Developed countries may exclude small-cost amber box programs from their total AMS calculation under de minimis exclusions. The de minimis exclusions for domestic support in agriculture include product-specific and non-product-specific support. Product-specific support must not exceed 5% of the total value of production of a basic agricultural product, while non-product-specific support must not exceed 5% of the member's total agricultural production value. The support provided through all measures specific to a product is tallied to determine if the 5% threshold is exceeded. For example, in 2015, U.S. corn crop support was below the 5% threshold, while sugar support exceeded it and was counted against the limit. The United States notified $8.2 billion for non-product-specific support in 2015, which was exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit. If total U.S. AMS does not exceed $19.1 billion, the WTO commitment is met. The U.S. has never exceeded its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit, with the closest approach in 1999 at $16.862 billion, thanks to de minimis exemptions. The United States has managed to avoid exceeding its amber box limit by utilizing de minimis exemptions in 1999, 2000, and 2001, despite total AMS outlays reaching $24.3 billion, $24.2 billion, and $21.5 billion respectively. The 2014 farm bill includes a safety trigger provision for USDA to adjust program outlays to prevent breaching the AMS limit. Additionally, compliance with WTO rules on adverse market effects from domestic farm support programs is crucial for the U.S. as a major player in agricultural markets. Negotiations for further reform in agricultural trade under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, began in 2001. Despite an impasse in 2009, talks resumed in 2011 with a focus on areas of progress. U.S. lawmakers are considering agriculture policy options while other countries assess compliance with WTO rules on farm support programs. The U.S. is aiming for substantial reductions in trade-distorting support and stronger rules in WTO negotiations. Congress may also seek domestic farm policies that comply with WTO agreements."
