    "content": "IMMUNITY FOR REPORTS OF SUSPECTED TERRORIST ACTIVITY OR SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE. Immunity is granted to individuals who report suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior in good faith and based on reasonable suspicion. They are protected from civil liability under any law for making such reports, unless the report is knowingly false or made recklessly. Authorized officials who respond to covered activity with reasonable and good faith actions also have qualified immunity from civil liability. Authorized officials who are not entitled to assert qualified immunity are immune from civil liability under Federal, State, and local law if they take reasonable action in good faith to respond to reported activity. Any person or authorized official found immune from civil liability is entitled to recover all reasonable costs and attorney fees from the plaintiff. In this section, \"authorized official\" is defined as individuals with security responsibilities for passenger transportation systems, including employees of relevant departments and law enforcement officers. The term \"covered activity\" refers to suspicious actions or threats against passenger transportation systems or passengers indicating potential law violations. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"passenger transportation\" in relation to potential violations of law, including threats to passenger safety and security or acts of terrorism. It includes various modes of transportation such as public transportation, over-the-road bus transportation, intercity passenger rail transportation, passenger vessel transportation, and regularly scheduled waterborne transportation services. The curr_chunk defines terms related to passenger transportation, including vehicles and passenger transportation systems. It specifies that the section will take effect immediately upon enactment and apply to all activities and claims occurring after that date."
