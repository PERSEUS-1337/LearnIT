    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The peg was adjusted based on market supply and demand, with the yuan's exchange rate becoming adjustable in 2005. Since July 21, 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate slowly through a \"managed float\" system, where market forces determine its movement but the government intervenes to control its rate of appreciation. The yuan's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, with a daily fluctuation limit against a currency basket. China maintains tight restrictions on capital transactions and continues to accumulate foreign reserves rapidly. Since 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate slowly through a \"managed float\" system. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar, leading to concerns about the U.S. economy. China's foreign reserves have grown rapidly, reaching $1.7 trillion by March 2008. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, worries persist in the United States. China's yuan has increased in value, but concerns in the United States persist. China is hesitant to make significant changes to its currency policy due to its own economic worries. This paper reviews economic issues related to China's currency policy, including concerns from the U.S., China's fixed exchange rate regime, U.S.-China trade imbalance, economic consequences for both countries, China's foreign exchange reserves, and policy options for the U.S. to encourage currency reform in China. Many in the U.S. believe that China's currency is undervalued compared to the dollar. Many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives argue that China's significantly undervalued currency has led to a trade deficit with the U.S., hurting American production and employment in various sectors. They urge the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. The Bush Administration has faced pressure to address China's currency policy, with calls for revaluation or allowing it to float freely in international markets. Initially, the Administration sought to encourage China to reform its financial system through cooperation programs, but later toughened its stance in 2005. This shift was driven by growing complaints from Members of Congress over China's currency policy. In response to pressure over China's currency policy, the Senate failed to reject an amendment imposing a tariff on Chinese goods. The Senate later negotiated an agreement to allow a vote on a similar bill. Numerous currency bills were introduced, with significant events occurring over the past year. On May 13, 2008, U.S. import prices from China increased by 4.1%, the largest 12-month rise since 2003. On May 8, 2008, the Bank of China reported an exchange rate of 7.00 yuan to the dollar, appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion in March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched on September 29, 2007, with $200 billion in capital. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was created with $200 billion to manage foreign exchange reserves. In 2007, CIC invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley. China clarified it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets in response to rumors. The IMF defined currency manipulation to discourage such practices. The IMF announced the need to deliver clear policy messages to discourage currency manipulation. In 2007, a petition was filed over China's currency practices, but the USTR declined it. The Treasury Department is required to report on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and determine if they manipulate their currencies. China has been cited for currency manipulation in Treasury reports. The Treasury Department issues reports on international economic and exchange rate policies, focusing on major U.S. trading partners. China was cited for currency manipulation five times from 1992 to 1994. Since 1994, no country has been designated as a currency manipulator. However, recent reports have increased criticism of China's currency policy and reforms, particularly since the currency reform in July 2005. The Treasury praised China's 2005 currency reforms but noted shortcomings in fully implementing a more flexible exchange rate mechanism. The Treasury Department did not cite China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, despite concerns about the yuan's value and China's managed float exchange rate regime. Chinese officials assured commitment to market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth. Treasury noted heavy intervention in currency markets and undervaluation of the yuan but stated that China did not meet technical requirements for currency manipulation under U.S. law. The Treasury Department did not label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. law, despite concerns about the yuan's value and China's exchange rate regime. The report emphasized the need for China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's effective exchange rate to minimize risks for the global economy. Many Members criticized Treasury's decision not to cite China as a currency manipulator, calling for legislative changes in how currency manipulation determinations are made. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not aimed at favoring exports or discouraging imports. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not meant to promote exports or discourage imports, but rather to foster economic stability and investor confidence. They express concern that abandoning the current currency policy could lead to an economic crisis and harm export industries during economic reforms. They also worry about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government corruption. Chinese officials believe that appreciating the currency could lower farmer incomes and create tensions. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy aims to maintain economic stability and investor confidence, not to boost exports or hinder imports. They fear that changing the policy could lead to economic crisis and harm export industries. Concerns also exist about rural unrest due to income disparities and corruption. Critics suggest that China's banking system is not equipped to handle speculative pressures that come with a fully convertible currency. The 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis highlighted the risks of a convertible currency and poorly regulated financial system. Despite considerations for currency reform before the crisis, officials now believe gradual reforms for a more flexible currency are key to stable economic growth. U.S. officials urge faster financial sector reforms and currency adjustments. U.S. officials are urging China to reform its financial sector and make its currency more flexible, including allowing faster appreciation of the yuan and decreasing intervention in currency markets. China previously operated under a fixed exchange rate system, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. The U.S. maintains a floating exchange rate system with economies like the Euro area, where supply and demand determine exchange rates. Under a floating exchange rate system, the relative demand for goods and assets determines the exchange rate. Changes in economic circumstances can affect the relative demand for a country's currency, requiring the central bank to adjust supply to maintain a peg. If China had a floating exchange rate, appreciation would likely have occurred due to productivity and quality improvements. The central bank in China maintains the exchange rate peg by adjusting currency supply to match market demand, which is reflected in the country's balance of payments. Excess demand for yuan led to an increase in foreign reserves to uphold the peg until 2005. Since 2005, China has maintained its exchange rate peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars from the public in exchange for yuan. The Chinese central bank holds U.S. financial securities, primarily U.S. Treasury securities. China has rapidly accumulated foreign reserves, becoming the world's largest holder by 2006. Foreign reserves grew significantly from 1995 to 2007. Despite efforts to prevent yuan appreciation, the currency has steadily appreciated against the dollar since 2005. Since the initial revaluation in July 2005, the yuan has appreciated steadily, reaching 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008. The current situation is a \"managed float\" where market forces influence the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation. China's rapid foreign reserves accumulation suggests that allowing the yuan to freely float would lead to faster appreciation. Foreign reserves are essential for financing international trade and defending against currency speculation as the economy grows. China's rapid accumulation of foreign reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth in recent years. The nature and composition of China's reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets, are not publicly disclosed. It is unclear how much of the increase in reserves is due to new accumulations, valuation changes, exchange rate effects, or reinvestment of earnings. The real exchange rate, not the nominal rate, determines economic activity, with inflation-adjusted rates playing a significant role. China's real exchange rate appreciated due to higher inflation from 1994 to 1997, making exports more expensive. By 2003, the yuan's value had risen, bringing it close to its 1998 level. In the long run, real exchange rates return to market value, whether fixed or floating. Appreciation in the nominal exchange rate would lead to a yuan appreciation if demand for Chinese goods increased. If the yuan were floating, it would appreciate with increased demand for Chinese goods. A fixed exchange rate leads to price adjustments over time. A fixed rate below market level results in a trade surplus with the US. Capital flows from China to the US through trade surplus and asset purchases. The Chinese central bank's accumulation of dollar reserves increases the supply of yuan, causing inflation in China. The Chinese central bank's accumulation of dollar reserves increases the supply of yuan, causing inflation in China. This leads to a rise in prices, affecting exports and imports. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a permanent competitive advantage. Floating exchange rates return to equilibrium value more quickly than fixed rates. Using monetary policy to influence currency value limits flexibility in countering economic downturns. China's fixed exchange rate with the United States limits its monetary autonomy, but it uses capital controls to mitigate the loss. The currency is convertible for trade transactions but not on a capital account. China uses capital controls to restrict access to foreign currency, with most Chinese enterprises required to exchange their foreign currency holdings for yuan. Purchases of foreign exchange are closely regulated, giving China flexibility over its monetary and fiscal policy despite the fixed exchange rate. The extent of the yuan's undervaluation has been a topic of discussion, with limited data available to estimate its potential appreciation. Estimates of yuan undervaluation in 2005 were based on the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate and purchasing power parity methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve a balanced current account. The exchange rate adjustment to achieve a balanced current account is a controversial method. Ernest Preeg estimated the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003 based on rule-of-thumb estimates. The U.S. trade deficit could be eliminated if the dollar declined by 40%, according to a rule-of-thumb estimate. The Institute for International Economics suggests that the yuan was undervalued by 15%-25% in 2003 and argues for a $50 billion reduction in China's surplus to achieve equilibrium. Goldman Sachs estimated that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a 9.5%-15% revaluation could bring China's current account to equilibrium. This revaluation is necessary due to the extensive use of imports in Chinese exports, with estimates showing exports would fall 0.2% and imports would rise 0.5% with the adjustment. Goldman Sachs estimated that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation could bring China's current account to equilibrium. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5% to 2.8% of GDP, estimating the yuan was 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar in 2003. These estimates are not based on econometrically estimated economic models but on simple assumptions. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are based on various assumptions, with contention over the definition of an \"equilibrium\" current account balance. Economists use personal opinions and arbitrary assumptions to determine equilibrium, leading to significant variations in estimated undervaluation. Changes in assumed equilibrium can greatly impact the estimated undervaluation. Some argue that the current account balance would be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks differences in saving and investment rates among countries. Countries with different saving and investment rates may lend to and borrow from each other for long periods of time. Studies suggest that China's current account position is actually a deficit, not in balance as traditionally assumed. This leads to an overestimation of the yuan's undervaluation. China's increasing foreign reserves are necessary to prevent its net foreign indebtedness from rising. China is lending to the rest of the world to prevent its net foreign indebtedness from increasing. Capital controls and net FDI inflows play a crucial role in this strategy. The equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging to determine due to capital controls. If these controls were eliminated, private Chinese citizens could potentially borrow from or lend to the rest of the world, leading to a persistent trade deficit or surplus. The Chinese central bank is currently lending, and U.S. lending to China remained unchanged. The equilibrium market exchange rate would be equal to the current fixed rate, and the trade deficit would remain unchanged. If private capital outflows exceeded the current increase in foreign reserves, the yuan would depreciate. China's high internal saving rate is more than sufficient to finance its investment, so it makes sense for China to offset FDI inflows with official outflows in the form of foreign reserve accumulation rather than run a current account deficit. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be considered proof of undervaluation. Wang argues that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than actual, suggesting the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach believes the U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and revaluing the yuan would reduce it. The Coudert and Couharde estimate the yuan is 54% undervalued, based on the belief that the dollar is incorrectly valued. If trade and financial markets are rational, the value of the dollar and trade deficit are sustainable. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is debated, with no clear theoretical approach to determine its sustainability. Evidence suggests it has lasted for years without hindering economic growth. Even if China reduced its bilateral trade deficit with the U.S., the overall deficit may not decrease significantly due to other countries still being able to lend to the U.S. It is uncertain if a \"fair share\" of deficit reduction can be attributed to China, and even if China's trade surplus was eliminated, it might still have a bilateral surplus with the U.S. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is debated, with no clear theoretical approach to determine its sustainability. Evidence suggests it has lasted for years without hindering economic growth. Even if China reduced its bilateral trade deficit with the U.S., the overall deficit may not decrease significantly due to other countries still being able to lend to the U.S. International experience suggests that even if China's overall trade surplus were eliminated, it might still run a bilateral trade surplus with the United States. The closest comparison is probably to other East Asian countries, which also grew rapidly and maintained high saving rates in recent decades. The experience of these countries is mixed, with some running current account deficits and others running surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, all of these countries have run large current account surpluses, indicating that the current economic environment may not be conducive to developing world borrowing. The current economic environment is not favorable for developing world borrowing. Several countries in the region have large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. China's current account balance is in line with its neighbors. Estimates show that China's currency is undervalued, with the Big Mac Index suggesting a 56% undervaluation in February 2007. However, relying too heavily on this index has drawbacks. The Big Mac Index is used as a light-hearted guide to exchange rates, comparing the price of a Big Mac in China and the United States. However, it has drawbacks as it only applies to tradeable goods, with most of the Big Mac's value coming from non-tradeable services. This makes the index unreliable in determining purchasing power parity, as local factors heavily influence prices. For example, a Big Mac in New York City is more expensive than in the U.S. rural south, leading to inaccuracies in currency valuation. The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory suggests that a dollar in the rural south is undervalued compared to a dollar in New York City. However, PPP has limitations as prices are consistently lower in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Economists have attempted to estimate currency values using PPP, but caution is advised as it may not accurately predict exchange rates in the short term. Jeffrey Frankel suggests regressing income levels on exchange rates to determine equilibrium rates based on PPP, estimating that China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000. Based on PPP, China's exchange rate was estimated to be undervalued by 36% in 2000, with speculation that the undervaluation has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde calculated the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Frankel notes limitations to this analysis, including the need for gradual exchange rate adjustments and the lack of immediate impact on the U.S. trade deficit or employment from an appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar. Theoretical rationale for linking income levels to exchange rate values includes the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect. Different proxies like the ratio of consumer price index to producer price index have been used to estimate undervaluation of the yuan in 2003. Results vary, with estimates ranging from 18% to 47% undervalued. Wang's regression suggests the yuan was only modestly undervalued in 2003. The authors caution that the price index proxy may be inaccurate for China due to non-market determined consumer prices. They also note that labor and capital mobility restrictions in China may interfere with the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Cheung et al. replicate others' results of yuan undervaluation but highlight that the estimates lack statistical significance. Adjusting for serial correlation reduces the estimated undervaluation. Dunaway et al. show that adding variables like openness to trade results in a smaller estimated undervaluation. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses the use of economic models to estimate currency misalignment. Different variables can greatly affect the estimated undervaluation, such as openness to trade. The report emphasizes the limitations of models in predicting exchange rate movements and suggests using multiple models to gain a better understanding. The Treasury Department's report discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment, focusing on protracted misalignments where currency adjustments are not occurring. Critics of China's currency peg point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of undervaluation, but bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes and exchange rate effects. Other factors, such as financial flows, should also be considered when analyzing trade deficits. China had a $256 billion merchandise trade surplus with the United States in 2007, but its overall trade surplus was $262 billion. Despite the undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar, China runs trade deficits with countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. U.S. exports to China have been increasing significantly, making China the third largest U.S. export market in 2007. In 2007, China surpassed Japan to become the third largest U.S. export market. The growing level of imports from China is largely driven by export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia, that have shifted production to China to benefit from low-cost labor. Data shows that a significant share of China's exports and imports are produced by foreign-invested enterprises, with FIEs accounting for 57.1% of exports and 58.5% of imports in 2007. China tends to have trade deficits with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with other nations. China has become a production platform for many foreign companies, leading to trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand nations like the United States. The rise of Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs) in China has significantly impacted the bilateral trade deficit with the US, driven by a surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) in export-oriented manufacturing. This trend started in the early 1990s and has continued to grow, with FIEs playing a crucial role in China's trade dynamics. Table 5 and Table 6 show the impact of Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs) on China's trade balance and production shift in the computer equipment industry. FIEs import 80% as much as they export, indicating little effect on China's overall trade balance. In 2000, Japan was the largest foreign supplier of U.S. computer equipment, but by 2007, China became the largest supplier with a 51.5% share of total U.S. imports. This shift led to a 436% increase in U.S. imports of computer equipment from China over seven years. The rise in U.S. imports of computer equipment from China by 436% over seven years has been fueled by foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervalued yuan benefits China's export industries by making exports cheaper, attracting foreign investment, and facilitating technology transfers. However, it also makes imports more expensive, impacting Chinese consumers and firms that rely on imported parts and materials. An undervalued currency in China benefits exporting firms but hurts consumers and non-exporting firms reliant on imports. Revaluing the yuan could impact aggregate spending, with differing views on its effects on the economy. Some argue it could prevent inflation and promote sustainability, while others believe it could disrupt the economy and absorb underemployed labor. China's currency policy limits the government's ability to use monetary policy for stability. China's currency policy in China is economically and socially disruptive. Economists argue that it hinders the government's ability to use monetary policy effectively, leading to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports for growth. This policy also increases the risk of non-performing loans in the banking system and attracts speculative investments, limiting the banks' ability to regulate investment decisions. China's accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves may facilitate a quicker move towards a fully convertible currency. However, it also comes with opportunity costs as the funds could be used for infrastructure, education, social safety nets, and bank recapitalization. This accumulation affects the yuan's value, impacting Chinese exports. The accumulation of foreign reserves in China affects the yuan's value, leading to exchange rate intervention. This causes Chinese exports to the United States to become cheaper, impacting U.S. exports and leading to a rise in the trade deficit. Many U.S. industries, particularly in manufacturing, are affected by this shift. Many U.S. industries, including small and medium-sized firms in machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die sectors, are concerned about China's competitive challenge. An undervalued Chinese currency affects the output of these industries. However, U.S. producers also import capital equipment and inputs from China, benefiting from lower prices due to an undervalued yuan. This exchange rate also impacts U.S. borrowers and the current account deficit with China. Capital flows from China to the United States through investments in U.S. assets, leading to increased capital investment and lower interest rates. This boosts aggregate spending in the short run and expands the economy in the long run. Chinese investments in U.S. Treasury securities also fund federal budget deficits. China holds $397 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, making it the second largest foreign holder after Japan. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan allows the U.S. to increase consumption of goods through improved terms-of-trade, boosting purchasing power. The undervalued yuan increases U.S. consumers' purchasing power. Import prices from China have risen, impacting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Critics argue that the low yuan value has harmed the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to job losses. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China. Manufacturing output has reached an all-time high, but employment has fallen due to productivity growth, not a decline in output. The trade deficit is not limited to China, and there is a long-term trend of moving U.S. employment away from manufacturing towards the service sector. This trend is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage, with the U.S. producing knowledge- and technology-intensive goods for trade with countries like China. Trade with countries like China leads to a shift in manufacturing abroad, reducing production in the United States. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that an undervalued yuan does not significantly impact U.S. manufacturing or jobs. Instead, it results in a shift towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates, with no medium- or long-run effect on overall U.S. aggregate demand. Lower interest rates benefit capital-intensive firms and producers of consumer durables. The trade deficit with China has not had a significant impact on overall U.S. employment. However, the effects of the deficit are not evenly distributed across regions and sectors. While the compositional shift in output does not harm aggregate U.S. output in the long run, there may be short-term consequences such as temporary declines in spending and employment. This could also lead to a decrease in the inflation rate, which may have varying effects depending on the economic conditions at the time. A fall in aggregate spending may be a concern if the economy is already sluggish. Government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can compensate for any decline in output in the trade sector. Shifting the composition of U.S. output to a higher capital base can result in a larger economy in the long run. U.S. citizens may not benefit from Chinese-owned capital in the U.S., but U.S. workers using that capital could see higher productivity and wages. China accounted for a significant portion of U.S. imports in 2007, but a country with a floating exchange rate can run an ongoing trade deficit due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment. The United States has been running an ongoing trade deficit due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment, with declining saving rates and a negative government saving rate. This leads to foreigners financing profitable investment opportunities in the U.S., resulting in a trade deficit. In contrast, China has a much higher gross national saving rate compared to the U.S. China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S., leading to a trade surplus for China and a trade deficit for the U.S. China's higher saving rate allows it to invest overseas, while the U.S. must borrow from abroad to fund its investment needs. Both countries would need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the trade deficit in the long run. Some analysts believe China is shifting towards boosting consumer spending, as indicated by high-level officials. The Treasury Department's report in November 2005 highlighted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth. However, it may take time for China to transition from exports to consumption for GDP growth. Economists are more concerned about the overall trade deficit rather than bilateral balances. Countries naturally have varying trade balances due to comparative advantage. The United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, despite both using the euro. The US relies heavily on foreign financing for investments, including from China. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could benefit US exports and reduce imports. However, there are concerns that a sudden drop in the dollar's value could disrupt the US economy. Some economists fear a sudden and severe drop in the dollar's value due to the large trade deficit, leading to potential dislocations in the U.S. economy. This scenario, though unlikely, could disrupt financial markets and hinder efficient intermediation. Despite its improbability, guarding against this risk may be necessary to prevent costly consequences. Central banks in China and other developing countries have helped prevent rapid depreciation of the dollar since 2002. The dollar has not depreciated rapidly since 2002 because central banks in China and other developing countries have accumulated foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. This support for the dollar has made private investors feel secure investing in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. If China and other countries were to stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could significantly decline, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States could pressure China to reform its exchange rate policy by making the yuan fully convertible or allowing it to appreciate. Options for currency reform in China include making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening the fluctuation band, and reforming the financial sector for greater flexibility. There is a policy debate on the best approach to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, with some Members of Congress frustrated over the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator. This designation could increase pressure on China to reform its currency, although negotiations are already ongoing. The Treasury Department is already negotiating with China to end currency manipulation practices. Proposed bills aim to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" and increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Despite this, the discretion to label the yuan as misaligned still rests with the Treasury. The U.S. government could persuade China to reform its exchange rate policy, as China's currency policy is seen as detrimental to its economy and global growth. Efforts have been made to assist China in financial sector reform and promote domestic consumption. China's attendance at G-7 finance meetings since 2004 has led to discussions on its currency policy, with the U.S. pressuring China to increase currency flexibility. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy, including by potentially linking China's future G-7 membership to such reforms or by involving China in talks with other East Asian economies on exchange rate policy. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy, potentially by involving China in talks with other East Asian economies on exchange rate policy. To convince China to liberalize its exchange rate system, the US could threaten unilateral trade sanctions or impose additional tariffs on imports from China unless it appreciates its currency to fair market levels. This approach aims to promote more balanced economic growth in China, emphasizing the importance of domestic consumption over over-reliance on exports and domestic investment. Some suggest using congressional threats to increase tariffs on Chinese goods to push for currency reform. Opponents argue that sanctions may violate WTO rules and backfire. Proposals like S. 1607 aim to impose sanctions on misaligned currency policies without violating WTO rules. Critics claim China's currency policy violates WTO rules, suggesting the US could file a case with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. The United States could file a case with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body against China's currency peg, potentially leading to trade sanctions if China does not comply. Using the WTO offers a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the United States. Alternatively, the US could consider initiating a Section 301 case under U.S. trade law to address foreign trade barriers. Failure to use WTO dispute resolution procedures could result in China filing a WTO case against the United States. The Bush Administration rejected Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy in 2004. In 2007, 42 House Members filed a Section 301 petition over China's currency practices, requesting a trade dispute case be brought to the WTO. The USTR declined the petition, expressing doubts about winning such a case in the WTO. Legislation like H.R. 321, H.R. 782, and S. 796 contain provisions to bring a case against China over its currency policy. H.R. 321, S. 796, and S. 1677 aim to address China's currency policy through U.S. officials and the WTO. The Commerce Department pursued countervailing duties against Chinese products in 2007, despite previous challenges in identifying subsidies in non-market economies like China. Commerce is pushing for countervailing duties against Chinese products due to identified government subsidies. Legislation like H.R. 782 and S. 796 would apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency manipulation as an export subsidy. Critics argue that determining China's currency subsidy level would be challenging and could lead to WTO challenges. Critics argue that challenging China's currency manipulation through antidumping laws may face WTO challenges. Legislation like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 propose factoring in currency impact on export prices for determining antidumping duties. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws related to China's WTO accession, such as safeguard provisions, could be an alternative approach. The United States can use safeguard provisions to impose restrictions on Chinese products causing market disruption to domestic producers. The Bush Administration invoked special safeguards on textile and apparel imports from China, leading to an agreement to limit exports. Legislation like H.R. 782 and S. 796 would consider exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. H.R. 782 and S. 796 would require considering China's exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. Policy analysts caution against pressuring China too hard on its currency policy, suggesting a more comprehensive approach to address trade issues. U.S. officials advocate for China to increase domestic consumption and adjust its currency policy for long-term global trade balance. Compliance with WTO commitments is a more immediate focus for U.S. trade policy regarding China. The focus of U.S. trade policy towards China is on pressing China to comply with its WTO commitments, including market access and protection of intellectual property rights. Supporters argue that pressuring China to adhere to international rules is more effective than direct pressure. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential use of it as a political tool. China could potentially use its large holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a political tool against the United States, threatening to make the dollar collapse if trade sanctions are imposed. This raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, prompting Senator Charles Grassley to seek clarification from the Chinese government. In response, the Chinese ambassador stated that China has no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves structure. According to an article in the Xinhua News Agency on August 13, a People's Bank of China official stated that dollar-denominated assets are important in China's foreign exchange reserves. China is seen as a responsible investor and unlikely to liquidate its dollar assets. Such a move could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan, capital loss for China, lower U.S. asset values, and increased export costs. It could also reduce U.S. economic growth and demand for imports from China. On September 29, 2007, China launched the China Investment Corporation to better manage its foreign reserves. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves. There are concerns about China diversifying away from dollar assets, potentially affecting U.S. interest rates. If the yuan appreciates, it could boost U.S. exports and reduce the trade deficit with China. This shift would require U.S. borrowers to find new lenders for financing. The Chinese central bank's decision to stop purchasing U.S. assets could lead to higher interest rates in the United States, reducing spending on interest-sensitive purchases like capital investment and housing. Analysts fear a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the U.S. economy. Inflation in the U.S. could rise if the yuan appreciates, leading to higher import prices and inflationary pressures. If the demand for Chinese goods and assets falls in the future, the floating exchange rate would depreciate, reversing the effects. If China were to move to a floating exchange rate, it would likely lead to the removal of capital controls, causing a potential outflow of private capital from China. This outflow could result in a depreciation of the floating exchange rate, reducing the output of U.S. exporters and expanding the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. China's decision to float its exchange rate could shift the burden of borrowing from China to private citizens buying U.S. assets. China could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls, shifting borrowing from China to private citizens buying U.S. assets. This could lead to a depreciation of the currency due to private capital outflow. Another option is to maintain the status quo, allowing the real exchange rate to adjust over time as inflation rates diverge. This adjustment would decrease the U.S. trade deficit and benefit U.S. exporters and import-competing firms. The real exchange rate adjustment could lead to a decline in the trade deficit and benefit U.S. exporters and import-competing firms over time. However, bilateral trade imbalances may persist due to China's high saving rate and the U.S.'s low saving rate. Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate, China's exports to the U.S. are likely to continue growing, as seen with the yuan's appreciation since 2005 not reducing the trade deficit. Policymakers are debating China's currency policy in response to concerns about the increasing U.S. trade deficit with China and the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. The debate among U.S. policymakers over China's currency policy is strongly linked to concerns about the growing U.S. trade deficit with China and the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. China's exchange rate has slowly appreciated since 2005, but the bilateral trade deficit has not fallen in response. There is considerable debate over the potential effects of a yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy, as it may benefit some sectors while harming others. The trade deficit with China has not hindered the U.S. from reaching full employment, and it is just one of many factors affecting manufacturing employment. The trade deficit with China has not prevented the United States from reaching full employment. U.S. trade with China is just one factor affecting manufacturing employment, along with productivity growth, shifts to the service sector, and the overall trade deficit. It is unclear if production has shifted to China from the U.S. or other low-wage countries. Foreign multilateral corporations' involvement in China's exports complicates who benefits from the trade. The effects of an appreciating yuan and the implications of a rising U.S. trade deficit with China are also considered. China's accumulation of U.S. assets slows the fall of the dollar, leading to debates on policy options to benefit the U.S. economy. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency. However, the current currency policy may hinder these efforts by increasing the money supply, potentially leading to more non-performing loans. Efforts to limit bank loans in booming sectors of the economy have mainly been the result of government directives rather than market forces, undermining the establishment of a market-based financial system. China's currency policy acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries while hindering others and preventing efficient resource distribution. U.S. officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, which they believe are impeding global trade balance adjustments and could harm world economic growth. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption and achieve more balanced growth. China officials aim to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education, but implementation may take years. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress on China's currency policy includes bills requiring the Treasury Department to determine if China manipulated its currency and imposing tariffs on Chinese products if manipulation is found. Additionally, there are calls for the U.S. to file a WTO case against China over its currency policy and to modify rules on currency manipulation. S. 796 (Bunning) and H.R. 1002 (Spratt) propose measures to address currency manipulation by China, including applying countervailing laws and imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods. H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) also aims to apply countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and consider undervalued currency as a factor in trade measures. H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) and other proposed bills aim to address currency manipulation by China by applying countervailing laws to nonmarket economies, considering undervalued currency in trade measures, and requiring Treasury to identify misaligned currencies for priority action. If consultations fail, the USTR would take action in the WTO. The proposed bills aim to address currency manipulation by China through various measures such as applying countervailing laws, considering undervalued currency in trade actions, and requiring Treasury to identify misaligned currencies for priority action. If consultations fail, the USTR would take action in the WTO. Additionally, the bills would impose restrictions on federal procurement, financing, and multilateral funding for designated countries engaging in currency manipulation. Several bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to address foreign exchange rate policies. S.Amdt. 309 (Schumer) to S. 600 proposed a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. The Senate failed to reject the amendment, leading to a vote on S. 295 with similar language. However, Senator Schumer agreed to delay consideration of the bill after being briefed on China's expected currency reforms. In response to China's currency reforms, Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 in the 109th Congress. Despite delays, there were ongoing discussions on applying U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China. The bill passed in 2005 would apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and require the Treasury Department to define currency manipulation. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate."
