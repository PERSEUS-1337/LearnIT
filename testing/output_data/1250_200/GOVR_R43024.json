    "content": "President Obama announced major developments in U.S.-Cuban relations on December 17, 2014. This included the release of Alan Gross and a U.S. intelligence asset by the Cuban government, leading to a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba. The new policy focused on engagement rather than sanctions, with steps such as reestablishing diplomatic relations, reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel and commerce with Cuba. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing funding for Cuba democracy projects and broadcasting. The law allocated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, with the possibility of transferring funds to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting to restore program reductions. Cuba released three political prisoners in December 2014, who were placed under house arrest while awaiting trial. Amnesty International expressed concerns about their fair trial. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights reported a significant increase in short-term detentions for political reasons in 2014, along with 102 political prisoners in the country. Since the end of the Cold War, Congress has been actively involved in shaping U.S. policy towards Cuba, with the enactment of various acts strengthening economic sanctions but also providing roadmaps for normalization of relations. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. a major source for Cuba's food imports. The Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-387, Title IX) allowed U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. a major source for Cuba's food imports. Congressional debates focused on U.S. sanctions, especially travel restrictions to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration initially eased family travel to Cuba in 2003 but tightened restrictions in 2004 due to Cuba's crackdown on dissidents. In 2009, Congress passed an appropriations measure (P.L. 111-8) to ease restrictions on family and agricultural exports travel. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, and migration talks in 2009. In January 2011, the Administration announced further easing of restrictions on educational and religious travel and non-family remittances to Cuba. In 2004, the U.S. eased restrictions on travel to Cuba. In January 2011, more restrictions were lifted on educational and religious travel, non-family remittances, and authorized charter flights. In December 2014, President Obama announced a shift towards engagement and normalization of relations with Cuba, focusing on increasing travel, commerce, and information flow. The report analyzes Cuba's political and economic situation, U.S. policy towards Cuba, and key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. Cuba's history as a Spanish colony until independence in 1902 is discussed, along with its role as a major sugar producer with African slaves. The report also covers U.S. policy towards Cuba, including changes under Ra\u00fal Castro and the Obama Administration, as well as key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. In 1898, Cuba was a Spanish colony and became a major sugar producer with African slaves. The United States intervened in the conflict leading to Cuba's independence in 1902. The Platt Amendment allowed US intervention until its repeal in 1934. Cuba's political system was dominated by authoritarian figures, including Gerardo Machado who was ousted by the military. From 1925 to 1933, Cuba saw political turmoil with a dictatorial President ousted by the military. Fulgencio Batista, a military leader, took control behind the scenes until he was elected President in 1940. After being voted out in 1944, a period of democratic rule followed, marked by corruption and violence. Batista seized power in 1952, leading to a brutal dictatorship and sparking popular unrest. Fidel Castro's failed attack on military barracks in 1953 led to his exile in Mexico, where he formed the 26th of July Movement. Returning to Cuba in 1956, Castro aimed to overthrow Batista, ultimately succeeding in 1959 after Batista fled the country. Castro then ruled for over 45 years before stepping down. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba for over 45 years after overthrowing Batista in 1959. He consolidated his rule, repressed dissent, and aligned with the Soviet Union while relations with the US deteriorated. Cuba became a close ally of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Castro declared the Cuban revolution socialist in 1961 and proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist. The Cuban Communist Party was established in 1976, and Castro ruled by decree until then. After ruling by decree from 1959 to 1976, Fidel Castro established the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in state and society. The Constitution outlined governmental structures with power centered in a Political Bureau. The National Assembly of People's Power holds legislative authority, with the president of the Council of State serving as head of state and government. Castro held this position until February 2008, despite temporarily stepping down in 2006 due to poor health. In 2008, Fidel Castro officially stepped down as president of the Council of State, confirming his departure as head of the Cuban government. This marked the transition of power to his brother Ra\u00fal Castro, ensuring stability in Cuba's political succession. After Fidel Castro stepped down, Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's President in February 2008. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura was selected as the first Vice President of the Council of State, a surprise choice. Machado, a hard-line communist party ideologue, was a close friend of Ra\u00fal. Ra\u00fal began implementing economic reforms in 2008, but there has been no change to his leadership. Under Ra\u00fal Castro's leadership, the Cuban Constitution designates the official successor to the president. Despite some economic reforms, the government maintains tight control over the political system, supported by a strong security apparatus. The Cuban military has gained influence in government, with key military officers serving as ministers. The Cuban Communist Party made changes during its sixth congress in 2011, with Ra\u00fal officially replacing Fidel as first secretary and political bureau and central committee restructuring. At the April 2011 party congress, Ra\u00fal Castro proposed term limits for top positions in the party and government, aiming for rejuvenation. The party's Central Committee was reduced from 125 to 115 members, with about 80 new members. Cuba's leadership has faced criticism for staying in power too long and not passing leadership to a younger generation. The January 2012 PCC conference did not bring expected changes but allowed for up to 20% replacement of Central Committee members. Cuba held elections in February 2013 for over 600 National Assembly members and 1,600 provincial representatives for five-year terms. At the February 2013 National Assembly meeting, Ra\u00fal Castro was selected for a second five-year term as president, with a two-term limit for top officials. First Vice President Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado was replaced by Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, signaling a move towards generational change in Cuba's political system. D\u00edaz-Canel, a member of the Politburo since 2003, became the official constitutional successor to President Castro. In 2013, D\u00edaz-Canel became a member of the Politburo and held top positions in the PCC. He served as education minister before becoming a vice president of the Council of State. Lazo Hern\u00e1ndez was appointed as the new president of Cuba's National Assembly, replacing Alarc\u00f3n. Generational change is underway in Cuba's political system, but President Castro emphasized that this does not signify an easing of the regime. President Castro acknowledged a generational transfer of power in Cuba during the 60th anniversary of the revolution in 2013. Observers predict a smooth leadership transition in 2018, but there may be increased factionalism without Castro. The Conference of Catholic Bishops called for political updates to allow diversity of thought and dialogue among social groups. The Cuban government has a poor human rights record, restricting freedoms of expression and association. The Cuban government has a poor record on human rights, restricting freedoms of expression and association. Members of the Ladies in White human rights group have been harassed, and political prisoners conducting hunger strikes have died in recent years. Amnesty International reports ongoing harassment and detentions of political opponents by the Cuban government. Amnesty International reports that the Cuban government continues to harass and detain political opponents to suppress demands for civil and political rights. Despite the release of political prisoners in 2011, AI states that there has been no change in human rights policy in Cuba. The government employs tactics such as intimidation, surveillance, and acts of repudiation to control dissidents and critics. Several prisoners of conscience, including Iv\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez Depestre and the Vargas Mart\u00edn brothers, remain detained for their peaceful protests and activism. The Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) members were detained in 2012 and convicted in 2014 for public disorder. Amnesty International (AI) believed their arrest was to intimidate government critics. AI also reported on other cases of arbitrary detention by the Cuban government, including the release of Sonia Garro Alfonso, Ram\u00f3n Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez, and Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez in 2014. AI expressed concern about fair trials for political prisoners in Cuba. The Cuban government has released numerous political prisoners in recent years, but the number of political prisoners has reportedly increased since 2012. In June 2014, the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation estimated that Cuba held at least 102 political prisoners, up from an estimated 50 in April 2012. Short-term detentions for political reasons have also increased significantly in recent years. The number of short-term detentions for political reasons in Cuba has significantly increased in recent years, with a spike in 2012 and 2013. The total number of detentions from 2010 to 2014 has risen, with a notable increase in 2014. Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1's death in 2012 drew international attention, as he was known for founding the Varela Project in 1996. In a crash involving Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, Jens Aron Modig and Angel Carromero Barrios were also present. Carromero was convicted of vehicular manslaughter but claimed the car was struck from behind and he was drugged. Pay\u00e1's daughter called for a UN investigation. Modig stated he was asleep during the accident. The US Senate and Department of State called for impartial investigations into the crash. The Department of State called for an independent international investigation into the deaths of Pay\u00e1 and Cepero. Independent Cuban blogs critical of the government have been countered by official government bloggers. Yoani S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her critical website Generaci\u00f3n Y. S\u00e1nchez launched an independent digital newspaper in Cuba in May 2014. H.Res. 121 in the 113th Congress would honor S\u00e1nchez for challenging repression by the Castro regime. In recent years, Cuba has seen some advances in limited economic reforms and openness to debate on economic issues. The Catholic Church has played a role in broadening the debate on social and economic issues through its publications. In 2014, the editors of Espacio Laical resigned due to pressure, but later announced the launch of a new online forum called Cuba Posible. Cuba also took the significant step of eliminating its long-standing restrictions in January 2013. In July 2014, Cuba announced the launch of a new online forum called Cuba Posible. The country eliminated its policy of requiring exit permits for travel in January 2013, allowing dissidents and activists to travel abroad. Prominent dissident economist Oscar Espinosa Chepe, who was imprisoned in 2003 and released on medical parole in 2004, passed away in Spain in 2013. He was known for advocating for economic policy and human rights in Cuba. Oscar Espinosa Chepe, a prominent dissident economist advocating for human rights in Cuba, passed away in Spain in 2013. Cuba remained on the Tier 3 list for combatting trafficking in persons, but showed progress in addressing sex trafficking. The Cuban government aims to amend its criminal code to comply with international standards. Cuba's economy is state-controlled, with key sectors including professional services export and tourism. Cuba's economy relies on various sources of foreign exchange, including professional services export, tourism, nickel mining, and a biotechnology sector. Remittances from abroad, particularly from the United States, also play a significant role. The sugar industry has declined, while Cuba is heavily dependent on Venezuela for its oil needs. Despite efforts to become a net oil exporter, setbacks have been encountered. Cuba's goal of becoming a net oil exporter was set back in 2012 due to unsuccessful exploratory oil drills. This, combined with political and economic difficulties in Venezuela, has raised concerns about the security of support from Venezuela. Cuba is now focusing on diversifying trading partners and seeking alternative energy suppliers. Cuba has achieved high levels of human development, with a ranking of 44 out of 187 countries worldwide. The World Bank estimates Cuba's per capita income was in the upper middle income range in 2012. Cuba's per capita income was estimated to be in the upper middle income range in 2012, showing significant economic growth despite challenges in the past. The economy experienced severe deterioration from 1989 to 1993 but improved with market-oriented reforms from 1994 to 2000. Strong growth was seen in the tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, supported by Venezuela and China. However, natural disasters and global financial crises in 2008 and 2009 led to austerity measures and slowed growth. Since 2010, Cuba's economy has shown modest improvement with growth rates of 2.4% in 2010, 2.8% in 2011, 3% in 2012, and 2.7% in 2013. However, forecasts for 2014 predict a lower growth rate of 1.2% due to challenges in transitioning to a decentralized economy. The government aims for 1.4% growth, but experts suggest a growth rate of 5% to 7% is needed for economic development. Ra\u00fal Castro's administration has made some economic policy changes, but more extensive reforms are desired. The government of Ra\u00fal Castro has implemented economic policy changes, allowing more private sector activities. Self-employment and small businesses have increased, with almost 200 categories of work allowed. Non-agricultural cooperatives have been established, and state-run restaurants are being converted to cooperatives. Analysts urge more support for the private sector, including expanding authorized activities and providing credit for small businesses. A challenge is the lack of money in circulation for most Cubans. The Cuban government has implemented economic policy changes to support the private sector, but there is a lack of money in circulation for most Cubans. Private sector activities catering to tourists and foreign diplomats have fared better than those serving the Cuban market. Questions have been raised about the government's commitment to the private sector due to crackdowns on certain economic activities. The Communist Party approved economic guidelines in 2011 that include potential reforms such as the liquidation of state enterprises with financial losses and the gradual elimination of the ration system. The Cuban government has implemented economic policy changes to support the private sector, including the creation of special development zones for foreign investment and the gradual elimination of the ration system. However, some analysts believe the changes are too limited to address Cuba's economic challenges, such as low wages and the dual-currency system. In 2013, the government announced plans to move towards ending the dual-currency system and monetary unification. In 2013, the Cuban government announced plans to end its dual-currency system and move towards monetary unification. In March 2014, instructions were provided for the removal of the CUC from circulation, known as \"day zero.\" Uncertainty surrounds the actual date and exchange rate system post-reform. The reform aims to boost productivity and improve the business climate, with a focus on the agricultural sector to increase food production. Despite efforts, overall food production has fallen below targets, exacerbated by natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2012, Cuba's coffee sector was affected by Hurricane Sandy, leading to underperformance in agricultural production. In 2013, a pilot program was introduced to end the government's food distribution monopoly in select provinces. In 2014, a new foreign investment law was approved to attract capital, offering tax cuts and exemptions for companies. The law aims to streamline approval processes and improve transparency, but its effectiveness in attracting investments remains uncertain. Cuba has closed joint ventures with foreign companies and taken action against corrupt executives in recent years. In recent years, Cuba has closed joint ventures with foreign companies and arrested executives for corrupt practices. The government issued a list of projects seeking investment in energy, tourism, agriculture, and industry. State-run companies can now keep 50% of profits, set wages, and have more flexibility in production and marketing decisions. Economists urge more reforms to embrace competition and criticize the reliance on central planning and foreign trade monopoly. During the Cold War, Cuba received substantial support from the Soviet Union, but after the Soviet Union's dissolution, Cuba had to open up its economy and establish trade relations with various countries. Venezuela, under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, became a key supporter by providing subsidized oil and investments, while Cuba sent medical personnel in return. Cuba's concerns about future Venezuelan support arose after Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013 and Maduro's election. Cuba's top trading partners included Venezuela, the Netherlands, Canada, and China for exports, and Venezuela, China, Spain, Brazil, and the United States for imports. Relations with Russia have strengthened in recent years, with high-level visits and debt forgiveness agreements. During his visit to Cuba in July 2014, Putin signed a debt forgiveness agreement, with Cuba repaying $3.5 billion over 10 years for Russian investment projects. Despite reports of reopening a signals intelligence facility, Putin denied the claims. Russian energy companies have been involved in oil exploration in Cuba, with mixed results. Gazprom and Zarubezhneft were among the companies active in this sector. Relations between Cuba and Russia have strengthened in recent years, with agreements signed for offshore oil exploration and cooperation in optimizing oil production. Despite skepticism from energy analysts due to past unsuccessful attempts, Russian energy companies are actively involved. Additionally, relations with China have improved, with increased trade and investment. High-level visits between the two countries have occurred, indicating a growing partnership. In June 2011 and July 2014, President visited Cuba and President Ra\u00fal Castro visited China in 2012, signing cooperation agreements. During Xi Jinping's 2014 visit to Cuba, 29 trade and other agreements were signed. The European Union and Cuba made progress in talks for cooperation in 2014. EU's position on Cuba includes encouraging democracy and human rights. El Salvador restored relations with Cuba in June 2009. Cuba has strengthened its relations with Latin American nations, including El Salvador, Venezuela, and Brazil. It is a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas and has been involved in various cooperation programs. Cuba became a full member of the Rio Group and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Ra\u00fal Castro assumed the presidency of CELAC in January 2013. In 2011, CELAC was established to boost regional cooperation, excluding the United States and Canada. Ra\u00fal Castro led the organization in 2013, hosting a summit in Chile. Cuba hosted the second summit in 2014, where human rights issues were raised by the U.N. Secretary General. The summit emphasized nonintervention and the right of states to choose their systems. Cuba's interest in attending the Summit of the Americas in 2012 was opposed by the U.S. and Canada. In 2011, CELAC was established to boost regional cooperation, excluding the United States and Canada. Ra\u00fal Castro led the organization in 2013, hosting a summit in Chile. Cuba hosted the second summit in 2014, where human rights issues were raised by the U.N. Secretary General. The summit emphasized nonintervention and the right of states to choose their systems. Cuba's interest in attending the Summit of the Americas in 2012 was opposed by the U.S. and Canada. In Cartagena, Colombia, Cuba was not invited to attend the Summit of the Americas due to opposition from the United States and Canada. Several Latin American nations vowed not to attend the next Summit of the Americas in Panama in April 2015 unless Cuba was allowed to participate. Panama eventually announced in August 2014 that Cuba would be invited to attend. President Obama announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in December 2014, stating that the United States was prepared to have Cuba join the next summit with a focus on human rights and democracy. Cuba was excluded from the OAS in 1962 due to its identification with Marxism-Leninism, but in June 2009, the OAS overturned the resolution, potentially allowing Cuba to reenter the organization. In 2009, the OAS overturned the 1962 resolution, potentially allowing Cuba to reenter the organization. Despite welcoming the decision, Cuba stated it would not return to the OAS. Cuba is active in international forums like the UN and the UN Human Rights Council. The UN has supported Cuba with relief efforts, including a $30.6 million Plan of Action after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Cuba, a founding member of the World Trade Organization, hosted the 14th summit of the Non-aligned Movement in 2006. In 2013, a North Korean freighter with stops in Cuba was detained in Panama due to suspicion of carrying illicit narcotics. Weapons were found hidden aboard the ship. The North Korean crew tried to prevent Panama from searching the ship, with the captain attempting suicide. Weapons were found hidden aboard along with sugar. Cuba acknowledged the ship was carrying 10,000 tons of sugar and \"obsolete defensive weapons\" to be repaired and returned. Questions arose about Cuba's efforts to repair the outdated weapons, with speculation that they were seeking upgrades from North Korea. Some reports suggested Cuba was upgrading its missile systems with help from North Korea, possibly in exchange for sugar. Analysts questioned if MiGs included in the shipment would be returned to Cuba. Reports indicated North Korea may use the military equipment for its own defenses rather than repairing it for Cuba. The Chong Chon Gang shipment from North Korea to Cuba included a variety of weapons and military equipment intended for Pyongyang's own use in conventional military defenses. The discovery raises questions about previous weapon shipments between the two countries and the nature of their relations. North Korean ships have made multiple trips to Cuba since 2009, with reports of visits by the O Un Chong Nyon Ho and the Mu Du Bong vessels. The O Un Chong Nyon Ho and Po Thong Gang, North Korean ships, visited Cuban ports in 2012 and 2011. Despite historical ties during the Cold War, recent military delegations suggest a growing military relationship between Cuba and North Korea. Former President Fidel Castro acknowledged arms support from North Korea in the 1980s. The recent detention of the Chong Chon Gang raises questions about their weapon shipments and bilateral military ties. The military delegation to Cuba in early July 2013, led by General Kim Kyok Sik, Chief of the Korean People's Army General Staff, met with Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro to discuss bilateral military relations. Panama requested a U.N. Security Council investigation into the shipment on the Chong Chon Gang, which was found to have violated U.N. sanctions. The U.N. Panel of Experts confirmed that the weapons found on the ship were in violation of sanctions. The U.N. Panel of Experts confirmed that the hidden cargo on the Chong Chon Gang violated sanctions, including surface-to-air missile systems, MiG-21 aircraft, and ammunition. Sanctions were imposed on the operator, Ocean Maritime Management Company, Ltd, for their role in arranging the illegal shipment. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power condemned the incident as a deliberate attempt to circumvent resolutions. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations condemned the North Korean ship incident as an illegal attempt to circumvent sanctions. The history of tense U.S.-Cuban relations includes events like the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, and mass exoduses of Cubans to the U.S. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo. President Kennedy initiated the embargo in 1962 under the Foreign Assistance Act, later expanding it with the Trading with the Enemy Act. In 1963, the Cuban Import Regulations were replaced with the more comprehensive Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were established in July 1963 under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the Foreign Assistance Act. These regulations prohibit most financial and trade transactions with Cuba and are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The CACR also require all exports to Cuba to be licensed by the Department of Commerce. The sanctions were strengthened with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-114), also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade. This law codified the Cuban embargo, limiting the executive branch's ability to lift it without congressional approval. It includes measures to increase pressure on Cuba and provides for assistance during a transition to democracy. The Helms/Burton legislation of 1996, also known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, imposes sanctions on Cuba and restricts trade with U.S. subsidiaries. It includes provisions for increasing pressure on Cuba and providing assistance during a transition to democracy. Additionally, the law allows for monetary damages in U.S. federal court for trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government, although Presidents have suspended its implementation. The U.S. also supports the Cuban people through humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and broadcasting. Agricultural exports to Cuba are allowed under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy towards Cuba after Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit, including resuming direct flights, cash remittances, and streamlining procedures for medical supplies. President Clinton announced additional measures in January 1999, broadening cash remittances and expanding direct passenger charter flights to Cuba from more U.S. cities. The George W. Bush Administration continued the two-track U.S. policy towards Cuba, maintaining economic sanctions while supporting the Cuban people through various measures. They tightened restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian aid to Cuba, and established a Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba to help bring about an end to the dictatorship. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba issued reports with recommendations to tighten restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian aid to Cuba. The Bush Administration increased funding for democracy and human rights efforts in Cuba, emphasizing a sanctions-based approach until political change occurs. Ra\u00fal Castro's rise to power in 2008 prompted calls for peaceful, democratic change in Cuba. The Bush Administration urged the Cuban government to release political prisoners, respect human rights, and pave the way for free and fair elections. The Obama Administration continued economic sanctions but also reached out to the Cuban people through easing travel restrictions and increasing support for democracy and human rights projects. The Obama Administration made efforts to engage Cuba and improve relations by easing travel restrictions and increasing support for democracy and human rights projects. In 2014, President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba, including the restoration of diplomatic relations and a new approach towards engagement. In April 2009, the Obama Administration lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, followed by further measures in January 2011 to ease travel restrictions and allow all Americans to send remittances. These actions aimed to increase purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities, empower Cubans to determine their own future, and build connections between the Cuban and American people. The Obama Administration initiated policies to engage with the Cuban government in 2009, aiming to improve relations and build connections between the Cuban and American people. President Obama announced a new beginning with Cuba at the 2009 Summit of the Americas, emphasizing the importance of overcoming mistrust and engaging on various issues such as drugs, migration, human rights, and democratic reform. In July 2009, Cuba and the United States restarted migration talks and discussed resuming direct mail service. However, relations soured in December 2009 when an American subcontractor, Alan Gross, was arrested in Havana for providing Internet equipment to Cuba's Jewish community. Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison, leading to tensions between the two countries. In March 2011, Alan Gross was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for providing Internet equipment to Cuba's Jewish community. Despite efforts by U.S. officials and Members of Congress to secure his release, relations between the United States and Cuba were strained. However, in mid-2013, there was renewed engagement with Cuba on various issues, including talks for direct mail service and a preliminary agreement on air and maritime search and rescue. Talks in 2009 had not led to a resumption of direct mail service, but the September 2013 talks were described as \"fruitful\" by the State Department. The United States and Cuba resumed migration talks in 2013 to establish a pilot program for direct mail transport between the two countries. Positive statements were issued after rounds of talks in 2013 and 2014, focusing on air and maritime search and rescue cooperation. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry also addressed U.S. policy towards Cuba in November 2013. In November 2013, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry discussed U.S. policy towards Cuba. They emphasized the need for creative and updated policies, acknowledging the changing times with technology and travel. Secretary Kerry noted some cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba on common interests, welcoming changes in Cuba allowing more freedom for its citizens. However, he also highlighted the authoritarian reality faced by ordinary Cubans. The Secretary of State highlighted the authoritarian reality faced by ordinary Cubans in Cuba, emphasizing the lack of freedom to criticize leaders without fear of arrest or violence. The handshake between President Obama and President Castro in 2013 sparked debate on thawing relations, with critics citing human rights violations as a concern under the Obama Administration. Human rights violations in Cuba under the Obama Administration remained a concern, with statements expressing worry about targeted repression against dissidents and the government's poor human rights record. U.S. officials praised the release of political prisoners but noted that it did not improve the situation as short-term detentions continued. Meetings with Cuban dissidents and expressions of concern about suppression of peaceful activities were held in 2013. President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry reiterated worries about human rights and freedom of expression in Cuba. In 2014, the State Department condemned Cuba's harsh tactics against civil society, including arbitrary detentions and physical violence. They expressed deep concern about human rights abuses and condemned the government's use of violence and arbitrary detention. The detention of members of the Ladies in White seeking to commemorate a tragic event was also condemned. The State Department condemned the detention of over 100 members of the Ladies in White commemorating the 20-year anniversary of the sinking of the \"13 de Marzo\" tugboat by the Cuban government. Securing the release of Alan Gross from prison in Cuba was a top U.S. priority, with efforts made through various channels including the Vatican. President Obama announced major developments in U.S.-Cuban relations in December 2014, including the release of Alan Gross and an important intelligence asset by the Cuban government. In December 2014, the Cuban government released an important U.S. intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents. This led to a major shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement instead of sanctions. President Obama announced the normalization of relations between the two countries, while still addressing human rights and democracy issues. The President announced steps towards normalization of relations with Cuba, including reestablishing diplomatic relations, reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel and commerce. Policy changes include expanding travel authorizations, increasing remittances, and allowing certain exports to empower Cuba's private sector. The policy changes announced by the President include authorizing sales/exports to Cuba of certain goods and services to empower Cuba's private sector, allowing licensed travelers to import goods worth $400 from Cuba, permitting U.S. financial institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions, revising the definition of \"cash in advance\" for authorized trade with Cuba, allowing the use of U.S. credit and debit cards by authorized travelers, and permitting the commercial sale of certain consumer communication devices and related services in Cuba. The new policy changes announced by the President focus on authorizing telecommunications providers to establish necessary mechanisms in Cuba for commercial services, allowing U.S.-owned entities in third countries to engage in transactions with Cuban individuals, and requiring changes to U.S. embargo regulations. These changes are expected to be issued within the next few weeks and build upon previous efforts to ease embargo restrictions. The President's new policy changes aim to ease embargo restrictions in Cuba, building upon previous efforts by President Obama. However, the President acknowledged that he cannot lift the embargo without Congress, as it is codified into legislation. The embargo is tied to conditions in Cuba, requiring amendments to multiple laws for its lifting. The President's new policy changes aim to ease embargo restrictions in Cuba, with provisions impeding economic relations being addressed. The Administration is prepared to have Cuba join the Summit of the Americas in April 2015, emphasizing human rights and democracy as key themes. Cuba's participation in the summit was a challenge, with Latin American nations vowing not to participate if Cuba was not invited. Various schools of thought exist on how to achieve the objectives of bringing democracy and respect for human rights to Cuba. Several schools of thought exist on how to achieve the objectives of bringing democracy and respect for human rights to Cuba. Efforts in Congress to ease U.S. sanctions have been ongoing, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others support lifting some sanctions and engaging in dialogue with Cuba. In March 2009, Congress took action to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba, marking the first time since 2000 that Congress has eased Cuba sanctions. In response to Fidel Castro's departure and economic changes under Ra\u00fal Castro, there are two main policy approaches towards Cuba: maintaining isolation while supporting the Cuban people, or increasing engagement to influence attitudes. Advocates for easing U.S. sanctions argue that it could lead to peaceful reform in Cuba and prevent violent upheaval or mass migration to the U.S. Advocates for changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue for a more pragmatic approach to bring about political change, citing international support for lifting the embargo and missed business opportunities. They also emphasize the suffering of the Cuban people due to the embargo and advocate for consistency in policies towards communist governments. On the other hand, opponents maintain that isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change, pointing to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 as a roadmap for normalization of relations.

Opponents argue that isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change, pointing to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 as a roadmap for normalization of relations. Public opinion polls show majority support for normalizing relations with Cuba, with some division among Cuban Americans in Florida. In 2014, a poll by Florida International University showed that 52% of Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County opposed the embargo, with 69% supporting the lifting of travel restrictions to Cuba. President Obama's new policy direction towards Cuba in 2014 received mixed reactions from Congress members, with some supporting it as beneficial for the U.S. and others criticizing it for not addressing human rights issues. The future of U.S.-Cuban relations is expected to be a contentious topic in the 114th Congress. The 114th Congress is likely to debate U.S.-Cuban relations, with Congress historically involved in policy through legislative initiatives and oversight. Key issues include travel restrictions, agricultural exports, democracy projects, Alan Gross's imprisonment, broadcasting to Cuba, terrorism, migration, anti-drug cooperation, and offshore oil development. Travel restrictions have been a contentious part of isolating Cuba for over 50 years, with changes over time. Travel restrictions to Cuba have been a contentious issue for over 50 years, with changes over time. Restrictions on travel and remittances are part of the overall embargo regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Enforcement of these restrictions increased under the George W. Bush Administration, with further tightening on travel and private remittances. The Obama Administration took legislative action in 2009 to ease restrictions on family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba. The Obama Administration lifted restrictions on family travel and cash remittances to Cuba in 2009. In 2011, further changes were made to ease travel and remittance restrictions, including increasing purposeful travel for religious, educational, and journalistic activities, allowing remittances to non-family members, and expanding airports for licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. These measures were similar to policies implemented by the Clinton Administration in 1999 but were later restricted by the Bush Administration. The Obama Administration lifted restrictions on family travel and cash remittances to Cuba in 2009. In 2011, further changes were made to ease travel and remittance restrictions, including increasing purposeful travel for religious, educational, and journalistic activities. The expansion of airports for licensed charter flights to and from Cuba was also allowed. OFAC delayed processing applications for new travel categories requiring a specific license until April 2011. People-to-people trips began in August 2011, with tightened restrictions in May 2012 requiring organizations to describe how the travel would enhance contact with the Cuban people and support civil society. In 2012, there were delays in the approval of licenses for people-to-people travel to Cuba, causing companies to cancel trips and lay off staff. However, by October 2012, companies reported receiving approvals again. In April 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z faced criticism for their trip to Cuba, with concerns that it was primarily for tourism and not meeting with oppressed individuals. The Treasury Department confirmed their participation in an authorized people-to-people exchange trip. The Treasury Department confirmed Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's participation in an authorized people-to-people exchange trip to Cuba, organized by a group licensed by OFAC. OFAC determined there were no apparent violations of U.S. sanctions, and a 2014 report by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General supported this. In April 2013, 59 House Democrats praised President Obama for easing travel restrictions to Cuba and called for further executive action to allow all categories of permissible travel under a general license. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba on December 17, 2014, including general licenses for travel and increased remittances. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include rights of Americans to travel and influencing conditions in Cuba. Arguments against lifting the ban include aiding Castro and the ability to travel to other countries with authoritarian governments. Legislative Activity in the first session of the 113th Congress involved different provisions in the FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure regarding Cuba travel restrictions. The House and Senate versions had conflicting provisions, but none were included in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure signed into law on January 17, 2014. The FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure, H.R. 2786, would have prohibited funding for people-to-people travel to Cuba, authorized by the Obama Administration in 2011. In contrast, the Senate version, S. 1371, would have expanded the general license for professional research and meetings in Cuba. The House version of the FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, H.R. 5016, includes provisions to restrict travel to Cuba. The FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, H.R. 5016, included provisions to restrict travel to Cuba. Congress did not complete action on H.R. 5016, and the FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure approved in December 2014 did not include the provisions on Cuba. Several legislative initiatives in the 113th Congress aimed to lift travel restrictions and embargo on Cuba. The 106th Congress passed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, allowing for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba. U.S. exports to Cuba have increased significantly since 2001, reaching a high of $712 million in 2008, largely due to rising food prices and Cuba's increased food purchases from the United States. U.S. exports to Cuba increased from $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004 and peaked at $712 million in 2008 due to rising food prices and Cuba's increased food needs after hurricanes. The U.S. was the largest supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba from 2002 to 2010. In 2011, Brazil became the largest supplier, but the U.S. regained the position in 2012. Exports declined in 2013 to $359 million and further to $243 million in the first nine months of 2014. U.S. exports to Cuba totaled $243 million in the first nine months of 2014, a decrease of 18% compared to 2013. Leading products included poultry, soybean oilcake, corn, and soybeans. Reasons for the decline in exports include Cuba's shortage of hard currency, credits offered by other governments, and perceived ineffectiveness of efforts to change U.S. sanctions policy. The U.S. International Trade Commission studied the impact of financing and travel restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba, estimating that lifting financing restrictions could increase U.S. share of Cuban imports. The U.S. International Trade Commission studied the impact of lifting financing and travel restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba. If these restrictions were lifted, U.S. exports to Cuba would increase significantly, with gains in fresh fruits, vegetables, milk powder, processed foods, wheat, and dry beans. The U.S. International Trade Commission found that lifting financing and travel restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba would significantly increase U.S. exports, benefiting products like wheat, rice, beef, pork, processed foods, and fish. Some groups support further easing restrictions to help U.S. agribusiness companies capitalize on the Cuban market, while opponents argue that current policy already allows for significant sales to Cuba. President Obama announced changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba in December 2014, including measures to boost Cuba's private sector with commercial sales and exports of agricultural equipment and building materials. The U.S. International Trade Commission found that lifting financing and travel restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba would significantly increase U.S. exports, benefiting products like wheat, rice, beef, pork, processed foods, and fish. President Obama announced changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba in December 2014, including measures to boost Cuba's private sector with commercial sales and exports of agricultural equipment and building materials. Private sector Cuban entrepreneurs will have access to agricultural equipment and building materials, with U.S. institutions allowed to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions for authorized transactions. Regulations implementing these changes will be issued in several weeks. Legislative efforts have been made to ease restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba in recent years. The 2005 action by OFAC regarding payment for agricultural goods from the United States to Cuba was objected to by U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress. The definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" was redefined for FY2010 and FY2011 to require payment before the transfer of title and control to the Cuban purchaser. However, this provision was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The Senate bill for FY2012 had a provision to continue the definition, but it was not included in the final legislation. The Senate bill in the 113th Congress included measures to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba, but other bills aimed to lift the overall embargo and restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba were not included in the final legislation. Additionally, a draft report in July 2014 proposed a review by the Treasury Department, Department of Commerce, and Department of Agriculture on the prohibition of U.S. private financing for sales of U.S. agricultural products. The Department is coordinating with the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture to review the impact of the prohibition on U.S. private financing for sales of U.S. agricultural commodities on small exporters and farmers. The provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure prevents the U.S. from accepting payment for trademark registrations and renewals from Cuban nationals related to confiscated assets without the original owner's consent. This measure was enacted due to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. over the Havana Club trademark. Bacardi and Pernod Ricard are in a dispute over the Havana Club trademark, with Bacardi claiming rights to the name through an agreement with the Arechabala family. Pernod Ricard, unable to market Havana Club in the US due to the trade embargo, seeks to protect its future distribution rights. The WTO found that the US law violating the TRIPS Agreement, leading to a deadline for compliance that was repeatedly extended. On July 1, 2005, in an EU-U.S. bilateral agreement, the EU agreed not to retaliate for non-compliance with a WTO ruling, but reserved the right to do so in the future. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration in August 2006, leading to legal battles that culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court declining to hear the case in May 2012. Bacardi began marketing Havana Club rum in the United States in 2006, leading to a legal battle with Pernod Ricard over the origin representation. Courts ruled in Bacardi's favor, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in May 2012. In Congress, debates continue on amending or repealing Section 211 to comply with WTO rulings. Debates in Congress continue on amending or repealing Section 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, which endangers trademarks of U.S. companies in Cuba. Various legislative initiatives have been introduced, but no action has been taken. Bills in the 113th Congress proposed different approaches, with some aiming for a narrow fix and others seeking to lift U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 reduced pressure on the issue. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 reduced pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. The United States has provided assistance to Cuba for democracy efforts through USAID and the State Department, with funding totaling $264 million from FY1996 to FY2014. The Administration's FY2015 request is for $20 million. The State Department and USAID have received funding for democracy efforts in Cuba, with the State Department receiving slightly more funding in recent years. Congress allocated specific amounts for assistance in FY2014, with a portion going to NED. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society, and human rights in Cuba. Some program partners include Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, Grupo de Apoyo a la Democracia, and International Relief and Development. The USAID's Cuba program received funding from various organizations such as Grupo de Apoyo a la Democracia, International Relief and Development, International Republican Institute, National Democratic Institute, New America Foundation, and Pan-American Development Foundation. The Administration requested $20 million in FY2012 for promoting democratic principles in Cuba, focusing on supporting independent elements of Cuban civil society. The programs aimed to strengthen associations, labor groups, marginalized groups, youth, legal associations, and women's networks. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2012 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill, S. 1601 ( S.Rept. 112-85 ), would have provided $15 million in ESF for Cuba, including humanitarian and democracy assistance, support for economic reform, private sector initiatives, and human rights. The committee expected funds to be used transparently for programs supporting Cuban civil society organizations and networking among various groups, documenting human rights violations, providing humanitarian assistance to political prisoners, and promoting leadership skills. Additionally, U.S. assistance aimed to disseminate information on market economies and economic rights. The House Appropriations Committee bill recommended $20 million in ESF for Cuba, to be used only for democracy-building purposes. USAID will administer $9.45 million of the funds for Cuba projects in FY2012. In May 2013, $20 million in Cuba projects for FY2012 will be administered by USAID, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. The funds will support human rights initiatives, civil society and media programs, and program support. For FY2013, the Administration requested $15 million for human rights and democracy programs in Cuba, focusing on promoting basic freedoms and providing humanitarian assistance to prisoners of conscience. The Senate and House versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations bill differed in funding for Cuba. The Senate proposed $15 million for humanitarian assistance, economic reform, and democracy, while the House suggested $20 million to promote democracy through the National Endowment for Democracy. Congress did not finalize appropriations before the fiscal year began. In September 2012, Congress approved a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 112-175) to continue FY2013 funding through March 27, 2013, with a 0.612% increase. Congress later approved H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6) for full-year FY2013 appropriations, including $19.283 million for Cuba democracy programs. The State Department will administer $17.783 million of the funding. The State Department will administer $17.783 million for Cuba democracy programs in FY2013, with $4.028 million dedicated to rule and human rights, $12.079 million for civil society programs, and $1.675 million for program management. The Administration also requested $15 million in FY2014 for projects supporting democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression in Cuba. The FY2014 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act allocated funds for Cuba democracy programs. The Senate and House versions differed in their allocation, with the House version providing $20 million for the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy in Cuba. Ultimately, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which included funding for Cuba programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $17.5 million for programs in Cuba, with $7.5 million going to the National Endowment for Democracy. The State Department was to administer the remaining $10 million. However, the Administration ended up providing $20 million for FY2014 Cuba democracy programs. For FY2015, the Administration requested the same amount of $20 million for Cuba democracy programs to support civil society initiatives promoting democracy. The FY2015 democracy program in Cuba will continue to support civil society initiatives promoting democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression. The program aims to strengthen independent civil society, facilitate information sharing, and provide humanitarian assistance to victims of political repression. The FY2015 Department of State appropriations bill allocated funds to promote democracy and civil society in Cuba, with restrictions on business promotion and economic reform. The Senate version included funding for USAID programs to support private businesses. The final omnibus appropriations measure did not specify an amount for ESF assistance to Cuba. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) receives funding from the U.S. government for its Cuba program. In FY2014, Congress allocated $7.5 million for democracy assistance in Cuba to NED, which is more than double the amount spent in FY2013. NED's funding for Cuba projects in recent years has ranged from $1.4 million to $3.4 million. In recent years, NED's funding for Cuba projects has ranged from $1.4 million to $3.4 million. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued several reports on these projects. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued reports on USAID and State Department democracy programs for Cuba, highlighting significant problems in management and oversight. Reports noted issues with internal controls, high shipping costs, and lax oversight, leading to diminished effectiveness. However, steps taken since 2006, such as competitive grant awards and improved oversight, have been praised by GAO. The GAO report highlighted steps taken by USAID to improve oversight of Cuba democracy programs, including competitive grant awards, increased staffing, and enhanced financial services. Recommendations were made to ensure proper staffing levels for effective grant oversight and to assess overall efforts to reduce grantee risks. Despite improvements in performance and financial monitoring, challenges remain in program oversight. In 2013, GAO reported improvements in USAID's financial monitoring of Cuba democracy programs, but found gaps in the State Department's monitoring. Recommendations were made to strengthen monitoring by using a risk-based approach for audits and obtaining more information on implementing partners. In 2014, an Associated Press report alleged that USAID had created a \"Cuban Twitter\" to undermine Cuba's government, which USAID strongly contested. The USAID project in Cuba, known as ZunZuneo, lasted over two years and was used by thousands of Cubans until it ended in 2012. USAID defended the program, stating it was not covert but maintained a discreet profile to minimize risks. Some Members of Congress criticized USAID for lack of transparency, while others defended the agency. In 2014, the Associated Press reported on another U.S.-funded democracy program for Cuba involving youth from Latin American countries sent to Cuba for civic programs with the alleged goal of identifying potential social-change actors. The AP report alleged that USAID was recruiting young Cubans for anti-government activism under the guise of civic programs. USAID defended their actions, stating they were supporting civil society programs. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, was imprisoned in Cuba for his work on a democracy project. Despite calls for his release, he remained in prison, hindering U.S.-Cuban relations. Cuba linked Gross's release to the \"Cuban five\", convicted of espionage in the U.S. The U.S. rejected this linkage. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, was arrested in Cuba for installing internet connections for Jewish communities. After 14 months in prison, he was charged with \"actions against the independence and territorial integrity of the state.\" After 14 months in prison, Alan Gross was officially charged in Cuba with \"actions against the independence and territorial integrity of the state\" and sentenced to 15 years. Despite appeals for his release on humanitarian grounds due to his deteriorating health and family circumstances, including his mother's lung cancer diagnosis and daughter's cancer treatment, his appeal was rejected. Efforts for a humanitarian visit to his sick mother in the U.S. were unsuccessful, contrasting with a Cuban convicted individual being granted a visit to his dying brother. Alan Gross's wife expressed concerns about his health in September 2012. In September 2012, Judy Gross expressed concern about her husband's health, who had lost over 100 pounds in prison. In November 2012, the Cuban government stated that Alan Gross was in normal health and did not have cancer. Alan and Judy Gross filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government and DAI, alleging failure to disclose risks. A settlement was reached with DAI in May 2013, and a judge dismissed the lawsuit against the U.S. government in May 2013. Gross's lawyers planned to appeal the dismissal. USAID agreed to pay $3.2 million to DAI in December 2014. In December 2014, USAID agreed to pay $3.2 million to DAI to resolve pending claims. During Gross's imprisonment, U.S. officials and Congress members called for his release. Judy Gross urged President Obama to prioritize her husband's case. The State Department and Senate also called for Gross's release. The resolution with 31 cosponsors called for the immediate release of Alan Gross from detention in Cuba. The State Department made his release a top priority, using diplomatic channels and seeking assistance from the Vatican. On Gross's 65th birthday, they expressed deep concern for his well-being and urged the Cuban government to release him. The State Department expressed deep concern for Alan Gross's well-being on his 65th birthday and called for his release from detention in Cuba. President Obama asked for help from Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica to raise the issue with Ra\u00fal Castro. Gross went on a hunger strike in protest of his treatment by both governments. His lawyer stated that Gross planned to return to his family within the year and would renew his hunger strike if not released. Alan Gross, imprisoned in Cuba, marked his 65th birthday on May 2, 2014, stating it would be his last if not released within the year. He suffered health issues and weight loss in captivity. Calls were made for his release, with some suggesting diplomatic efforts similar to those for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Gross's mother passed away, prompting pleas for his temporary release to be with his family. Alan Gross, imprisoned in Cuba, celebrated his 65th birthday on May 2, 2014, expressing that it could be his last if not released within the year due to health issues and weight loss. Calls for his release intensified, with concerns raised about his well-being. Ultimately, Cuba released Gross on humanitarian grounds on December 17, 2014, allowing him to return to the United States. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, aim to provide reliable news and information to the Cuban people through various media platforms. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was abolished in FY2000, with its functions merged into the Department of State. The BBG included entities like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). OCB, headquartered in Miami, FL, was relocated from Washington, DC, to South Florida in 1998. TV Mart\u00ed programming is broadcast 24/7 via the Internet and satellite television. In the 113th Congress, there was a proposal to abolish the BBG and create a new United States International Communications Agency. TV Mart\u00ed programming was initially broadcast via an aerostat until it was destroyed by a hurricane. It was then transmitted through various platforms like Commando Solo and AeroMart\u00ed. AeroMart\u00ed broadcasted live shows for five days a week but was eventually eliminated due to budget cuts in FY2014. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) utilizes web domains and anti-censorship tools for broadcasting. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) utilizes web domains and anti-censorship tools to reach Internet users in Cuba. They use SMS messaging to communicate with audiences and have various online platforms like martinoticias.com, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. Congress has allocated significant funding for broadcasting to Cuba, with recent years seeing around $27 million annually. Additional funding may be transferred to OCB from Economic Support Funds to restore program reductions. In FY2012, Congress approved full funding of $28.475 million for Cuba broadcasting, with actual spending at $27.977 million. For FY2013, the Administration requested $23.594 million, almost $4.5 million lower than the previous year's funding. The Administration requested $23.594 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year's funding. Program reductions were proposed due to OCB's streamlining and reliance on technical support from the BBG. The AeroMart\u00ed platform was proposed for elimination to save $2 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee-supported bill would have provided $23.4 million, slightly less than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee-supported bill would have provided $28.062 million, exceeding the Administration's request. In FY2013, Congress approved a continuing resolution for funding through March 27, 2013, with an across-the-board increase of 0.612%. In March 2013, Congress completed action on FY2013 appropriations with the approval of H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6), but funding reductions caused by sequestration were not stopped. The BBG's actual spending for OCB in FY2013 was $26.293 million, lower than the enacted level of $28.266 million due to sequestration. The BBG's actual spending for OCB in FY2013 was $26.293 million, lower than the enacted level of $28.266 million due to sequestration. In FY2014, the Administration requested $23.804 million for Cuba broadcasting, proposing program reductions including eliminating AeroMart\u00ed flights and two shortwave frequencies at night. Additionally, the BBG proposed eliminating seven OCB positions and reducing contractors and up to 50 OCB positions. The BBG's budget request for FY2014 included reducing contractors and up to 50 OCB positions. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $28.266 million for Cuba broadcasting, while the Senate proposed $23.804 million. Ultimately, Congress appropriated $27.043 million for Cuba broadcasting in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure. In FY2014, Congress appropriated $27.043 million for Cuba broadcasting, exceeding the Administration's request by $3.24 million. For FY2015, the Administration requested $23.130 million, anticipating a possible $5 million transfer from the ESF foreign aid account for Cuba democracy programs. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $28.266 million for FY2015, aiming to mitigate the impact of budget cuts. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure allocated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, with the intention to offset transmission and personnel costs. Funding may be transferred from ESF to restore program reductions. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies and funding cuts due to Cuban jamming efforts. Government studies and audits of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) from 1990 to 2008 found that Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have a small audience, with less than 2% of respondents tuning in. Concerns were raised about adherence to domestic laws and international standards, including inappropriate advertisements during programming. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified on issues with Radio and TV Mart\u00ed's programming, including inappropriate advertisements and interference with Cuban broadcasts. A Senate Foreign Relations Committee report in April 2010 criticized Radio and TV Mart\u00ed for failing to influence Cuban society effectively. Recommendations included moving the Office of Cuba Broadcasting back to Washington and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. In December 2011, GAO issued a report examining the Broadcasting Board of Governors' (BBG) strategic plan for broadcasting. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations measure (H.Rept. 111-366 to H.R. 3288 / P.L. 111-117) required the BBG strategic plan to include an analysis of broadcasting to Cuba, audience sizes for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, transmission costs, obstacles to increasing audience size, alternative dissemination options, and program efficiencies. The GAO found that the BBG's strategic plan lacked key information, but fully addressed the analysis of obstacles to increasing audience size. The GAO found that the BBG's strategic plan lacked key information, partially addressing five out of six requirements. The report suggested providing more information to Congress, including cost-saving opportunities. A controversy arose in May 2012 over an editorial by OCB Director Carlos Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez criticizing Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega, leading to questions about OCB's editorial policy and adherence to broadcast standards. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982 due to alleged ties to terrorism in Latin America. Countries on the terrorism list face restrictions on trade benefits and foreign aid under the Export Administration Act. Cuba's change in policy in 1992 was influenced by the breakup of the Soviet Union, leading to economic decline. Critics argue that keeping Cuba on the terrorism list is a Cold War relic, while supporters point to evidence of Cuba supporting terrorism in Latin America and Africa. Cuba has a history of supporting terrorist acts and armed insurgencies in Latin America and Africa. The State Department's 2013 terrorism report mentioned Cuba's hosting of members of foreign terrorist organizations like ETA and FARC. However, there was no evidence of Cuba providing weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups. Cuba has a history of harboring fugitives wanted in the United States, including convicted murderers and hijackers. Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army, escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba in 1984. In recent years, U.S. fugitives wanted for Medicare and insurance fraud have also reportedly fled to Cuba. On November 6, 2013, an American citizen who hijacked an airplane to Havana was identified as William Potts. In recent years, fugitives wanted for insurance fraud have fled to Cuba. William Potts, an American citizen who hijacked an airplane to Havana in 1984, returned to the United States in 2013 to face air-piracy charges after serving 14 years in a Cuban jail. Efforts have been made in Congress to extradite fugitives like William Morales from Cuba. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the United States on a case by case basis, but generally refuses to render fugitives judged as \"political.\" Cuba has generally refused to extradite fugitives judged as \"political\" to the U.S., citing concerns about fair trials. They have requested the return of Cuban criminals from the U.S. in exchange. Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force in 2012, committing to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Cuba is set to undergo a mutual evaluation in 2014 to assess its compliance. Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force in 2012 to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. In 2014, Cuba is scheduled for a GAFISUD mutual evaluation to assess its compliance with international standards. The President can remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list by certifying a change in leadership and policies or providing assurances of no support for terrorism. The EAA, FAA, and AECA authorize the designation of a foreign government as a state sponsor of terrorism. Only the AECA allows Congress to block the removal of a country from the list. H.R. 1917 in the 113th Congress proposed rescinding Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. President Obama instructed Secretary of State Kerry to review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, with the review guided by facts and law. The President emphasized that a nation renouncing terrorism should not face sanctions, especially when threats from groups like al Qaeda and ISIL are a priority. Cuba and the United States reached migration accords in 1994 and 1995 to prevent mass exoduses like the 1980 Mariel boatlift. U.S. officials vowed not to allow another mass exodus amid escalating tensions. In response to Fidel Castro's threat of another Mariel, President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy on August 19, 1994. Cubans rescued at sea would now be taken to Guantanamo Bay. Despite the policy change, Cubans continued to flee in large numbers. Talks between Cuba and the United States led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing by boat. The agreement ensured safe, legal, and orderly Cuban migration to the U.S., with a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants per year. In May 1995, another accord was reached for the U.S. to parole Cubans. In January 1996, the last of 32,000 Cubans intercepted at sea and housed at Guantanamo left the U.S. Naval Station, with most being paroled into the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea since the 1995 migration accord, returning them to Cuba. Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status after one year under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. Most interdictions result in a return to Cuba, while those who touch shore can apply for residency. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy allows Cubans who reach shore in the United States to stay, while those interdicted at sea are typically returned to Cuba. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated over the years, with reasons for the decline in interdictions including the U.S. economic downturn and more efficient patrolling. However, from FY2011 to FY2014, the number of interdictions increased annually, possibly due to Cuba's poor economic and political situation. The number of Cubans interdicted by the Coast Guard increased annually from 985 in FY2011 to 2,059 in FY2014. Speculated reasons for the increase included Cuba's poor economic and political situation, the Coast Guard's more efficient interdiction methods, and the easing of the economic situation in the United States. Despite the U.S. Coast Guard's efforts, thousands of unauthorized Cubans still reach the United States each year, either by boat or at land ports of entry. Border Patrol apprehensions of unauthorized Cubans in coastal Florida were significantly lower in recent years compared to FY2005-FY2008. In FY2012, Border Patrol apprehensions of Cubans were significantly lower than in FY2005-FY2008. Cubans prefer land-based entry at U.S. ports of entry, especially from Mexico. In FY2012, 11,383 Cubans presented themselves at land border ports of entry, rising to 14,251 in FY2013, with most at the southwest border. The number of Cubans entering the U.S. via the southwest border continued to increase in FY2014. U.S.-Cuban talks on migration accords were restarted by the Obama Administration in 2009. In 2009, talks on migration issues between the U.S. and Cuba began, with four rounds held until January 2011. After an 18-month break, talks resumed in July 2013 in Washington, DC. The State Department emphasized U.S. priorities on migration cooperation, aviation safety, and visa processing. Cuba ratified protocols against smuggling and trafficking. Discussions focused on deterring illegal migration and ensuring the safety of intending immigrants. The U.S. reiterated the call for the release of Alan Gross. The U.S. and Cuba ratified protocols against smuggling and trafficking in 2013. Subsequent migration talks in 2014 covered aviation security, consular document fraud, and visa processing. Cuba expressed concerns about banking services affecting consular operations in the U.S. Both governments agreed on search and rescue operation procedures to save lives. Cuba suspended consular services in the United States twice since late 2013 due to banking issues, but services were eventually restored. The Cuban government updated its migration policy in January 2013. The Cuban government updated its migration policy in January 2013, eliminating the requirement for an exit permit and letter of invitation for Cubans to travel abroad. The new policy allows Cubans to travel with just an updated passport and a visa from the destination country. The change aims to reduce brain drain and applies to all professionals, including healthcare workers. Thousands of Cubans lined up at migration offices when the policy took effect on January 14, 2013. The new Cuban migration policy, effective January 14, 2013, allows Cubans to travel with an updated passport and required visas. The U.S. State Department welcomed the change, citing human rights principles. Prominent dissidents like Yoani S\u00e1nchez have traveled abroad under the new policy. Analysts question if the U.S. should review its policy towards Cuban migrants. The State Department also made changes to non-immigrant B-2 visas for Cubans. Effective August 1, 2013, the State Department extended the validity of non-immigrant B-2 visas for Cubans to five years with multiple entries, aiming to strengthen people-to-people ties and ease travel burdens. Cuba faces challenges with drug smuggling due to its geographic location, with drugs mainly entering through onshore wash-ups or clandestine airfields in Jamaica. The Cuban government has expressed concerns about drug transit through its waters and airspace, taking measures to address the issue. The Cuban government has expressed concerns over drug transit through their waters and airspace, taking measures to address the issue. They have implemented legislation to stiffen penalties for traffickers, increased training for counternarcotics personnel, and cooperated with other countries on anti-drug efforts. Cuba has various anti-drug agreements in place with other countries and has focused on maritime and air interdiction to combat drug smuggling. They reported interdicting 3.05 metric tons of illegal narcotics in 2012, with the majority being wash-ups. Cuba has also pursued an internal enforcement program against its incipient drug market and conducted a nationwide drug prevention campaign. Cuba has increased cooperation with the United States on anti-drug efforts since 1996, when they seized 6.6 tons of cocaine aboard a ship bound for Miami. This cooperation has included upgrading communication links between Cuban Border Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, stationing a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana, and sharing tactical information on narcotics trafficking. Coordination has improved since the specialist was posted in 2000. The Coast Guard and Cuba have increased communication and cooperation on anti-drug efforts, including sharing tactical information on narcotics trafficking and holding professional exchanges on maritime drug interdiction. Cuba has expressed interest in a bilateral anti-drug cooperation agreement with the United States, with a draft accord still under review. The State Department acknowledges that such an accord could enhance counternarcotics efforts for both countries. The INCSR report highlighted the potential for increased counternarcotics cooperation between the United States, Cuba, and international partners. Senator Feinstein emphasized the importance of enhancing collaboration with Cuba on counternarcotics efforts, recommending steps for increased cooperation. Senator Feinstein recommended four steps to increase U.S. collaboration with Cuba on counternarcotics, including expanding Coast Guard presence in Havana and negotiating a bilateral agreement. Cuba faced setbacks in offshore oil development in 2012, but potential reserves could make it a significant oil producer in the future. Cuba's offshore oil production potential could reduce its dependence on Venezuela for oil supplies. In 2012, Cuba produced 51,000 barrels of oil per day onshore but consumed 171,000 barrels per day. Repsol's exploratory drilling in 2012 came up dry, leading to their departure in 2013. Other foreign companies have also been involved in offshore oil projects in Cuba. In 2012, foreign companies like Petronas, Gazprom, PdVSA, and Petrobras explored for oil off the coast of western Cuba, but all wells were found to be not commercially viable. Other companies like PetroVietnam, Sonangol, ONGC, Rosneft, and Zarubezhneft also had exploration agreements. The Scarabeo-9 oil rig left Cuba in November 2012 after three unsuccessful wells. In 2012, the Scarabeo-9 oil rig left Cuba after three unsuccessful wells, hindering the Cuban government's deepwater offshore hydrocarbon development efforts. Despite some agreements with Russian energy companies, skepticism remains about future drilling in Cuba's offshore deepwaters. In December 2012, Zarubezhneft faced technical challenges while drilling an exploratory oil well in a north coastal block east of Havana, leading to the project's halt in April 2013. In early April 2013, an oil rig company stopped work in Cuba and left in June 2013. Concerns were raised about Cuba's deepwater petroleum reserves after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The poor state of relations between Cuba and the United States complicates disaster preparedness and coordination in case of an oil spill. If an oil spill occurred northwest of Cuba, it could reach U.S. waters and coastal areas in Florida, posing risks to marine and coastal resources. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling suggested that Cuba's interest in deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico could have potential impacts. The United States and Cuba have participated in regional meetings since 2011 regarding oil spill prevention and response, along with other countries like Mexico, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. In March 2014, the countries finalized a document to cooperate on containment and response strategies in case of a spill. In March 2014, the United States, Cuba, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Jamaica finalized the Wider Caribbean Region Multilateral Technical Operating Procedures for Offshore Oil Pollution Response (MTOP). U.S. oil spill mitigation companies can be licensed to provide support in case of a spill, and the U.S. Coast Guard is prepared for immediate response. Some analysts urge easing regulatory restrictions for private companies to transfer equipment and personnel to Cuba for spill prevention. In the 112th Congress, there was strong interest in Cuba's offshore oil development, with concerns about potential oil spills leading to various legislative initiatives, none of which were enacted. Additionally, since 2000, 15 individuals, including two U.S. government officials, have been convicted of spying for Cuba. In November 2009, Kendall and Gwendolyn Myers pled guilty to spying for Cuba, with Kendall receiving a life sentence and Gwendolyn 81 months. Carlos Alvarez, an FIU professor, and his wife Elsa Prieto Alvarez were also convicted for espionage activities. The Bush Administration expelled 14 Cuban diplomats in 2003 for monitoring U.S. invasion preparations for Iraq. Cuba's spies stole information on U.S. invasion plans for Iraq and passed it to the Iraqi government. Ana Montes, a DIA analyst, was arrested for spying for Cuba, providing classified information for 16 years. She disclosed names of U.S. intelligence agents in Cuba and details on a \"special access program.\" Montes was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2002. In response, the State Department expelled four Cuban diplomats. In a related case, in 2013, a former USAID official, Marta Rita Velazquez, was charged with espionage for introducing Montes to Cuba. In April 2013, the Department of Justice unsealed a 2004 indictment charging former USAID official Marta Rita Velazquez with espionage for introducing Ana Montes to the Cuban Intelligence Service in 1984. Velazquez helped Montes gain employment at the DIA and resigned from USAID in 2002. In June 2001, five members of the \"Wasp Network\" were convicted on espionage charges in Miami, with sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison. The Cuban intelligence agents tried to infiltrate U.S. military bases and were convicted for various offenses. The \"Cuban Five\" were convicted for acting as unregistered Cuban intelligence agents in the United States, conspiracy to gather and transmit national defense information, and conspiracy to commit murder. They were involved in infiltrating Cuban exile groups and monitoring potential U.S. military actions against Cuba. Gerardo Hern\u00e1ndez received two life sentences for his alleged role in the deaths of four pilots from the Brothers to the Rescue group. The Cuban government is working for the return of the \"Cuban Five,\" who are considered \"Heroes.\" The Cuban government worked for the return of the \"Cuban five,\" who were convicted for acting as Cuban intelligence agents in the U.S. and were involved in monitoring U.S. military actions against Cuba. In 2008, an exchange offer for imprisoned Cuban dissidents was rejected by the State Department. In 2009, sentences for three of the five were reduced, and two were released from prison during the 113th Congress. During the 113th Congress, two of the \"Cuban five\" were released from prison and returned to Cuba. Ren\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez was released in October 2011 and faced probation in the United States. He was allowed to visit his dying brother in Cuba in March 2012. Gonz\u00e1lez renounced his U.S. citizenship in May 2013 and returned to Cuba. Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez was released in February 2014 and returned to Cuba the next day. Antonio Guerrero and Ram\u00f3n Laba\u00f1ino potentially could have been released in 2017 and 2024, respectively, while Gerardo Hern\u00e1ndez continued serving his sentence. On December 17, 2014, the remaining three Cuban spies in U.S. prison were released in exchange for Cuba's release of an important U.S. intelligence asset imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two decades. The U.S. intelligence asset was identified as Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a cryptographer who helped the FBI dismantle Cuban spy networks in the United States. Cuba had linked the release of the \"Cuban five\" to the release of Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor detained in 2009. On December 17, 2014, the remaining Cuban spies were released in exchange for an important U.S. intelligence asset, Rolando Sarraff Trujillo.
