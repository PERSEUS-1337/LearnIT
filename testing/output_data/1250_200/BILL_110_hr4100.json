    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period. States must apply for the grant and meet eligibility criteria. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for State educational agencies applying for grants to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency. These requirements include developing alternate assessments, selecting participating local education agencies, providing guidance on assessment tools and data collection, and ensuring implementation of a response to intervention approach. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for monitoring and oversight of local education agencies participating in a pilot program for students with disabilities. It also details the program elements, such as limiting student participation to 0.5 percent of the total population and ensuring the IEP Team determines the need for alternate assessments. The pilot program for students with disabilities requires participating local educational agencies to ensure appropriate assessment selection, quality instruction, and data analysis by the IEP Team to determine student performance levels in reading and math. The pilot program for students with disabilities requires local educational agencies to assess students who are significantly below grade level in reading or math using valid assessments. The IEP Team must then develop targeted interventions to address the identified gaps in instructional and grade-level knowledge. The data from these assessments cannot be used to determine proficiency levels or for accountability purposes under the Act. The pilot program requires local educational agencies to assess students significantly below grade level using valid assessments. Reports must document progress towards instructional level proficiency and closing the gap with grade level proficiency. State education agencies must submit annual reports on pilot participation and progress. The pilot program aims to close the gap between students' grade level proficiency and instructional level proficiency. Data collected will inform a report to Congress on student participation and progress. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2008."
