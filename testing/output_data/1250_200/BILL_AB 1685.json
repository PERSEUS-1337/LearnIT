    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 43016 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to impose civil penalties for violations of emission control laws, with a maximum penalty of $37,500 per violation. Violations related to portable fuel containers or small off-road engines may incur a penalty of up to $500 per unit. Manufacturers or distributors may be required to pay the penalty and ensure compliance with emission control laws to continue selling regulated products in California. The state board adjusts maximum penalties for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index, exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act. Penalties collected are deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund. Section 43151 prohibits the sale, import, or use of uncertified motor vehicles or engines in California. The article does not apply to a vehicle acquired to replace a damaged or stolen vehicle, a vehicle transferred by inheritance or court decree, or a vehicle sold after a specific legislative amendment date if it was registered before that date. The chapter does not apply to a motor vehicle with a federal Clean Air Act certificate of conformity originally registered in another state by a resident who later moves to this state. Violations of emission control laws may result in a civil penalty of up to $37,500 per action, with manufacturers or distributors potentially required to pay the penalty and make vehicles compliant for continued sale in the state. The state board may impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 on a dealer violating emission control laws, with adjustments for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index. Penalties collected will be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund. Penalties can be recovered in the superior court by the Attorney General on behalf of the state board or by local authorities. Section 43211 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to impose civil penalties on manufacturers who sell new motor vehicles in California that fail to meet emission standards. The penalties can reach up to $37,500 per vehicle and $5,000 per zero-emission vehicle credit. The state board will adjust the maximum penalty for inflation. Penalties collected will go into the General Fund. Section 43212 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to impose civil penalties on manufacturers or distributors who do not comply with emission standards. The penalty can reach up to $37,500 per vehicle sold in California that does not meet the standards. Any penalty recovered will be deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund. The state board may order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to bring its vehicles into compliance with certified emissions configuration. Compliance may be required for continued sale in California. Penalty recovered will go to the Air Pollution Control Fund."
