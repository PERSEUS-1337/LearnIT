The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014 establishes a Governmentwide Federal energy policy and recommends regular updates through strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews. The Department of Energy conducts a Quadrennial Technology Review to coordinate energy technology policies and programs, serving as a basis for collaboration with other agencies. A Quadrennial Energy Review aims to set national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, and identify necessary resources. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish a Governmentwide Federal energy policy, coordinate actions across agencies, identify resources for energy technologies, and provide a strong analytical base for policy decisions. It should take into account budgetary resources, enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. Input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, NGOs, and the public is essential. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish a Governmentwide Federal energy policy, coordinate actions across agencies, identify resources for energy technologies, and provide a strong analytical base for policy decisions. It should consider budgetary resources, enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. Input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, NGOs, and the public is essential. Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act is amended to focus on the Quadrennial Energy Review. In this section, key definitions include the Director as the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the term Federal Laboratory encompassing federally funded research centers, the Interagency Energy Coordination Council, and the Quadrennial Energy Review focusing on energy programs and technologies. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013 establishes an Interagency Energy Coordination Council to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review. The council is comprised of representatives from the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce. The Quadrennial Energy Review is conducted for various federal departments and agencies, providing an integrated view of national energy objectives and policies. It aims to align research programs, incentives, regulations, and partnerships. The review is submitted to Congress for consideration. The Quadrennial Energy Review is a report submitted to Congress every four years by the President. It includes an integrated view of short-, intermediate-, and long-term objectives for Federal energy policy, anticipated Federal actions, and an analysis of the prospective roles of various parties. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes an analysis of the prospective roles of parties in achieving energy objectives, requirements for energy technology development, and policy options to increase domestic energy supplies and efficiency. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes an assessment of policy options to increase domestic energy supplies and efficiency, evaluation of energy storage, transmission, and distribution requirements, an integrated plan for Federal Laboratories' involvement in energy programs, portfolio assessments for optimal resource deployment, mapping of linkages among research and innovation programs, identification and projections for demonstration projects, and identification of public and private funding needs for energy technologies. The curr_chunk provides an identification of public and private funding needs for various energy technologies, assessment of global competitors, identification of policy gaps to accelerate technology adoption, a priority list for implementation, and analysis of points of maximum policy leverage. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for executive branch organization changes to facilitate the development and implementation of Federal energy policies, including the preparation of interim reports and the provision of an Executive Secretariat for the Quadrennial Energy Review. The curr_chunk states that applicable Federal agencies must cooperate with the Secretary to provide assistance for the Energy Review. Additionally, it clarifies that the Act does not override any existing Federal laws unless explicitly stated."
