    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm subsidies on targeted imports. In a 2007 investigation on coated free sheet paper from China, the ITA changed its stance on applying CVD laws to nonmarket economy countries like China, citing the ability to identify subsidies. The ITA determined in a 2007 investigation that subsidies could be identified in China due to market principles in many industries. China was previously designated as a nonmarket economy country, but the 2007 subsidy decision was specific to China and not applicable to other nonmarket economy countries. NME designations are based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, government control of production means, and resource allocation. The ITA designated NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. China, designated as an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner with a significant trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit with China has led to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products, particularly concerning alleged illegal subsidy programs. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place. Concerns also exist about China's undervalued currency making its exports cheaper. The undervalued Chinese currency has led to concerns about its impact on the U.S. trade deficit and competitiveness of American industries. This issue has sparked congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The applicability of Non-Market Economy (NME) classification for China was determined in previous ITA rulings. The ITA reaffirmed the determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value for Greige Polyester Cotton Print Cloth from China in 2006. The NME designation for China may only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package. The ITA had not initiated countervailing action against China since 1991 until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. The United States and other World Trade Organization (WTO) members can no longer use nonmarket economy or \"surrogate country\" methodology in CVD or AD investigations after 15 years from the date of accession (or December 11, 2016). The earlier countervailing duty laws required a determination of subsidization and a finding of injury to a U.S. domestic industry. The countervailing duty laws, applicable to products from countries not \"under the Agreement,\" were repealed in 1995. These laws allowed for levying a duty equal to the amount of subsidization without requiring an injury determination. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 expanded these provisions to include countries \"under the Agreement\" and implemented international Subsidies and Countervailing Code. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-39) implemented the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations. It required a determination of subsidy provision and injury to U.S. industry for countervailing duty assessment. The URAA amended this law by omitting subsidies from private sources as countervailable and incorporating provisions not requiring injury determination in countervailing investigations. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 incorporated provisions from section 303 without injury determination for countervailing investigations of subsidized imports. Investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated based on allegations of public benefits like multiple exchange rates and industry-specific trade conversion coefficients. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 included provisions from section 303 for countervailing investigations of subsidized imports without injury determination. Czechoslovakia and Poland had specific trade practices such as industry-specific trade conversion coefficients and tax exemptions for foreign trade earnings. Both countries were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries by the ITA. The ITA addressed the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries in preliminary determinations for carbon steel wire rod cases. They found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the law based on statutory terms and legislative history. The ITA considered the effects of government intervention in market and nonmarket economies before deciding not to exclude nonmarket economies without further review. The ITA, in its analysis of government intervention in market and nonmarket economies, found that nonmarket economies are not automatically excluded from countervailing duty law. They highlighted how prices in nonmarket economies are set by central planners without reflecting scarcity or abundance, leading to a different understanding of subsidies compared to market economies. The ITA then scrutinized alleged subsidization programs to determine their impact in a market economy context. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they confer subsidies in market and nonmarket economies. They found that certain programs did not constitute bounties or grants under the CVD law for Czechoslovak and Polish practices. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. In the final phase of the investigations, the ITA addressed the issue of applying the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. Congress had not directly debated or legislated on this issue in 1974 or 1979 when amendments were made to the CVD law. The Trade Act of 1974 included provisions for injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries, which are equivalent to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA addressed the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries, noting Congress' recognition of the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to the ineffectiveness of traditional trade remedies in these economies. The Trade Act of 1974 included provisions for injurious imports from such countries. The ITA discussed the challenges of applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries, highlighting the difficulty in identifying and quantifying subsidies in these economies. The lack of market reference points makes it hard to determine if a sale is subsidized, leading to uncertainty in measuring resource transfers from the state to producers. The ITA concluded that NMEs like Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Investigations into subsidization of potassium chloride from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union were initiated based on petitions filed by U.S. chemical manufacturers. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations in NME countries due to lack of bounties or grants. A countervailing duty investigation on Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China was initiated based on a petition claiming market principles in the PRC fan sector. The ITA introduced the concept of market-oriented industry (MOI) in antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries to determine fair market value. In the Chinese fan CVD case, the ITA found that the Chinese fan industry was not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the case. The U.S. Court of International Trade held that countervailing duty law covers countries with nonmarket economies, reversing previous decisions and ordering investigations to be resumed. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed previous decisions and ordered investigations to be resumed regarding countervailing duty law covering countries with nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that subsidies can be found in nonmarket economies, contrary to the ITA's interpretation. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed decisions and ordered investigations to resume on countervailing duty law for countries with nonmarket economies. The ITA attempted to exempt nonmarket economy countries from subsidies, contradicting the CVD statute. The court emphasized that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies and that the ITA must investigate regardless of the economy's form. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed decisions and ordered investigations to resume on countervailing duty law for countries with nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies and that the ITA must investigate regardless of the economy's form, dismissing the ITA's argument about Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws and found that the countervailing duty statute had remained unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to Congress not defining certain terms. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the countervailing duty statute, which has remained unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to Congress not defining certain terms. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the countervailing duty statute, which remained unchanged since 1897. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the law. The Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order in the wire rod and potash cases, triggering immediate reaction in Congress with the introduction of H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress. H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress proposed applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries, with detailed procedural provisions. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced but not further considered. The issue was revisited in the 103rd and 104th Congresses. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries, prescribing the determination of subsidies using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical bills in subsequent Congresses aimed to extend the CVD duty law to NME countries for investigations of subsidies. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, with provisions included in broader trade-remedial legislation. The Fair Trade with China Act of 2005 focused on trade issues with China but subjected all NME countries to countervailing action. The provision in H.R. 1498 aimed to subject all NME countries, including China, to countervailing action for alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation. Several bills in the 110th Congress sought to apply countervailing duty law to NME countries. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The bills aimed to prevent the ITA from granting market economy treatment to individual businesses. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to prevent the ITA from granting market economy treatment to individual businesses in nonmarket economies. They also proposed a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies, considering the challenges in identifying and calculating subsidy amounts. Authorities would be directed to adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China when determining subsidy amounts, with the option to use terms outside of China if necessary. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to prevent the ITA from granting market economy treatment to individual businesses in nonmarket economies. They proposed a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies, directing authorities to adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China when calculating subsidy amounts. If China is deemed an NME country, authorities are to presume special difficulties exist and use terms prevailing outside of China to calculate subsidies. The bills also outline a process for revoking a country's NME status with a joint resolution of Congress. The Bush Administration took steps in 2006 to address China's alleged export subsidies through CVD investigations and WTO consultations. In late 2006, the ITA initiated a CVD investigation on China's alleged subsidies of exports. The ITC preliminarily determined that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination confirmed that countervailable subsidies were being provided to producers. The ITA's final determination in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China found subsidies ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as a non-market economy, the ITA noted significant differences in China's present-day economy compared to Soviet-style economies. The state plays a significant role in China's economy, controlling investment decisions, money and credit allocation, wage bills, and access to foreign currency. Private ownership is limited to consumer goods. The ITA found subsidies in the CVD investigation on CFS paper from China. Despite China being a non-market economy, the ITA noted differences in its economy. The state controls investment, money allocation, wage bills, and access to foreign currency. Private ownership is limited to consumer goods. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper. This was due to the modest increase in production capacity in China and Indonesia. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper from China and Indonesia. The investigation was terminated, and all estimated duties deposited or bonds posted were refunded or canceled. The ITA found subsidies in the CVD investigation on CFS paper from China, despite it being a non-market economy. The ITA found subsidies in the CVD investigation on CFS paper from China, leading to countervailing duties being imposed on 13 products from China. A subsequent investigation resulted in the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. China filed a lawsuit to prevent the ITA from continuing with the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. The Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case regarding the ITA's authority to apply countervailing duty law to NMEs. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States over antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. China has been active in AD investigations against the US and initiated its first CVD case in 2009. The US requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, including tax laws and other measures that provide unfair advantages to Chinese businesses. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs, but the USTR stated that these subsidies can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and inhibit exports to China. On November 29, 2007, USTR Schwab announced that China agreed to terminate illegal subsidies by January 1, 2008. China signed MOUs with the US and Mexico to eliminate WTO-prohibited subsidies. In 2010, USTR confirmed China had eliminated the subsidies. Despite challenges, a settlement in December 2009 confirmed China's removal of export-contingent benefits. Congress considered legislation to combat unfair trade practices. The ITA can identify subsidies in China, prompting Congress to consider legislation to combat unfair trade practices. Congress may need to ensure that CVD laws apply to other nonmarket economy countries like Vietnam. Other NME countries have limited trade significance currently. The trade significance of certain nonmarket economy countries (Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) is currently low, with no outstanding trade disputes. There are no specific methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. Countervailing duties tend to be lower than antidumping duties, especially for imports from nonmarket economy countries. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the uncertainty in determining the total level of protection for Chinese products due to the potential revision of antidumping (AD) duties to avoid double counting of export subsidies. This could lead to an unintended reduction in overall protection. However, targeting subsidies in China or amending the statute could also provide relief to U.S. industries through countervailing duty (CVD) procedures."
