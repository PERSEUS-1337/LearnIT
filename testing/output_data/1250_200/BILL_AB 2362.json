    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 4777 of the Civil Code to require written notification to owners and tenants in common interest developments when pesticides are applied by homeowner associations or their agents, similar to existing law for licensed pest control operators. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including definitions for \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"licensed pest control operator,\" \"pest,\" and \"pesticide.\" An association or its agent must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator, including information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Unlicensed use is allowed based on scientific evidence of minimal risks if used properly. Contact a healthcare provider if experiencing symptoms after pesticide exposure. For more information, contact the County Health Department or Department of Pesticide Regulation. The association or its authorized agent must provide notice at least 48 hours before applying pesticides. Individual notice must be given to owners and tenants of separate interests and adjacent separate interests. For common areas, written notice should be posted if practicable, otherwise individual notice must be given to adjacent separate interests. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association or its agent must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery. Owners or tenants can agree in writing to immediate pesticide application. Prior to written notification, oral agreement for immediate application is possible if requested. (iii) If an owner or tenant of a separate interest or an adjacent separate interest is required to be notified for immediate pesticide application, the association must provide written notice as soon as possible after the oral agreement is made, but no later than the commencement of pesticide application. A copy of the written notice must be attached to the minutes of the board meeting following the pesticide application."
