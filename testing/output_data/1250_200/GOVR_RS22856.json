    "content": "Most federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS enrollees do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS enrollees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS enrollees receive employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects spouses and former spouses of private-sector plan participants. ERISA and Title 5 of the United States Code govern retirement benefits for federal employees, with similar requirements for spousal rights and survivor benefits. Both ERISA and Title 5 mandate a joint and survivor annuity as the default form of benefit, along with written consent for beneficiary designations. Title 5, like ERISA, mandates a joint and survivor annuity as the default benefit for CSRS and FERS, requiring written consent to waive it. However, ERISA allows for earlier payment to former spouses in divorce cases, while Title 5 prohibits any payments until the federal employee has separated from service and applied for an annuity. Another difference is in defined contribution plan beneficiary designations. The difference between ERISA and Title 5 lies in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. ERISA requires spousal consent to name a beneficiary, while federal regulations allow participants in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone without spousal consent. State court decrees can award former spouses a share of retirement annuities or survivor annuities. OPM will only pay benefits specified in court orders. Section 8346 of Title 5 exempts CSRS from state court proceedings, but Section 8345 allows former spouses to be awarded benefits. Section 8345 of Title 5 allows former spouses of federal employees to receive a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity as directed by a state court decree. OPM will divide the annuity as specified in the court order and pay the former spouse. The right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death unless a survivor annuity is specified in the court order. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or if a state court decree requires it. The survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity, funded by a reduction in the worker's annual pension. The total amount of CSRS survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse has died or remarried. An annuity awarded to a former spouse through a court order does not entitle the employee's current spouse to a survivor annuity unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. The survivor annuity paid to a former spouse of a federal employee ends upon the former spouse's death or remarriage before age 55, except in cases where the marriage lasted at least 30 years. The annuity can be restarted in case of remarriage ending in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity election or court order must be made before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their right to it. If an employee opts for a refund of retirement contributions upon separation, they forfeit the survivor annuity. When a federal employee separates from service, they may choose to receive a refund of their retirement contributions, forfeiting their right to a survivor annuity. State courts can block the refund payment if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the annuity. For FERS retirement, a court decree can divide the annuity between the annuitant and former spouse. OPM will only divide payments after receiving the court order, and the former spouse's right to the annuity share ends upon certain conditions. When a federal employee separates from service, they may choose to receive a refund of their retirement contributions, forfeiting their right to a survivor annuity. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity terminates when the retiree dies. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse is 50% of the retiree's single-life annuity, funded by a 10% reduction. An employee may provide for only one FERS spouse survivor annuity. An employee's survivor annuity under FERS is limited to one spouse, with the total amount paid to all spouses not exceeding 50% of the annuitant's single-life annuity. If a former spouse receives the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. The annuity ends upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before age 55, with exceptions for remarriages lasting at least 30 years. Any modifications to the survivor annuity election or court order must be made before the employee's retirement. The FERS survivor annuity can be modified before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their right to it. If an employee dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum benefit. If the employee dies after 10 years of service, the spouse receives a lump sum and annuity. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a FERS annuity. A separating employee forfeits the right to a FERS annuity by refunding contributions to the retirement system. A state court can block the refund if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the FERS retirement annuity. Beneficiaries for TSP account balance must be designated using Form TSP-3. Spouse consent is required for certain actions involving the TSP account for married FERS participants. When withdrawing money from the TSP after leaving federal employment, CSRS participants do not need spousal consent. However, the spouse will be notified before a loan is approved or in case of a withdrawal. Married FERS participants' spouses are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit from the TSP, requiring written consent to withdraw funds. The TSP can recognize state court orders for divorce, annulment, property settlements, alimony, and child support. Former spouses of FERS workers may be eligible for a Social Security spouse's benefit at age 62 if married for at least 10 years. Remarriage generally disqualifies them from collecting benefits. If a former spouse of a worker insured by Social Security remarries, they generally cannot collect benefits on the worker's record unless the marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. However, the divorced spouse can receive widow or widower benefits if the couple was married for at least 10 years. Survivor benefits stop if the divorced spouse remarries before age 60 unless the later marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. Remarriage does not impact Social Security survivor benefits for the deceased worker's children."
