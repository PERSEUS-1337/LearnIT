    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000\" or \"Jeanna's Act.\" Congress finds that States are increasingly using private prisoner transport companies for violent prisoners due to fiscal or logistical concerns. Escapes have occurred during these transports, necessitating oversight by the Attorney General. While most prefer using trained law enforcement officers, using specialized private companies is an option. Government entities should not be required to contract with private companies, but if they choose to, proper precautions must be taken. Private prisoner transport companies used for moving violent prisoners should be regulated to enhance public safety. The Act defines key terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" It also discusses the federal regulation of prisoner transport companies. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees involved in prisoner transport. Training will focus on areas such as restraints, searches, and the use of force. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines include training in restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. There are restrictions on employee duty hours, minimum standards for supervising violent prisoners, uniform requirements for transportation officers, and identification standards for employees. Categories of violent prisoners must wear brightly colored clothing for easy identification. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners include standards for identifying prisoners, requirements for restraints, notification protocols for law enforcement, and safety standards in accordance with Federal and State law. Minimum safety standards for violent prisoners must comply with Federal and State law, with exceptions for private transport companies compared to federal agencies like the US Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Violators of regulations under this Act may face civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation, restitution to entities for costs related to apprehending escaped violent prisoners due to violations, as outlined in section 4(a)."
