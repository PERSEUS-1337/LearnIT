Recognizing the value of outstanding elementary and secondary school teachers, the Act proposes a program where these educators can contribute their expertise to education programs in government roles. The Act aims to establish a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, who will be known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". The Act defines key terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit organization administering the fellowship program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"outstanding\" for math or science teachers with specific achievements. The Act defines key terms related to the fellowship program, including \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Teachers must meet specific criteria to participate in the program, such as receiving national or State recognition and taking a sabbatical leave from teaching. The Fellowship Program is authorized under Section 5 of the Act. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program allows the Secretary to provide fellowships to outstanding math or science teachers.
