    "content": "From the mid-1970s until 2007, world markets experienced five significant spikes in crude oil and petroleum product prices due to supply disruptions and international conflicts. Elevated petroleum prices impact the United States' trade balance and reduce disposable income. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent oil embargo imposed by OAPEC. While strategic stocks cannot fully protect against market price fluctuations, they can help in supply emergencies. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and subsequent oil embargo. It was created to help prevent economic dislocation caused by supply disruptions and to mitigate sharp price spikes in the event of an interruption. The availability of strategic stocks can help blunt the market's reaction to a crisis and discourage the use of oil as a political weapon. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and subsequent oil embargo to calm markets, mitigate price spikes, and reduce economic dislocation. The SPR contains enough crude oil to replace imports for 90 days, with plans for expansion to 1 billion barrels. Managed by the Department of Energy, the SPR comprises five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana, utilizing salt domes for storage. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) stores crude oil to stabilize markets and prevent price spikes. Oil is removed by displacing it with water injection, and the SPR's capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005. Crude stored in the SPR remains undisturbed unless sold or exchanged. Loans of SPR oil are repaid with larger amounts, and the inventory was nearly filled to capacity by the end of 2009. Oil from the SPR is sold competitively through a Notice of Sale process, with bids reviewed by the Department of Energy. Oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after a sale notice, with an initial drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day. The Department of Energy estimates that oil could enter the market about two weeks after a sale notice. The SPR's initial drawdown rate is around 4.4 million barrels per day for up to 90 days, with a gradual decline thereafter. Concerns about the readiness of SPR facilities were alleviated after the successful drawdown during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. A Life Extension Program was initiated in 1993 to upgrade or replace aging systems, ensuring the SPR's readiness until 2025. The Arab oil embargo led to the establishment of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which includes strategic stocks as part of its International Energy Program (IEP). IEA members commit to maintaining emergency reserves equivalent to 90 days of net imports and developing demand restraint programs for energy crises. The International Energy Agency (IEA) requires member nations to maintain emergency reserves equal to 90 days of net imports. The United States has over 100 days' worth of reserves, but only about 20% of privately held stocks would be available in an emergency. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) could provide the US with roughly 70 days of protection, depending on economic recovery. The scenario of a total cessation of oil supply is unlikely, especially for the US, as Canada is a major source of crude oil. Some IEA members mandate private sector stocks to be held for emergencies. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the US is the main source of crude oil, with two-thirds of stocks held by the oil industry and one-third by governments. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the expansion of the SPR to 1 billion barrels. Congress approved funds for expansion, including evaluating a site in Richton, MS, and purchasing a cavern at Bayou Choctaw. However, the priority of expansion is unclear. The conferees accepted language in the Senate version of the bill that prohibits SPR appropriations expended to anyone engaged in providing refined products to Iran or contributing to the expansion of refining capacity in Iran. Firms providing or insuring tankers carrying refined product to Iran would also be included in the prohibition. Congress enacted additional drawdown authority in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which triggered spot shortages and price increases. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) authorities permanent, allowing for a limited use of the SPR in the event of a significant energy supply shortage. This authority was granted after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1990, which led to spot shortages and price increases. The SPR can be used without declaring a severe energy supply interruption, and also allows for U.S. participation in emergency-sharing activities of the International Energy Agency. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) authorities permanent, allowing for a limited use of the SPR in the event of a significant energy supply shortage. This authority permits the sale of up to 30 million barrels over 60 days if the SPR level is above 500 million barrels. Legislation is being considered to alter the authorities governing drawdown and sale from the SPR, including transferring drawdown authority from the President to the Secretary of Energy. The proposed legislation, S. 1462, aims to amend the authorities governing drawdown and sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). It would transfer drawdown authority from the President to the Secretary of Energy and allow drawdown in the event of a \"severe energy market disruption\" causing a significant increase in petroleum product prices. This is a departure from existing authorities which focus on supply disruptions. The refined product reserves could be drawn down to mitigate impacts of severe energy market supply disruptions caused by weather-related events or acts of nature. The proposed legislation aims to amend authorities governing drawdown and sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), transferring drawdown authority to the Secretary of Energy in the event of a \"severe energy market disruption\" causing a significant increase in petroleum product prices. Historically, the use of the SPR is based on a physical shortage of supply, but price was deliberately kept out of the authorities as grounds for a drawdown to avoid influencing private sector inventory practices. High prices in 2008 were not associated with shortages but with international supply concerns. Policymakers urged the release of crude from the SPR, but a drawdown would have had little impact on price due to slumping demand. The Bush Administration planned to release crude from the SPR, but it would not have significantly affected prices due to slumping demand. Legislation would require a report on acquiring refined products for the Reserve efficiently. Arguments for a refined product reserve include the efficiency of not needing to draw down the SPR first. Arguments for establishing a refined product reserve include the efficiency of not needing to draw down the SPR first, addressing scenarios where refineries or oil pipelines are compromised, and preventing overwhelming of U.S. port facilities. Arguments against it include the increased availability of gasoline from abroad and the higher cost of storing refined products compared to crude. The cost of storing crude in salt caverns is estimated at $3.50/barrel, while above-ground storage for refined products can cost $15-$18/barrel. Legislation in 2008 prohibited new activities to acquire oil for the SPR, but plans to resume filling the reserve were announced in 2009. The resumption includes a purchase of nearly 10.7 million barrels. The government resumed filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by purchasing oil to replace what was sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, returning borrowed oil, delivering deferred oil, and resuming fill at a volume of 26,000 barrels per day. The goal is to reach the SPR's capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. The last outright oil purchase for the SPR was in 1994, and the SPR held 592 million barrels. Interest in replenishing the SPR grew due to reduced federal budget deficits and falling oil prices in the late 1990s. The government's interest in replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) grew due to reduced federal budget deficits and falling oil prices in the late 1990s. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson proposed including $100 million in the FY2000 budget for oil purchases to support struggling domestic producers. An alternative proposal suggested accepting oil royalties from Gulf of Mexico leases \"in kind\" instead of as revenues, despite initial resistance from the Department of the Interior. President Bush ordered the fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 700 million barrels in 2001, mainly through royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquisitions. The RIK plan was initially seen as a positive step towards filling the SPR, but controversy arose as crude prices surged in 2002. Critics argued that diverting RIK oil to the SPR instead of selling it on the open market was contributing to price pressures, though the Administration disagreed. Industry analysts believed the quantity of SPR fill was not significant enough to impact the market. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Energy to develop procedures for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, considering factors like revenue loss, price impacts, and national security. DOE's final rule in 2006 outlined acquisition parameters without tying decisions to specific oil price differentials. In 2007, DOE resumed RIK fill of the SPR. In 2008, Congress passed P.L. 110-232 as gasoline prices rose. DOE estimated deliveries of 19.1 million barrels of RIK oil in FY2008. Opponents of RIK fill in the 110th Congress objected to government-owned strategic petroleum stock. Opponents of RIK fill argued that government-owned strategic petroleum stock was inappropriate, as it shifted the cost burden from the private sector to the public sector. RIK fill resumed in 2009 and will end in early 2010 pending additional storage establishment. Expansion of the SPR in Richton, MS, was considered, but it is unclear if it is a high priority despite budget allocation. The history of the SPR reflects debates on what constitutes a severe energy supply interruption, with recent price increases in products and crude oil leading to uncertainties. In recent years, there have been price increases in products and crude oil, even without measurable shortages in crude supply. Legislation in Congress aims to allow drawdowns of the SPR and Northeast Heating Oil Reserve in the event of a \"severe energy supply disruption,\" which now includes a price component in the definition. The debate over when to initiate a drawdown of SPR oil reflects changes in oil markets since the 1970s. The debate over the appropriate time to call upon the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was renewed due to the rise in oil prices from 2005-2008. The Reagan Administration's SPR Drawdown Plan in 1982 allowed for price-competitive sale of SPR oil without conditioning it on any trigger or formula. Some argued that early drawdown of the SPR was essential to moderate price effects triggered by shortages, while others believed in relying on the marketplace during shortages to avoid disruptions caused by price and allocation regulations. During the spring of 1996, the Reagan Administration revised its position on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) drawdown, announcing it would be used early in a disruption. This new policy aimed to ease congressional discontent and had international implications. Analysts emphasized the importance of coordinating stock drawdowns worldwide during emergencies to prevent stock transfers and maintain price stability. The International Energy Agency agreed \"in principle\" to an early drawdown in July 1984. This debate resurfaced after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, with concerns about a potential worldwide crude shortfall. The debate over using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 centered on whether to use it to moderate price increases before physical shortages occurred. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR solely to lower prices, while others argued that perceived shortages can cause immediate damage. It was later realized that in a decontrolled market, shortages are more likely to result in higher prices rather than physical scarcity. During the Persian Gulf War in January 1991, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was activated to address potential oil supply disruptions. Despite criticism, a drawdown of over 17 million barrels was sold to stabilize markets. This experience highlighted the need to optimize SPR deployment in decontrolled markets. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was deployed during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to address oil supply disruptions. Legislation has expanded the SPR's drawdown authority to prevent shortages from escalating. Exchanges allow companies to borrow SPR crude and replace it later. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY1996 to help finance the program. This led to three sales totaling 28.1 million barrels, raising $544.7 million. The sales were used for various purposes, including decommissioning, reducing the federal budget deficit, and offsetting appropriations. Fill of the SPR with RIK oil was initiated to replace the volume sold.

Fill of the SPR with RIK oil was initiated to replace the volume sold. Growth in oil demand had begun to strain U.S. refinery capacity before Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita in 2005, altering the historic correlation between crude oil and refined oil product prices. The traditional correlation between crude and product prices was disrupted in the early 2000s due to pressure on product supplies and international tensions. Increases in gasoline and petroleum product prices post-hurricanes were due to shortages in product supplies, not crude. The rise in crude prices to over $140/barrel by the summer of 2008 was due to various factors, including increasing international demand and concerns about potential production shortages. Market conditions were described as \"tight,\" with little spare production capacity. Refinery outages and weekly reports of U.S. crude and petroleum stocks could lead to spikes in prices. Some argued that the high prices were not supported by market conditions. Significant and sustained increases in oil prices were observed in the absence of severe energy supply interruptions. Legislation in the Senate (S. 1462) proposed a price basis for authorizing a drawdown of the SPR. Despite calls to release oil from the SPR in 2008, a release may not necessarily lower prices. By mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices exceeded $4.00/gallon and crude oil prices briefly surpassed $145/barrel before declining. Oil prices had risen without the usual association with disruptions. Oil prices rose to over $145/barrel before dropping to under $128/barrel. The increase was driven by factors like limited oil production capacity, inelastic demand, international tensions, and the value of the U.S. dollar. Legislation for a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed in July 2008, but was included in the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act passed in September. The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, passed in September, included a provision for the sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR within six months. This sale aimed to address issues with the compatibility of oil grades in the SPR with refinery trends towards heavier crudes. Refiners reported potential penalties in gasoline and diesel production if lighter crude was used in units designed for heavy crudes. The impact of the sale on oil prices was uncertain. The sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR may lead to refiners shutting down units. The effect on prices is uncertain as oil companies may have limited interest in SPR oil unless they can refine it or build crude oil stocks. Bids on SPR oil must be fair to the U.S. government. A unilateral draw on U.S. stocks may have less impact on the world oil market than a coordinated international drawdown. The sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR may lead to refiners shutting down units. A unilateral draw on U.S. stocks will probably have less impact on the world oil market than a coordinated international drawdown. It is possible that producing nations might reduce production to offset any SPR oil delivered into the market. The SPR has been perceived as a defensive policy tool against high oil prices, but if it is used without a discernible impact on oil prices, it may lose some of its psychological leverage. During the winter of 1999-2000, home heating oil prices doubled in some Northeastern areas, leading to interest in establishing a regional reserve. Congress authorized and funded the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) with $8 million in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act. The NHOR, located in New Haven, CT, Woodbridge, NJ, and Providence, RI, aims to provide around 10 days of Northeast home heating oil demand. Controversy arose over the reserve's potential use. Opponents of establishing a regional reserve suspected that it might be tapped at inappropriate times, potentially disincentivizing the private sector from maintaining inventories. The threshold for using the reserve was set high to avoid discouraging oil marketers and distributors from stockbuilding. The President could authorize a release of the NHOR in the event of a regional supply shortage or other circumstances. In December 2000, the 60% price differential was breached due to a decline in crude prices, not a rise in home heating oil prices. In late 2000, the 60% price differential was breached due to a decline in crude prices, not a rise in home heating oil prices. A general strike in Venezuela in late 2002 led to a loss of daily crude supply to the US, causing a reliance on refined product inventories for home heating oil during a cold winter. Despite calls for using the NHOR, the price of heating oil did not meet the guidelines for a drawdown. Congress requested DOE to advise on the circumstances for NHOR use in FY2004 appropriations. The FY2004 appropriations committee requested DOE to advise on the circumstances for NHOR use. The President can invoke NHOR drawdown authorities even if price threshold is not met. S. 283 introduced in 2009 would permit drawdown based on price and supply, releasing 20% of heating oil if average retail price exceeds $4.00/gallon on November 1."
