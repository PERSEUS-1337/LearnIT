    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress acknowledges the lack of a health care program for pre-1956 retired uniformed service members and the misleading information provided to service members regarding fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. After multiple base closures and reductions in military medical facilities, access to healthcare for many military retirees is challenging. While TRICARE coverage was extended to medicare-eligible retirees over 65, those under 65 were not addressed. The US should fulfill promises made to provide high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM. Coverage for Retirees and Dependents under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is provided through an agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management. Eligible beneficiaries include members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, and dependents of deceased members. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members, can enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan for self-only or self and family coverage. They are not required to meet eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5, except as provided in specific cases. Eligible beneficiaries can enroll in Federal Employees Health Benefits plans without meeting specific eligibility criteria. They may receive health care in a military facility and be reimbursed by the program. Eligible beneficiaries enrolled in Federal Employees Health Benefits plans can change plans and coverage like other beneficiaries. Government contributions are limited to the amount payable for an employee in the same plan. Separate risk pools are required for premium rate establishment. Reimbursement is provided for health care expenses normally covered by TRICARE Standard. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5 for health care costs not covered by the plan but would have been paid by the Department of Defense under TRICARE Standard. SEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS AT TRICARE NETWORK PHARMACY LEVELS TO CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES AND DEPENDENTS IN HARDSHIP CASES. Effective Date: October 1, 2010. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician that they lack access due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals must have another insurance plan providing primary health coverage."
