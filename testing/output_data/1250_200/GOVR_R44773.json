    "content": "The process of appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is outlined in the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The President nominates a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appointment. The most recent nomination was Merrick B. Garland by President Obama in 2016 to replace Justice Scalia. Majority Leader McConnell argued that the American people should have a say in the selection of the next Justice. Following Justice Scalia's death, Senator McConnell argued that the American people should have a say in selecting the next Supreme Court Justice, advocating for the vacancy to remain unfilled until a new President is elected. Senator Grassley echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to defer to the American people. In contrast, Senator Reid urged for the Senate to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, stating that failing to fill the vacancy would be a neglect of their Constitutional duty. President Obama called for a fair hearing and vote on Garland's nomination, highlighting the Senate's responsibility in the process. Despite these calls, Garland's nomination was not acted upon by the Senate. The Garland nomination for the Supreme Court was not acted upon by the Senate and was ultimately returned to President Obama. President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy. The report analyzes the frequency of Supreme Court vacancies, the length of the Scalia vacancy, and the pending Gorsuch nomination before the Senate. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies on the Court have occurred on average every two years. In the post-War period (1946 to present), vacancies have occurred every 2.4 years, and since 1980, slightly less frequently at every 3.1 years. The length of time between the vacancies created by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period between two vacancies on the Court. The retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period of time between two vacancies on the Supreme Court, lasting 2,054 days or 5.6 years. Justices on the Court typically hold office for life, leading to instances where they serve until death. Out of 111 vacancies in the past 225 years, 42% have occurred due to a sitting Justice's death, while 58% have arisen from other reasons like retirement or elevation to a new judgeship. Since 1791, 64 vacancies on the Supreme Court have occurred for reasons other than a Justice's death, such as new judgeships or retirements. In the past 60 years, only 8% of vacancies were due to a Justice's death. Prior to 1900, 59% of vacancies arose from a Justice's death, while from 1900 to 1955, 43% of vacancies were due to deaths. Since 1791, 59% of vacancies on the Supreme Court arose from a Justice's death, with an average vacancy lasting 121 days. Vacancies have varied in length, ranging from 1 day to 835 days. Before 1900, vacancies lasted an average of 165 days, while since 1900, vacancies have lasted an average of 77 days. Since 1900, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted an average of 77 days, with the Scalia vacancy currently at 382 days, making it the seventh longest in history. The vacancy created in 1969 by the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas lasted 363 days. The average length of time from nomination to final Senate action for the Court since 1791 has been 28 days.

Scalia's vacancy is currently the seventh longest in history at 382 days. The Garland nomination for the Supreme Court vacancy lasted 293 days before Senate action. Judge Gorsuch's nomination has been pending for 28 days. Six out of 10 nominations were not approved by the Senate. The longest-pending confirmed nomination was Louis Brandeis in 1916. Some vacancies had multiple nominations, leading to longer wait times. Vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years are relatively uncommon. Out of 111 vacancies, 16 have occurred during a presidential election year. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies, including the Scalia vacancy, that arose during a presidential election year before the general election and had a nomination submitted by the President. The Scalia vacancy is the first on the Court during a presidential election year where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President nominated someone before the election. Out of 9 vacancies since 1791 under these circumstances, the Senate did not approve nominees for 3 vacancies, including the Scalia vacancy. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice in anticipation of vacancies. However, the Senate failed to confirm the nominations, and Chief Justice Warren did not step down until 1969, resulting in no vacancies on the Court in 1968. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court that arose during one presidency and were filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies filled on the Court since 1791. The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1881 when President Garfield was assassinated and the vacancy created by Justice Nathan Clifford's death was eventually filled by President Arthur. Four of the seven vacancies were filled by a President belonging to a different political party than the President who left office. The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration with a change in party was in 1862. This occurred during the Second Party System and the Modern Party System. The Scalia vacancy had the longest period from vacancy to a new President taking office. During the Scalia vacancy, 342 days elapsed from the vacancy to when President Obama left office. Most departing Presidents submitted a nomination for the vacancy during their presidency. The number of days reported in Figure 5 does not represent the total days each vacancy existed before being filled. For example, the Baldwin vacancy lasted 835 days, but only 317 days from when it occurred to the end of the Tyler presidency. Similarly, the Scalia vacancy lasted 342 days from occurrence to the end of the Obama presidency. The Scalia vacancy lasted 342 days from occurrence to the end of the Obama presidency. Sometimes, multiple nominations are made before a vacancy on the Supreme Court is filled. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies that required more than one nomination before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example of this. The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court lasted 342 days from occurrence to the end of the Obama presidency. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies that required multiple nominations before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example of this, with 12 vacancies since 1860 requiring multiple nominations before a new Justice was appointed. Vacancies on the Supreme Court that require multiple nominations before being filled have generally lasted longer than the median length of a vacancy on the Court. Eight out of 11 vacancies lasted longer than 61 days, with 7 lasting at least 100 days. Additionally, 6 vacancies lasted longer than the average length of a vacancy on the court. Nominees eventually approved by the Senate received unanimous or nearly unanimous support at the time of confirmation. Samuel Alito's nomination in 2006 received 42 nay votes, while other nominees approved by the Senate received unanimous or nearly unanimous support."
