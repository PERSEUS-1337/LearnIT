    "content": "The \"Polar Bear Seas Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to the protection of polar bear habitats. Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which support a variety of endangered species and are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures. Scientists agree that climate change is significantly impacting Arctic sea ice habitats for polar bears, walrus, and seals. In January 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species due to the projected loss of sea ice from global warming. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on providing protections to the polar bear in 2008. Despite this, they moved forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea, a polar bear habitat. The United States District Court ruled that the Department of the Interior must decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. The United States Geological Survey projected a significant decline in the polar bear population due to future sea ice changes. Oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas pose additional risks to polar bears and marine life. Oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses significant risks to polar bears and other marine life due to the lack of effective oil spill recovery methods in the harsh Arctic environment. The leasing plans for these areas overlap with vital polar bear habitat, increasing the potential for negative impacts on the population. Oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses significant risks to polar bears and other marine life, with potential impacts on whales, walruses, and denning polar bears. Tribal governments have expressed opposition due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas due to risks to marine life and opposition from tribal governments. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of baseline information and potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It also mentions the adequacy of environmental studies and the submission of a report to Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for submitting a report to Congress regarding missing information, ongoing studies, and recommendations for additional research related to the Endangered Species Act and polar bear listings. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations, setting a standard for oil recovery within 30 days, and achieving an 85 percent recovery standard before issuing leases. The Secretary's oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations includes achieving an 85 percent oil recovery standard before issuing leases, implementing procedures to close areas to oil and gas activity, and establishing requirements for oil spill prevention systems. The Secretary must ensure all recommendations from the National Research Council report are implemented, oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas do not harm wildlife, and mitigation measures are in place to avoid risks. The response gap analysis defines a period where the oil spill recovery standard cannot be met. The response gap analysis calculates spill response system limits for environmental factors and assesses conditions that could hinder a response. The response gap analysis evaluates limiting factors that may prevent achieving the oil spill recovery standard, quantifying the percentage of time when local conditions exceed spill response system limits."
