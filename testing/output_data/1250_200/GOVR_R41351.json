    "content": "Housing counseling organizations provide information on housing issues to various populations, such as prospective homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and the homeless. The federal government supports private housing counseling agencies through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by certifying agencies that meet criteria and providing funding through competitive grants. HUD-approved agencies listed on their website can apply for these grants, but not all certified agencies are guaranteed to receive funding. HUD's housing counseling grants do not cover agencies' full costs, and funding fluctuates yearly. Congress has provided additional funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling through NeighborWorks America since FY2008. The federal government supports housing counseling through various programs, including HUD's housing counseling program, NeighborWorks, and support from agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Defense. While housing counseling is voluntary, some programs require it. However, funding for housing counseling agencies may not always increase despite increased demand due to these requirements. This report provides an overview of federal support for housing counseling, including eligibility criteria for funding and distribution of funds. It also discusses the relationship between housing counseling and financial literacy counseling, aimed at promoting sound financial decisions. Housing counseling is intended to help individuals and families set budgets, manage finances, and understand complex financial concepts to make sound decisions. It can be provided alongside financial counseling, with some overlap between the two. Financial literacy counseling may include information on housing and homeownership, but housing counseling focuses specifically on housing-related decisions. Some organizations offer both types of counseling, while others focus on one. Housing counseling encompasses a variety of activities for different populations with distinct housing goals. Housing counseling covers a wide range of activities for various populations with different housing goals, such as buying a home, renting, or seeking reverse mortgages. It is divided into pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling, addressing topics like financial literacy, homeownership responsibilities, maintenance, budgeting, and mortgage delinquency. The specific issues covered in housing counseling depend on the individual's needs. Housing counseling covers a wide range of topics for various populations, including renters, Section 8 voucher holders, the homeless, and senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. Counseling can help with HUD housing programs, fair housing laws, mobility, and accessing needed services. The provision of counseling can vary in terms of setting and methods. Housing counseling can be provided in various ways, including individual or group sessions, in person, over the phone, or through self-study. The length of counseling can vary from one session to several spread out over weeks or months. HUD generally prefers face-to-face counseling but allows for other forms in certain situations. HUD allows for various forms of housing counseling, including face-to-face, phone, or group sessions. Face-to-face counseling may not be feasible in some situations, such as for those in remote areas or facing foreclosure. Counseling can help households make informed housing decisions and avoid default or foreclosure. Housing counseling for homebuyers is believed to provide benefits to both buyers and lenders by preparing buyers for homeownership, reducing default rates, and helping manage circumstances that could lead to default. Critics note limited research on outcomes and question the effectiveness of housing counseling. Critics question the effectiveness of housing counseling due to limited research on outcomes and uncertainty about its benefits. Pre-purchase counseling may be limited in its impact as it often occurs after a borrower has already chosen a home and mortgage. Housing counseling is voluntary for most populations, but some programs require it as a condition of participation. Some federal programs, like HECM and USDA's Section 502 direct loan program, mandate housing counseling for eligibility. HUD's Homeownership Voucher Program also requires counseling for participation. Additionally, HAMP participants must undergo housing counseling. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) requires housing counseling for certain participants with high debt-to-income ratios. Homebuyers using funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) must also participate in counseling. Federal Home Loan Banks allocate 10% of their net income to the Affordable Housing Program (AHP). The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) allocate 10% of their net income to the Affordable Housing Program (AHP), which includes a competitive grant program and a voluntary homeownership set-aside program. Housing counseling is required for first-time homebuyers assisted through the AHP. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also mandate counseling for certain borrowers using specific affordable mortgage products. Many state housing finance agencies offer low-cost mortgage programs for low- or moderate-income households, encouraging housing counseling for participants. FHA does not generally require counseling but can charge lower insurance premiums for borrowers who receive counseling. The Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to require counseling for high-cost mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Truth in Lending Act to require pre-purchase housing counseling for borrowers receiving high-cost mortgages defined by TILA. HUD-approved agencies primarily serve prospective homebuyers and homeowners, with a small portion counseling renters and the homeless. In FY2011, less than a fifth of counseling activities by HUD-approved agencies were for rental or homelessness counseling, with rental counseling at 15% and counseling for the homeless at 2%. Housing counseling is provided by various organizations, including for-profit and nonprofit ones, but only nonprofit organizations can be certified by HUD for grants. Agencies vary in size and mission, with some specializing in housing counseling while others have broader missions. The National Council of La Raza, Catholic Charities USA, and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers are HUD-approved housing counseling intermediaries with broader missions. Some agencies specialize in specific types of housing counseling, while others offer comprehensive counseling on various housing issues. HUD-approved agencies must be nonprofit organizations, unlike for-profit organizations that also provide housing counseling services. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies may offer different types of counseling services compared to non-approved agencies. HUD encourages face-to-face counseling, leading approved agencies to provide more individualized in-person counseling. Non-approved agencies may offer more telephone counseling, group education classes, or self-study programs. While HUD has requirements for housing counseling, there are no standardized curricula or training requirements. NeighborWorks America promotes standardized requirements through its NeighborWorks Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling. NeighborWorks America promotes standardized requirements for housing counseling through its NeighborWorks Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling. Studies on the effectiveness of housing counseling have been limited in scope, with early research showing some positive outcomes such as reduced default rates. However, the studies had varying focuses and definitions of success, making it difficult to generalize the results. Since the early 1980s, there have been limited empirical studies on housing counseling effectiveness until the mid- to late 1990s. A new wave of studies has been conducted to examine whether housing counseling achieves desired outcomes. One study by Abdighani Hirad and Peter M. Zorn in 2001 found that pre-purchase housing counseling reduced the likelihood of mortgage delinquency, with face-to-face counseling being more effective. Studies have shown that face-to-face housing counseling is more effective in reducing delinquency rates compared to phone or self-study counseling. Research on pre- and post-purchase education and counseling over the last 15 years suggests positive effects, but attributing these effects solely to counseling is challenging due to the lack of randomized experiments and data tracking. Housing counseling lacks data tracking and standardized methods, making it difficult to evaluate effectiveness. While some evidence suggests positive outcomes, more empirical research is needed to determine its impact on housing outcomes. The federal government primarily supports housing counseling through HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program, which certifies agencies meeting specific criteria and provides grants. The legislative authority for this program is found at 12 U.S.C. Section 1701x, established in 1968. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 amended the Act of 1968 to include counseling for low- and moderate-income families assisted through federal housing programs. This counseling could be provided directly by HUD or through contracts with other organizations. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 expanded HUD's authority to provide housing counseling for renters and homeowners, allowing for monetary grants to counseling agencies. This Act also allowed HUD to directly provide counseling services or contract with other organizations. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 expanded HUD's authority to provide housing counseling through monetary grants to agencies. While HUD can provide counseling directly, it has chosen to support outside organizations. Congress began regularly funding HUD for housing counseling in FY1977, with grants awarded to HUD-approved agencies. HUD has competitively awarded housing counseling grants to HUD-approved agencies, including local housing counseling agencies, multi-state organizations, regional intermediaries, and national intermediaries. These agencies must be certified by HUD or be a state housing finance agency to be eligible for grants. Local housing counseling agencies provide services within limited geographic areas, while multi-state organizations operate in two or more states. Agencies must apply directly to HUD to receive counseling funds. Regional and national intermediaries are agencies that provide housing counseling services through a network of branches and affiliates covering a broader geographic area. They offer administrative and financial support to their branches and affiliates, who directly provide housing counseling to individuals. Intermediaries apply for HUD funding and pass it on to their affiliates. SHFAs, LCHAs, MSOs, and intermediaries can apply for HUD housing counseling funding. SHFAs are state-chartered authorities that administer housing programs. Certified HUD counseling agencies can apply for funding and must meet basic requirements for approval. To be certified by HUD, housing counseling organizations must be nonprofit organizations with at least one year of experience in the geographic area they plan to serve. They must have adequate resources, including funding and trained staff, and appropriate facilities. The agency must have at least six months of relevant experience, appropriate facilities, familiarity with housing programs, relationships with community resources, reporting and monitoring systems, and must not have any conduct issues. They must also provide direct housing counseling services. The agency must have relevant experience, appropriate facilities, relationships with community resources, and must not have any conduct issues to undertake a counseling program. Direct provision of counseling is required, and the agency must meet all state and local requirements. The application process for HUD approval varies for different types of agencies. If approved, the agency becomes a HUD-approved housing counseling organization. If a housing counseling agency meets all required criteria and its final application is approved by HUD, it becomes a HUD-approved housing counseling organization for up to three years. HUD-approved agencies are subject to periodic performance reviews and may be reapproved, placed on inactive status, or terminated. Branch offices and affiliates do not need separate approval but must meet criteria. State housing finance agencies do not need HUD approval. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies must provide individualized, face-to-face counseling to clients, with the option for telephone counseling. They are also required to offer group educational sessions and refer clients to other agencies if they cannot provide specific services. Counseling may be charged under certain circumstances, but must be provided free of charge in general. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies may charge fees for counseling under certain circumstances but must provide free counseling for clients unable to pay. Agencies cannot charge fees for services already funded by HUD grants. They must disclose any fees from lenders to clients and submit a housing counseling work plan to HUD. Each agency must counsel a minimum of 30 clients per year, except those offering only reverse mortgage counseling. Congress has regularly funded HUD for housing counseling since FY1977, except for FY2011. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program has fluctuated over the years, with appropriations generally staying flat in the 1980s, trending upward in the 1990s, and rising sharply in FY2003. After remaining flat for a few years, funding began to increase again in FY2008, peaking in FY2011 when Congress did not provide any funding. However, funding was reinstated in FY2012 at a lower amount. Policymakers' interest in housing counseling has varied based on housing program results, policy goals, and market conditions. Interest in housing counseling increased in the 1990s due to national housing policy goals focusing on increasing homeownership rates, especially among low-income and minority groups. New requirements encouraged mortgage lending to underserved populations, leading to greater interest in counseling to identify sustainable homeowners and help those facing foreclosure. Congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose as a result of this trend. Congressional appropriations for housing counseling increased significantly in the mid- to late 1990s and again in FY2003, FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 in response to the rising demand for housing counseling and the need to support homeownership initiatives. The increase in funding was likely a response to the surge in foreclosures starting in 2006, with policymakers allocating more funds for delinquency and default counseling to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Policymakers may appropriate more funding for delinquency and default counseling to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Concerns have been raised about the delay in distributing housing counseling funds by HUD. Critics argue that funding for HUD's housing counseling program duplicates funding provided to NeighborWorks America for foreclosure mitigation counseling. HUD's housing counseling program received $45 million in FY2012, the lowest funding level since FY2007. The President's budget for FY2013 requests $55 million for housing counseling. Agencies must be HUD-certified to be eligible for grants. HUD-certified housing counseling agencies are eligible for competitive grants from HUD, but not all certified agencies receive funding. HUD announces grant opportunities annually through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). Grants are awarded competitively for specific counseling categories, with maximum amounts set by HUD. LHCAs and MSOs apply directly for grants and use the funding for housing counseling programs. Intermediaries receiving grants pass on funding to their branches or affiliates. HUD-approved intermediaries can pass on housing counseling funds to their branches or affiliates without the need for separate approval from HUD. Branches or affiliates may also be HUD-certified as LHCAs or MSOs and can apply for funding directly or through the intermediary. Agencies may choose to receive funding as a branch or affiliate for various reasons, such as easier application processes or potentially receiving more funding. HUD-approved intermediaries can distribute housing counseling funds to their branches or affiliates without separate approval from HUD. Agencies applying for HUD housing counseling funds are evaluated based on criteria outlined in HUD's NOFA, including capacity, geographic need, program quality, resource leverage, and results. Points are awarded for each criterion, with only agencies meeting a minimum threshold eligible for funding. Grant amounts are based on points awarded, with funding trends varying for different agency types. In recent years, HUD funding for housing counseling agencies has fluctuated, with changes in grant sizes and types of counseling funded. The number of grants awarded may differ from the number of organizations receiving grants. In FY2012, HUD awarded nearly 540 housing counseling grants, a decrease from FY2010. In FY2012, HUD awarded around 540 housing counseling grants to local housing counseling agencies, intermediaries, and state housing finance agencies. This was a decrease from the approximately 650 grants awarded in FY2010. The majority of grants were given to local housing counseling agencies, with about 480 grants awarded to them, while intermediaries received almost 40 grants, and state housing finance agencies received 15 grants. The number of distinct organizations receiving HUD housing counseling funding remained fairly steady between FY2004 and FY2008. The number of distinct housing counseling agencies receiving HUD funding remained steady between FY2004 and FY2008, ranging from about 360 to 420 organizations. In FY2009, the number rose to nearly 500, and in FY2010 it increased to nearly 515 before dropping to about 470 in FY2012. Intermediaries receive a larger total amount of funding from HUD compared to local housing counseling agencies, with SHFAs receiving the least amount each year. In FY2012, intermediaries received almost $28 million, LHCAs received almost $12 million, and SHFAs received about $2.5 million. The average grant size for an intermediary was about $700,000, for an LHCA was about $24,000, and for an SHFA was about $168,000. The average grant size for comprehensive counseling fluctuated between $77,000 in FY2012 and over $107,000 in FY2008. Funding for comprehensive counseling increased as appropriations to the housing counseling program rose, reaching nearly $54 million in FY2010 before falling to about $36 million in FY2012. The number of grants for comprehensive counseling also increased, from about 360 grants in FY2004 to nearly 510 grants in FY2010, before dropping to almost 470 grants in FY2012. The average grant size for comprehensive counseling fluctuated between $77,000 in FY2012 and over $107,000 in FY2008. Funding for comprehensive counseling increased as appropriations to the housing counseling program rose, reaching nearly $54 million in FY2010 before falling to about $36 million in FY2012. The amount of funding that HUD awarded for specialized types of counseling has varied in recent years, ranging from a low of $3 million in FY2006 to a high of nearly $19 million in FY2010. In recent years, HUD awarded funding for various types of counseling, including homeownership voucher counseling, predatory lending counseling, counseling in the colonias, HECM counseling, housing counseling training, loan document review counseling, Mortgage Modification and Mortgage Scams Assistance (MMSA) counseling. The majority of housing counseling activities focused on homeownership counseling. Funding for specialized counseling fluctuated, with grants ranging from $3 million in FY2006 to nearly $19 million in FY2010. In recent years, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies primarily focused on homeownership counseling, including pre-purchase, mortgage delinquency, and post-purchase counseling. In FY2010, over 80% of counseling activities were related to homeownership, with mortgage delinquency counseling accounting for about 65% of total counseling activities. In FY2011, counseling activities at HUD-approved agencies included pre-purchase, rental, post-purchase, and homelessness counseling. Mortgage delinquency counseling accounted for about 56% of total activities, while the total number of counseling units provided decreased to 1.4 million from 2.2 million in FY2010. The federal government provides financial support for housing counseling through appropriations to HUD's housing counseling program and other sources, including NeighborWorks America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Defense. NeighborWorks has played a larger role in housing counseling by administering federal funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling. Housing counseling is also an eligible use of funds from HUD's Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The CDBG and HOME programs provide funding for housing counseling in certain situations. States and localities allocate these funds based on a formula and can choose to use them for affordable housing activities. HOME funds can be used for a wide range of housing counseling activities, while CDBG funds can be used for community development activities, including housing counseling. NeighborWorks America administers federal funding for housing counseling, including foreclosure mitigation counseling. NeighborWorks America, established in 1978, is a nonprofit corporation with a national network of over 235 organizations engaged in community revitalization activities. To become a NeighborWorks affiliate, organizations must meet specific criteria and undergo a detailed inspection process that can take up to two years. NeighborWorks affiliates must undergo a detailed on-site inspection as part of the process to become a chartered member, which can take up to two years. Affiliation with NeighborWorks is necessary to be eligible for funding and technical assistance. NeighborWorks receives regular congressional appropriations to provide grants, training, and technical assistance to its affiliates, who engage in various community activities, including housing counseling. While some funding is allocated for housing counseling, none is specifically dedicated to it. NeighborWorks receives regular congressional appropriations for grants, training, and technical assistance for its affiliates, who engage in various community activities, including housing counseling. While some funding is allocated for housing counseling, none is specifically dedicated to it. Additionally, NeighborWorks administers funding specifically for foreclosure mitigation counseling as directed by Congress. NeighborWorks administers funding specifically for foreclosure mitigation counseling as directed by Congress through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). This funding is separate from regular appropriations and is distributed competitively to HUD-approved counseling intermediaries, state housing finance agencies, or NeighborWorks affiliates. Congress first provided $180 million for the NFMCP in 2008, with additional funding allocated in subsequent years. In FY2012, Congress increased funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) significantly. NeighborWorks distributed NFMCP funding to over 170 organizations, providing counseling to nearly 1.2 million homeowners. States like California, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois received the most assistance through NFMCP. The Department of Veterans Affairs also offers loan counselors to help veterans facing foreclosure or financial issues, regardless of VA mortgage guarantees. The VA provides loan counselors to assist veterans facing foreclosure or financial issues, regardless of VA mortgage guarantees. The VA recommends pre-purchase counseling with HUD-approved housing counselors for veterans pursuing VA-guaranteed loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a program for financial literacy counseling focused on housing decisions for prospective homebuyers. Organizations receiving grants must be HUD-approved. The Financial Education and Counseling pilot program, funded by Congress, aims to help prospective homebuyers make better financial decisions. Organizations must be HUD-approved or approved by Treasury's Office of Financial Education to receive grants. The program is administered by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, with funding awarded to agencies in FY2009 and FY2010. Congress provided $4.15 million for the Financial Education and Counseling pilot program, with $3.15 million designated for an organization in Hawaii. Funding recipients were announced in October 2010, but no funding was provided in FY2011 or FY2012. P.L. 110-289 also directed the Department of Defense to establish a foreclosure counseling program for servicemembers returning from active duty. HUD was directed to conduct a demonstration program on pre-purchase counseling effectiveness for first-time homebuyers with FHA-insured loans. The demonstration was to end on July 30, 2011. HUD contracted with Abt Associates to carry out a pre-purchase counseling study involving 4,000 first-time homebuyers with FHA-insured loans. The study is set to begin enrolling participants in 2012. Securing funding is a challenge for housing counseling agencies, as they are not guaranteed HUD grants. According to a 2008 report by Abt Associates, HUD funding accounted for only 13.5% of agencies' total funding. The 2007 Abt report found that HUD funding accounted for 13.5% of agencies' total funding. Housing counseling agencies also receive funding from other sources such as federal programs, state and local governments, financial institutions, foundations, and public housing authorities. The wide variety of funding sources is illustrated in Figure 5 of the report. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies receive funding from various sources, including federal programs like the HOME program and CDBG. Federal sources account for about 37.5% of agencies' funding, with fees from clients making up a small portion. Prior to 2007, agencies were not allowed to charge fees for counseling, but this changed with the Housing Counseling Program Final Rule. The Housing Counseling Program Final Rule in 2007 allowed HUD-approved agencies to charge reasonable fees for counseling services, as long as it doesn't create a financial burden for clients. Agencies can also receive fees from lenders with disclosure to clients, addressing issues of standardization in the industry. HUD certifies agencies but not individual counselors, leading to a lack of agreement on counselor standards. The lack of standardization in housing counseling agencies raises concerns about the quality of advice given, potential conflicts of interest, and the possibility of fraud. There is no consensus on the standards individual counselors should meet for certification, nor is there a standard curriculum for counseling sessions. Standardizing training and approval processes for both organizations and counselors could help address these issues and ensure that clients' best interests are prioritized. Standardizing training and approval processes for housing counseling agencies and counselors can strengthen the industry and deter potential problems. Efforts to develop industry-wide standards have been driven by various stakeholders, including Fannie Mae's American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) in 1996. AHECI aimed to establish national accreditation standards, develop a core curriculum, research costs and benefits, and create self-financing mechanisms for housing counseling. The American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) aimed to standardize training and accreditation for housing counseling agencies. Despite progress, AHECI no longer exists. NeighborWorks's Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling (NCHEC) has taken over some of AHECI's goals, such as establishing standards for housing counseling curricula. The National Association of Housing Counselors and Agencies (NAHCA) provides training and certification for housing counselors. The American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) aimed to standardize training and accreditation for housing counseling agencies. NeighborWorks's Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling (NCHEC) has taken over some of AHECI's goals, such as establishing standards for housing counseling curricula. The National Association of Housing Counselors and Agencies (NAHCA) provides training, testing, certification, and technical assistance to housing counselors and counseling agencies nationwide. HUD published a Final Rule specifying requirements for counselors who provide HECM counseling, including the establishment of a HECM Counselor Roster. To be eligible for the roster, counselors must meet specific criteria and have access to technology for tracking counseling results. The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act) was passed as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 requires states to establish licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators. Responsibility for the Act was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011. HUD issued a Final Rule in 2011 implementing minimum standards for licensing and registration of mortgage originators. Some housing counseling agencies expressed concerns about the interpretation of the rule regarding licensing requirements for housing counselors involved in pre-purchase or foreclosure mitigation counseling under the SAFE Act. HUD clarified that the rule applies to anyone engaged in loan origination activities, but traditional housing counseling activities may not fall under this definition. The Final Rule exempted certain individuals from complying with the SAFE Act, such as employees of state housing finance agencies and nonprofit organizations. The CFPB published an interim final rule in December 2011, implementing the provisions of the SAFE Act. This rule clarified licensing requirements for housing counselors engaged in loan origination activities. Since 2006, housing counseling agencies like NeighborWorks and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation have focused on reducing mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. NeighborWorks established a Center for Foreclosure Solutions offering training and research, while the Homeownership Preservation Foundation set up a hotline (888-995-HOPE) to aid homeowners facing foreclosure. The hotline number 888-995-HOPE assists homeowners facing foreclosure and connects them with counselors for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Counseling is required for certain HAMP participants with high debt-to-income ratios, leading to increased demand for housing counseling services. Funding for foreclosure mitigation housing counseling primarily comes from NeighborWorks America. NeighborWorks America provides funding for foreclosure mitigation housing counseling, including counseling for HAMP participants with high debt-to-income ratios. Between 240,000 and 320,000 HAMP participants were expected to be referred to counseling, but fewer referrals have been occurring. Over 7,000 borrowers in HAMP trial modifications received counseling through NeighborWorks' program by June 30, 2011. The lower-than-expected number of HAMP borrowers receiving counseling may be due to servicers not consistently referring borrowers or borrowers not pursuing counseling despite the requirement. The number of HAMP borrowers receiving counseling through the NFMCP may not be as high as expected due to servicers not consistently referring borrowers or borrowers not pursuing counseling despite the requirement. The average total debt-to-income ratio of participants in the program remains high even after a mortgage modification. Securing funding is a challenge for housing counseling agencies, despite increased funding from Congress in recent years. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program has been inconsistent, which may strain agencies providing counseling to borrowers facing default or foreclosure. The Dodd-Frank Act established an Office of Housing Counseling within HUD to oversee homeownership and rental housing counseling activities. The Secretary of HUD is directed to expand housing counseling, set standards, and provide outreach to the public, including certifying software programs for evaluating mortgage products. Funding for housing counseling agencies remains a challenge despite increased support from Congress. The Secretary of HUD is directed to provide advice, technical assistance, and financial aid to housing counseling agencies and SHFAs. They are also tasked with informing consumers about home inspection counseling and developing related materials. The Director of the Office of Housing Counseling has specific functions, including establishing rules and collaborating with community-based organizations. The Dodd-Frank legislation mandates rules for housing counseling, collaboration with community organizations, and public awareness campaigns. Only HUD-approved agencies can provide counseling for HUD programs. Amendments to the HOEPA prohibit high-cost mortgages without counseling from a HUD-approved counselor."
