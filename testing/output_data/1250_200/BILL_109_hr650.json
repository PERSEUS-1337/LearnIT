Vaccines are available for various diseases, reducing medical costs and benefiting the community. However, the threat of litigation and high manufacturing costs have led to a decrease in vaccine production by manufacturers. In the 1980s, a litigation crisis led to a decrease in the number of companies producing vaccines in the United States. Currently, only 4 companies manufacture the majority of vaccines, resulting in limited access to these life-saving products. To address the issue of costly liability lawsuits affecting vaccine production, the Congress established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program allows individuals to file claims for vaccine-related injuries, with over $1.5 billion paid out in compensation. Despite this program, vaccine companies still face costly litigation exposure. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program allows individuals to opt out and pursue lawsuits in State and Federal courts. Trial attorneys often bypass the Program by alleging vaccines are not covered or that certain components are excluded. The Program does not prevent ineligible individuals from pursuing civil litigation to ensure valid scientific evidence is used in vaccine-related litigation. To streamline vaccine-related litigation, all cases outside the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should be heard in US district courts following Supreme Court guidelines. Additionally, a joint study by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, should aim to expedite compensation for legitimate claims within the Program. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines will submit a report to Congress within one year with recommendations. The purposes of the Act are to establish legal reforms for vaccine manufacture, ensure litigation is based on valid scientific evidence, discourage frivolous lawsuits, and compensate injured patients fairly and promptly. The Federal Court Remedy is established under Section 3 of the Act to provide a legal avenue for vaccine-related litigation. Section 2122 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C 300aa-22) is amended to create a Federal cause of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths occurring after October 1, 1988. This cause of action is the exclusive remedy for such injuries, with jurisdiction specified. The district courts of the United States have original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions for damages arising from vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988. Any civil action in a State court can be removed to the district court before final judgment. The removal of any State causes of action for damages or equitable relief related to vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988 is preempted. The term 'vaccine' includes any component of a vaccine. SEC. 4. Sanctions for frivolous vaccine litigation; 3-strikes rule for suspending attorneys who commit multiple Rule 11 violations. SEC. 4 introduces sanctions for attorneys who violate Rule 11 in vaccine-related injury cases. Attorneys with 3 or more violations may be suspended from practicing law in the district court for 1 year, with the possibility of additional suspension. Appeals can be made with a stay on the suspension, and reinstatement requires completion of the suspension period. To be reinstated to practice law in a district court of the United States after a suspension, the attorney must petition the court for reinstatement under prescribed procedures and conditions. SEC. 5. TRIAL PROCEDURE. Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection (b) on causation in fact for vaccine-related injuries or deaths. If the evidence shows the injury or death was caused by the vaccine, a second stage of the civil action will proceed. Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection (b) on causation in fact for vaccine-related injuries or deaths. The amendment involves changing references from \"second\" to \"third\" and then to \"fourth\" in subsections (d) and (e). Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 2122(b)(2) by replacing \"2123(d)(2)\" with \"2123(e)(2)\". SEC. 6. TRANSITION RULES. If a State law claim for damages or relief related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff can elect to treat it as a Federal law claim under the Public Health Service Act within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. Failure to file this notice within the specified period will result in dismissal of the claim. If a State law claim for damages related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff or defendant can remove the action to the district court of the United States by filing a notice of removal within 30 days. The notice must be signed according to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and include a brief statement of the grounds for removal, along with all relevant documents. The State court must halt proceedings upon receiving the notice, and any remand order is appealable. The removal process follows sections 1446 through 1451 of title 28, United States Code. If a case is not properly removed within 40 days of the enactment of this Act, any claim subject to subsection (a) that remains pending in State court or that is remanded to State court shall be promptly dismissed with prejudice. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT. The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault system to handle claims quickly and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports suggest delays, increased adversarial process, and a shift towards full-blown litigation, contrary to Congress' intent. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was intended as a positive alternative to tort litigation. A report with recommendations to ensure injured patients are compensated in a less adversarial manner is to be submitted to Congress within a year."
