    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act of 1999\". The purpose of the Act is to address findings related to airport pollution. Congress finds that the serious pollution problems associated with airport operations, including ground level ozone, noise, water pollution, and solid waste disposal, require a comprehensive evaluation of significant pollution sources. This evaluation is mandated by various environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The Airport Pollution Control Act establishes standards for drinking water and a groundwater control program. It addresses air pollution from airports through the airport bubble concept, treating airports as single sources of pollution emitting various pollutants. The purpose is to reduce pollution within the airport bubble area. The Airport Pollution Control Act aims to reduce pollution in and around airports by conducting feasibility studies on applying airport bubbles and assessing air pollutant emission standards for airplane engines. The Airport Pollution Control Act defines key terms like \"Administrator\" and \"airport bubble\" as areas around airports where pollution sources are identified and regulated. The Administrator will conduct a study on regulating pollution from all sources in and around airports using airport bubbles. A working group will be established, including representatives from various organizations and agencies. The study on regulating pollution around airports will involve representatives from various organizations such as air bases, bus lines, taxis, law enforcement, aviation associations, and environmental specialists. The Administrator will collect and analyze information on emissions testing, repair records, traffic conditions, and other relevant factors. The study on regulating pollution around airports will involve collecting and analyzing information on various sources of pollution within airport bubbles, including aircraft, vehicles, and equipment. It will consider relevant information from State implementation plans and airport master plans, assess air quality implications of airport operations, and evaluate the role of airports in interstate pollution. The study will assess the environmental and economic impact of regulating airports as sources of pollution, propose boundaries for airport bubbles, define air pollutant emissions, develop an inventory of pollution sources, evaluate reduction programs, and consider changes to laws and regulations. The study will evaluate regulating air, noise, water, and solid waste pollutants in and around airports using airport bubbles, address unique air and noise pollution issues at military air bases, and make recommendations for effective implementation. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. STUDY OF EMISSION STANDARDS FOR AIRPLANE ENGINES. The Administrator will study EPA emission standards for airplane engines to assess the need for stronger standards. A report must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. SEC. 6. PROGRESS REPORTS. The Administrator will provide progress reports to Congress annually until reports under sections 4 and 5 are submitted. SEC. 7. REPORTING OF TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASES. SEC. 7. REPORTING OF TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASES. The Administrator must require airports serving commercial or military jet aircraft to report toxic chemical releases and waste management activities within 180 days. This includes chemicals used in aircraft operation, maintenance, and other airport activities. Airports will be considered facilities for reporting purposes. SEC. 8. FUNDING. The Administrator will implement this Act using existing funds."
