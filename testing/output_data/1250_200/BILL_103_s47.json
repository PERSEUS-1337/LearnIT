The filing of a habeas corpus petition for relief in a capital case must be done within 180 days after a state court order is issued. Time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court or during post-conviction review in a state court. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition in a capital case can be extended under certain circumstances. The time can be tolled during post-conviction review in a state court if all State filing rules are met. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. Sec. 2259 outlines the procedures for evidentiary hearings and Federal review in habeas corpus cases for State prisoners under a capital sentence. The district court must assess the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts, unless certain exceptions apply. The district court must conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings to complete the record for habeas corpus review. Upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, the court will rule on the merits of the claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause for appeal does not apply to habeas corpus cases under this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
