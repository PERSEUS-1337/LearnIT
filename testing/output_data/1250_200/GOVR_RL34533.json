    "content": "Recent media reports suggest movement in negotiations on amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the 110th Congress. House and Senate committees have been active in oversight activities related to warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance programs. A National Intelligence Estimate highlighted the evolving threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need for modernizing FISA. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need for modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to respond to technological changes and meet current intelligence collection needs. He proposed two key changes: not requiring a court order for gathering foreign intelligence from overseas targets, and providing liability protection for those aiding in foreign intelligence collection efforts. The Protect America Act of 2007 was enacted into law with a 180-day sunset provision to address these concerns. On January 28, 2008, a cloture motion on an amendment to extend the sunset on the Protect America Act for 30 days fell short. Both the House and Senate passed a 15-day extension to allow further time to consider proposed legislation to amend FISA. The Protect America Act sunseted on February 16, 2008, with transitional provisions in effect. Bills were introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset period. The House and Senate passed bills to address electronic surveillance concerns. H.R. 3773, known as the RESTORE Act of 2007, was introduced and reported out of committees in October 2007. On November 15, 2007, the House took further action on the bill. The House and Senate passed bills related to electronic surveillance. H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007, was approved on October 17, 2007, and passed by the House on November 15, 2007. S. 2248, the FISA Amendment Act of 2007, was reported out of committees and underwent further proceedings in the Senate in late 2007. After passing bills related to electronic surveillance, Senate activities on S. 2248 resumed in January 2008. A modified version of the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment to S. 2248 was tabled on January 24, 2008. Several amendments were proposed and considered between January 24 and February 12, 2008. On February 12th, S.Amdt. 3911 to S. 2248 was agreed to and the bill was read for the third time. On February 12, 2008, S.Amdt. 3911 to S. 2248 was agreed to, and the Senate passed S. 2248, as amended, by a vote of 68-29. H.R. 3773 was then taken up, with the text of S. 2248 inserted in lieu thereof. The bill was passed, but the motion to reconsider was laid upon the table. The House Rules Committee reported H.Res. 1041 to the House on March 12, 2008, and the resolution passed two days later. The House agreed to a House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 by a vote of 213-197. The House and Senate have not yet gone to conference on FISA legislation. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve differences in the amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Senate amendment includes provisions for surveillance targeted outside the United States, while the House amendment does not have a similar provision. There are differences in how the bills treat the role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in procedures for gathering foreign intelligence information. The House amendment requires prior approval by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for acquisitions of communications of non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the United States. The FISC has 30 days to review and approve or deny such acquisitions. The Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence must adopt guidelines for compliance with limitations on acquisitions. The House bill requires FISC approval for acquisitions of non-U.S. persons' communications outside the U.S. Guidelines must be submitted to FISC and congressional committees. FISC can approve certification if requirements are met, otherwise, deficiencies must be corrected. In emergencies, AG and DNI can authorize acquisition temporarily. The Senate bill does not require FISC approval prior to acquisition of non-U.S. persons' communications abroad. Instead, certifications or procedures must be submitted to FISC within five days. Immediate action can be taken without prior certification in emergencies. The Senate bill requires the Attorney General and the DNI to prepare a certification within seven days if immediate action is needed for an acquisition. The FISC will approve continued use of procedures if they meet statutory requirements and constitutional standards. If deficiencies are found, the government must correct them within 30 days or cease the acquisition. The House bill does not require an application under section 104 of FISA for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States, while the Senate bill does not have similar language. Both bills allow for targeting of U.S. persons reasonably. The Senate bill and House bill differ in language regarding targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States. Both bills allow for targeting U.S. persons outside the U.S. for up to 90 days with FISC approval. Emergency authorizations require notice to a FISC judge and application for an order within seven days. Acquisition without a FISC order terminates when information is obtained, application is denied, or after seven days. The House and Senate bills differ on the exclusivity of FISA for electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information. Without a FISC order, no information acquired from emergency acquisition can be used in proceedings or disclosed without consent, except in cases of threat with approval from the Attorney General. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 and the House bill both aim to expand the definition of \"foreign power\" and \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to address groups or individuals involved in international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bills also emphasize that FISA is the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance and intercepting domestic communications. Both the House and Senate bills aim to address international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through expanded definitions of key terms. They allow federal officers conducting surveillance to coordinate with law enforcement for investigations. The Senate bill includes retroactive immunity for electronic communication service providers aiding the government between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, while the House bill does not provide this immunity. The House bill does not offer retroactive immunity to electronic communication service providers who aided the government post-9/11 attacks. It includes a procedure for court examination of state secrets in civil actions against these providers. Additionally, it mandates an audit of the Terrorist Surveillance Program by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice. The House bill requires the report to be submitted to specific committees and establishes a Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance. It also provides manpower and training for FISC applications. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 does not address these provisions. A detailed comparison of the two measures is provided, along with a glossary of FISA terms for better understanding. In Title I of FISA, \"foreign power\" includes foreign governments, factions of foreign nations, groups engaged in international terrorism, foreign-based political organizations, and entities directed and controlled by foreign governments. An \"agent of a foreign power\" is a person who acts for or on behalf of a foreign power engaging in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"foreign power\" as foreign governments, factions of foreign nations, groups involved in international terrorism, foreign-based political organizations, and entities controlled by foreign governments. An \"agent of a foreign power\" engages in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States, including activities that violate US criminal statutes. This includes engaging in sabotage, international terrorism, or activities in preparation for such actions on behalf of a foreign power, as well as entering the US under false identities for foreign interests. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"foreign power\" as entities involved in international terrorism or activities in preparation for such actions on behalf of a foreign power. \"International terrorism\" involves violent acts intended to intimidate or coerce civilian populations, influence government policies, or affect government conduct through assassination or kidnapping, occurring outside the United States or transcending national boundaries. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"foreign power\" as entities involved in international terrorism or activities in preparation for such actions on behalf of a foreign power. \"International terrorism\" involves violent acts intended to intimidate or coerce civilian populations, influence government policies, or affect government conduct through assassination, kidnapping, or sabotage outside the United States or transcending national boundaries. \"Sabotage\" refers to activities violating chapter 105 of title 18 or that would involve such a violation against the United States. \"Foreign intelligence information\" includes data related to protecting the United States against foreign power attacks, sabotage, international terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"electronic surveillance\" as the acquisition of wire or radio communications of a known United States person in the United States, under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. It also includes the acquisition of wire communications to or from a person in the United States without consent, but excludes communications of computer trespassers. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"electronic surveillance\" as the intentional acquisition of radio communications in the United States under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. This includes monitoring to acquire information from individuals with a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the use of surveillance devices within the United States. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"electronic surveillance\" as the intentional acquisition of radio communications in the United States under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. Minimization procedures for electronic surveillance involve specific steps to minimize the acquisition and retention of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons, while allowing for the retention and dissemination of information related to crimes for law enforcement purposes. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines \"electronic surveillance\" as the intentional acquisition of radio communications in the United States under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. Procedures for electronic surveillance involve minimizing the acquisition and retention of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons, while allowing for the retention and dissemination of information related to crimes for law enforcement purposes. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines key terms such as \"United States,\" \"Aggrieved person,\" \"Wire communication,\" and \"Person\" in the context of electronic surveillance. These definitions are crucial for understanding the scope and limitations of surveillance activities. The term \"State\" in the context of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) refers to any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and any U.S. territory or possession."
