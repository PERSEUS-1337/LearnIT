Congressional hearings and academic research have shown that minority groups face barriers in accessing capital, expertise, and business networks. The MBDA's mission is to help minority businesses achieve parity in the free enterprise system by coordinating federal policies and programs. The MBDA is responsible for formulating federal policies and programs to support minority business enterprises. Despite lacking statutory authorization, Congress has funded the agency for 48 years. The Trump Administration proposed reducing funding, but the House passed a bill providing $34 million for FY2018. The MBDA, originally established as the OMBE by President Nixon in 1969, promotes minority participation in the economy. Nixon's \"Black Capitalism\" initiative aimed at economic advancement and political power for minorities. The agency has been funded by Congress for 48 years, with the House passing a bill providing $34 million for FY2018. President Nixon established the OMBE within his first 100 days to address racial inequality and social injustice. The OMBE's mission, outlined in E.O. 11458, aimed to strengthen minority business participation in federal activities. The E.O. also created the Advisory Council on Minority Enterprise (ACME) to advise the Secretary of Commerce on supporting minority businesses. The ACME played a key role in increasing minority participation in franchises but faced organizational challenges. The OMBE struggled initially due to organizational difficulties and lack of cooperation from other departments. President Nixon signed E.O. 11625 to clarify and strengthen OMBE's role in promoting minority business participation. The new Executive Order gave the Secretary a mandate to establish Federal policy for minority enterprise, coordinate efforts across departments, and create a network of minority business centers. This marked a shift towards actively supporting minority business development through public-private partnerships. In 1979, the agency was reorganized and renamed the Minority Business Development Agency. In 1979, the Carter Administration reorganized and renamed the agency to the Minority Business Development Agency, aiming to assist minority businesses in becoming medium- and large-size firms in growth industries. Subsequent administrations have continued to refine the agency's focus and delivery of services, including establishing the Minority Business Development Center program in 1981 to provide technical and management services to minority businesses through approximately 100 centers in metropolitan areas. The Minority Business Development Agency provided technical and management services to minority businesses through approximately 100 centers in metropolitan areas. President Reagan issued E.O. 12432 to encourage minority business participation in federal procurement, contracts, and grants. President Bush proposed transferring the agency's mission to the Small Business Administration but ultimately continued it within the Department of Commerce. President Clinton issued E.O. 12928 to promote procurement with socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions. The Clinton Administration supported expanding access to federal procurement contracts for businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, black colleges and universities, and other minority institutions. They sought increases in funding for the MBDA to establish Rural Business Development Centers, MBDCs, and MBOCs. In 1996, a pilot program called CBES was initiated to form strategic alliances for minority and disadvantaged business development. An audit found deficiencies in the administration of the pilot project. The audit of the pilot program by MBDA under the George W. Bush Administration found significant deficiencies in administration, recommending the development of project-specific performance measures and timely evaluation. The administration focused resources on minority firms with $500,000 or more in annual revenues, as they generated a larger percentage of minority revenues and employed more individuals. The agency funded programs and services to support minority firms with significant growth potential, including National Enterprise Centers, MBDCs, and MBOCs. They also funded projects for communities with special needs and initiatives for youth entrepreneurship and access to capital. In the 1990s, the agency shifted focus to help minority firms compete globally. The agency shifted focus in the 1990s to assist minority firms in competing globally. A 2003 MBDA study highlighted the need for updated information on minority businesses' international interactions to design effective policies and programs for their expansion. During the Obama Administration, there was an increased emphasis on quantifying the impact of MBDA activities and improving the efficient delivery of services to minority businesses. The MBDA focuses on assisting minority firms in the global market, quantifying its impact, delivering services efficiently, and coordinating with federal agencies like the SBA and the International Trade Administration. It primarily serves businesses with revenues of at least $1 million annually, focusing on high-growth areas like technology and bio-medicine. MBDA business centers provide services to minority-owned firms looking to expand to new markets, both foreign and domestic. MBDA business centers offer a range of services to minority-owned firms seeking to expand to new markets, including business consulting, private equity opportunities, and strategic partnerships. Operators are eligible to compete for a minimum annual award of $250,000 to run a center for three years, with an option for two additional years. Currently, MBDA funds 31 Business Centers and 10 Specialty Centers dedicated to various areas such as exports, manufacturing, capital formation, and procurement. The MBDA offers a range of services through its 10 Specialty Centers, including those focused on exports, manufacturing, capital formation, and procurement. Despite lacking statutory mandate, Congress has provided over $1.8 billion in appropriations for the agency since its inception. Annual appropriations have remained relatively stable since 1996, fluctuating between $25 million and $31.5 million. The Trump Administration's proposed budget for FY2018 requested $6 million for MBDA, significantly less than the $34 million appropriated for FY2017. The budget would be used to terminate the agency and its activities in 2018 as part of efforts to reduce federal spending. Supporters argue that MBDA's mission is crucial for the nation's economic future, while opponents believe such activities should be handled by state and local governments or the private sector. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $34 million appropriation for the MBDA in FY2018, with a directive for at least 50% to be allocated through cooperative agreements, external awards, and grants. The agency was also required to submit a report on the state of minority businesses within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The language of the bill was later included in an omnibus appropriation measure that passed the House in September 2017. The FY2018 omnibus appropriation measure, H.R. 3354, incorporated the language of the bill approving $34 million for MBDA activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended the same amount for FY2018. Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, funding MBDA at the same rate as FY2017. The Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, funds MBDA at the same rate as FY2017, with a rescission, until December 8, 2017 or until FY2018 CJS appropriations are signed into law. MBDA reported creating or retaining 26,896 jobs in FY2015, with nearly 100,000 jobs from FY2012 to FY2015. Contracts and jobs data are verified by MBDA headquarters staff. In FY2015, minority businesses secured $5.9 billion in contracts and capital with MBDA assistance. In FY2015, minority businesses secured $5.9 billion in contracts and capital with MBDA assistance, representing 72% of the total. The Return on Taxpayer Investment (ROI) declined to $197.4 for every $1 in funds appropriated in FY2015. MBDA has been subject to critical reports regarding its efficacy in assisting minority businesses and program management. The George W. Bush Administration initiated the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in 2002 to evaluate federal programs. A 2007 PART evaluation of the agency found MBDA performance to be Adequate, with high marks for program purpose, design, strategic planning, and program management. The program has developed appropriate measures focusing on the impact of its assistance on business clients, but more research is needed on long-term impact. MBDA awards grants competitively and provides oversight of grant activities. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) has strong management and awards grants through a competitive process with sufficient oversight. While focused on minority small businesses, there are other sources of business assistance at federal, state, and local levels. A 2006 report by the Department of Commerce IG found that MBDA's performance measures were undermined by combining results for different programs and unreliable data. In FY2004, the MBDA combined results for MBOCs with other programs, inflating the number of clients served. The director agreed with recommendations to define key performance measures and report program performance separately. A 1998 audit found deficiencies in monitoring a pilot project for Community-Based Enhancement Services. MBDA concurred with the findings and committed to implementing recommendations. The Nixon Administration did not propose enabling legislation despite creating the MBDA through E.O. 11458. Several bills have been introduced in past Congresses to establish statutory authority for the agency, but none were introduced during the 114th Congress. The 96th Congress considered but did not pass legislative proposals for the agency. During the 99th Congress, legislative proposals were considered to establish a permanent MBDA within the Department of Commerce, granting the agency authority for various activities in support of its mission. Representative Parren Mitchell introduced a bill to deny appropriations to the MBDA to avoid duplication of services with the SBA's Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. During the 101st through the 104th Congress, Representative Kweisi Mfume introduced legislation to re-designate MBDA as the Minority Business Development Administration. The bill aimed to assist disadvantaged businesses in penetrating domestic and foreign markets, encouraging joint ventures, providing financial assistance, conducting pilot projects for access to capital, supporting management education, and conducting research on minority business enterprises. During the 111th Congress, Senator Bob Casey introduced a bill, S. 4026, aimed at improving the Minority Business Development Program by providing technical assistance and contract procurement assistance to qualified minority businesses. The bill outlined qualification requirements for minority businesses and aimed to expand federal procurement opportunities for disadvantaged businesses. Additionally, Representative Bobby L. Rush introduced H.R. 4343 during the same Congress to support minority businesses. During the 111th Congress, Representative Bobby L. Rush introduced H.R. 4343, the Minority Business Development Improvements Act of 2009, which aimed to establish a Minority Business Development Program providing loan guarantees, technical assistance, and contract procurement assistance to qualified minority businesses. The bill defined qualified minority businesses as entities with 51% ownership by historically disadvantaged individuals and net worth limits for principles. It also directed the National Director of MBDA to establish a database for prime contractors, provide set-aside contracting opportunities, and enforce program compliance. During the 111th Congress, Representative Bobby L. Rush introduced H.R. 4343, the Minority Business Development Improvements Act of 2009, aimed at establishing a Minority Business Development Program providing assistance to qualified minority businesses. In subsequent Congresses, bills were introduced to expand opportunities for minority businesses, including provisions for technical assistance, loan guarantees, contract procurement assistance, set-aside contracting opportunities, and database establishment for subcontracting. During the 113th Congress, Representative Bobby Rush introduced the Expanding Opportunities for Main Street Act, which included provisions for the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) similar to those in previous bills. In 2012, the National Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise (NACMBE) recommended centralizing minority business development efforts, facilitating long-term relationships with larger enterprises, and expanding access to capital through tax credits or an enterprise bond fund. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) aims to enhance access to capital for minority-owned businesses through tax credits, an MBE Academy, and a longitudinal database. There is ongoing debate on whether the MBDA complements or duplicates SBA programs for minority business development. Supporters argue that the MBDA focuses on medium and large-scale minority firms, while the SBA supports small and startup minority firms. The MBDA was created by executive order, giving each new President the power to decide its fate. Past proposals to give statutory authority to the MBDA have not been passed. The President can terminate the agency's discretionary activities without congressional consent, but Congress can appropriate funds to support its purposes or revoke the executive order. Congress may also codify the executive order's provisions."
