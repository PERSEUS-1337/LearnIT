The \"Give Fans a Chance Act of 2001\" adds conditions to the Antitrust Exemption Act, stating that it does not apply to professional sports leagues with restrictions on ownership transfers to the public or non-compliance with relocation rules. Clubs must give notice 180 days before relocating or being eliminated from their home territory. The \"Give Fans a Chance Act of 2001\" requires clubs to provide notice to interested persons 180 days before relocating or being eliminated from their home territory. The notice must be in writing, delivered in person or by certified mail, made available to the news media, published in newspapers, and include details about the proposed relocation or elimination. Additionally, the notice must offer an opportunity for interested parties to purchase the club.

If successful, the club's ownership structure will not affect its league membership. Additionally, the club must allow interested parties to present proposals to persuade them to stay. During the 180-day notice period, interested parties can present proposals to keep the club in its home community. The club owner must respond in writing, stating reasons for refusal of any offer. The league will make a determination on relocation or elimination before the notice period expires. Hearings will be conducted for interested persons to present testimony. During the 180-day notice period, interested parties can present proposals to keep the club in its home community. The league will consider any inducement proposals and criteria listed in subsection (c) before making a decision on relocation or elimination.

During the club's operation, factors considered for relocation or elimination include engagement in negotiations, ownership contributions to circumstances, public financial support, stadium adequacy, and financial losses. Factors considered for relocation or elimination of a club include deficiencies in the facility, net operating losses threatening financial viability, presence of another club in the same home community, proposed relocation to a community with another club, opposition from the stadium authority, and presence of a bona fide investor offering fair market value.
