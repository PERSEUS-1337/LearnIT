The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens were detained, beaten, and used as \"human shields\" by Iraq. Iraq was classified as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time. The American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damage due to state-sponsored torture and terrorism by Iraq. After the Gulf War, they were welcomed home as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's treatment of captured US service members and amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to hold Iraq accountable for the torture of American POWs. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was amended to allow torture victims like American POWs from the Gulf War to seek compensation from terrorist countries, including Iraq. 17 Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in court seeking compensation for damages related to their torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. In 2003, former POWs were awarded damages for torture by Iraq, but have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President. They are unable to pursue their claims in US courts. In December 2001, the United States district court held Iraq liable for taking US citizens hostage after the invasion of Kuwait, awarding damages to 180 former hostages. On March 20, 2003, the President directed payment of judgments from blocked Iraqi accounts and confiscated remaining assets for Iraq reconstruction. Over 200 US citizens with similar claims are awaiting judgment in Vine v. Republic of Iraq. The plaintiffs in Vine v. Republic of Iraq, who were held hostage in Iraqi territory, are seeking compensation in a US district court. However, they are unable to enforce any judgment due to a waiver granted to Iraq by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. The United States, as a party to the Third Geneva Convention, is prohibited from absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war. The US has a moral obligation to protect its citizens from torture and hostage-taking. The Congress is committed to holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable for acts of torture and hostage-taking against United States citizens. If certain cases against Iraq are not settled within 30 days, the waiver authority granted to the President will terminate. These cases are numbered in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Congress aims to hold state sponsors of terrorism accountable for acts of torture and hostage-taking against US citizens. Cases against Iraq in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia must be settled within 30 days, or the President's waiver authority will end. Adequate settlement involves payment by Iraq or a US depository institution to individuals with hostage claims, with a minimum payment of $150,000 plus $6,000 per day held hostage, not exceeding $900,000. The compensation for individuals held hostage includes a minimum payment of $150,000 plus $6,000 per day, not exceeding $900,000. Spouses or children of hostages may receive one-third of the qualifying amount. Under this section, individuals who qualify for payment under specific paragraphs may receive one-third of the qualifying amount. Additionally, individuals with compensatory damages judgments may receive payment of the unsatisfied amount, capped at $1,000,000. The term \"hostage\" is defined as an individual in hostage status or seized during an act of hostage taking. The term \"hostage\" refers to an individual in hostage status or seized during an act of hostage taking. Hostage status, hostage taking, person, torture, and United States are defined in specific laws. The term \"United States depository institution\" refers to a financial institution organized under the laws of a State, the District of Columbia, or the United States. Additionally, certain provisions in specific laws were not intended to remove jurisdiction over cases brought under a particular section of the United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. Section 1083(c) of the NDAA applies to cases specified in subsection (b)(2) regardless of any waiver for Iraq."
