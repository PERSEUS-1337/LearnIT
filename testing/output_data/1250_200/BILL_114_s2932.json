    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2016\". The Congress recognizes the importance of controlled substances in emergency medical services to save lives and improve health outcomes. There is a need for regulatory oversight to prevent diversion in all healthcare settings, including emergency medical services. Regulatory oversight is crucial to prevent diversion of controlled substances in emergency medical services, tailored to unique care delivery models and promoting uniformity of rules across different types of agencies. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act adds regulations for emergency medical services. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act defines key terms related to emergency medical services, including emergency medical services, emergency medical services agency, and emergency medical services practitioner. The term 'medical director' refers to a physician overseeing an emergency medical services agency, providing medical oversight. 'Medical oversight' involves supervising the medical operations of the agency. 'Standing order' is a written protocol by a medical director for administering controlled substances in emergencies. 'Verbal order' is a verbal prescription for administering controlled substances. 'Online medical direction' is verbal guidance from a physician to emergency medical services practitioners on patient care. The term 'registrant emergency medical services agency' refers to an agency registered under subsection (b) or a hospital that owns and operates an emergency medical services agency. Registration enables emergency medical services practitioners to dispense controlled substances to patients. The Attorney General requires a single registration per State for emergency medical services agencies, with tailored guidance recognizing different care delivery models. Registrant agencies must have one or more medical directors for oversight. The agency must have at least one licensed physician serving as a medical director responsible for overseeing emergency medical services, including making decisions on patient transportation and approving medical protocols. The emergency medical services agency oversees patient evaluation, treatment, interventions, online medical direction, drug formularies, medication administration, medical education, training programs, and quality improvement. Controlled substances in schedule II-V may be administered under state authority. Emergency medical services practitioners of a registrant agency can administer controlled substances in schedule II-V under state authority with a standing order or online medical direction from a medical director or licensed physician in specific circumstances. The medical director can provide verbal orders for administering controlled substances in specific patient situations to ensure proper care, without the need to be present or provide a written prescription. A registrant emergency medical services agency is not required to be present or provide a written prescription for administering controlled substances to known individuals. The agency must keep standing orders on file and make them available to the Attorney General upon request. Practitioners must document receiving verbal orders from online medical direction and the administration of controlled substances in patient care charts, which should be made available to the Attorney General upon request. The registrant emergency medical services agency can receive, move, and store controlled substances at designated locations. They are not considered distributors by moving or delivering these substances. Storage can occur at any designated agency location. The emergency medical services agency can store controlled substances at designated locations, and they are not allowed to store them at any undesignated location. This section does not affect requirements under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act and does not limit the Attorney General's authority to enforce controlled substance diversion."
