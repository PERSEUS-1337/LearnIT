    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patenting human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. Courts and the USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. In recent years, Section 101 has been used more frequently to invalidate patents. The Supreme Court decisions since 2010 have increased the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject patent applications at the USPTO. This has led to concerns about the U.S. patent system being in a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards established by the Court. Former Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit described the situation as creating \"total chaos.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit criticized Supreme Court decisions for causing \"total chaos\" in patent policy. Some believe the decisions could lead to better patents and reduce litigation. The report reviews patent law, recent proposals for reform, and the impact on IT and life sciences industries. It also discusses the process of obtaining patent protection through the USPTO. To obtain patent protection, applicants must submit applications to the USPTO. Examiners assess the applications to determine if they meet patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. The application must include a detailed description of the invention and at least one claim that distinctly points out the subject matter. The process of obtaining a patent is known as \"prosecution.\" To be patentable, an invention must be nonobvious and useful, falling within a category of patentable subject matter as defined in Section 101 of the Patent Act. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. Process patents cover methods of manufacture or use, including making a product or using a chemical compound for treatment. The Supreme Court defines \"machine\" as any mechanical device to perform a function, \"manufacture\" as producing articles from materials, and \"composition of matter\" as compositions of substances. While Section 101 is broad, there are limits on patenting processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The USPTO has limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court views these as essential tools for scientific and technological work. If a patent application meets requirements, it can be granted for a term of twenty years, giving inventors limited exclusivity. The patent term is usually twenty years from the filing date, providing inventors with exclusivity to practice or license their inventions. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate in federal courts to enforce their rights. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed patentable subject matter, with the last major ruling in Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980. The Supreme Court's recent decisions have narrowed patent eligibility, impacting the patent system significantly. Previous rulings in Diamond v. Chakrabarty and Diamond v. Diehr set a broad range of patentable subject matter. However, from 2010 to 2014, the Court deemed inventions unpatentable under Section 101 in four decisions. This report discusses each decision in order of issuance. In its 2010 decision Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a method of hedging risk in commodities trading. The USPTO rejected the application as claiming subject matter ineligible for patenting under Section 101. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for a method of hedging risk in commodities trading, stating that it did not claim patentable subject matter under Section 101. The court determined that the claimed process was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus and did not achieve a physical transformation. The USPTO decision to deny Bilski's patent application was affirmed by then-Chief Judge Michel. The Supreme Court issued three opinions, with Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court concluding that Bilski's invention could not be patented based on the traditional rule that abstract ideas are not patentable subject matter. The machine or transformation test was considered an important clue but not the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. Justice Kennedy concluded that ideas like hedging were not patentable subject matter, as they were considered fundamental economic practices. He argued that granting patents for such ideas would lead to a monopoly over abstract concepts. Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion, agreed with the machine-or-transformation test but believed it should not be the only criteria for patentability. Justice Breyer also concurred, highlighting that the range of patentable subject matter is broad but not unlimited, and the machine-or-transformation test is useful but not exclusive. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences, specifically patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs. The patents claim methods of administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the results to reduce toxicity and enhance effectiveness. The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole standard for assessing patentability. The Supreme Court concluded that claims related to optimizing drug dosage based on metabolite levels for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Supreme Court unanimously concluded that claims directed towards natural laws, specifically the relationship between thiopurine metabolite concentration and drug effectiveness, were unpatentable. The Court recognized that while inventions may apply natural laws, the claims in question included additional steps beyond just the law of nature. The Supreme Court ruled that claims involving the relationship between thiopurine metabolite concentration and drug effectiveness were unpatentable. The Court found that the additional steps in the claims did not make them patent-eligible processes. Justice Breyer explained that simply applying a natural law to a specific audience or environment did not make it patentable. The Court determined that routine steps like measuring metabolite levels did not add enough to qualify for a patent. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising physicians to consider natural laws in their practices did not make unpatentable laws of nature patentable. Justice Breyer stated that the three steps in the claim did not transform natural correlations into patentable applications. The Court also rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, as they only required measuring metabolite levels, not transforming human blood. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that measuring metabolite levels did not transform natural correlations into patentable applications. Justice Breyer explained that the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability, and rejected the idea that any step beyond a law of nature should fulfill Section 101 standards. He also addressed concerns that rejecting the Prometheus patents would discourage diagnostic research. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. While products of nature cannot be patented, they may be if significant artificial changes are made, such as isolating or purifying them. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, but some experts disagreed with this approach. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad challenged the patenting of human genes, specifically BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad Genetics, Inc. held exclusive rights to genetic testing for these genes. The lawsuit filed by the Association for Molecular Pathology and others argued that gene patent claims were invalid. The lawsuit challenged Myriad Genetics' gene patent claims related to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for breast and ovarian cancer testing. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patents, but the Federal Circuit reversed the decision, stating that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad did not create anything by discovering the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and that isolating DNA does not constitute an act of invention. The Court was unimpressed by Myriad's claims regarding isolated DNA. The Supreme Court found that isolated DNA does not constitute an act of invention and is not patent eligible under \u00a7101. However, they viewed synthetic DNA, known as cDNA, more favorably as it is distinct from naturally occurring DNA and can be patented. The Court did not consider the patentability of altered DNA sequences or innovative gene manipulation methods in the Myriad case. The Supreme Court ruled that isolated DNA is not patent eligible under \u00a7101, while synthetic DNA (cDNA) can be patented as it is a synthetic creation not found in nature. In a recent decision, the Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system designed to mitigate settlement risk. The Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system to mitigate settlement risk. The patents were deemed unpatentable as they represented a basic business concept. The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court upheld this decision, ruling the patents directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that the patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying such patents, focusing on whether the claim incorporates an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying the abstract idea to a specific technological environment. The Court found the method claims were drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, a fundamental economic practice. In Mayo v. Prometheus, the Court determined that the method claims were based on the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, a fundamental economic practice. The patented claims were seen as mere implementation of an abstract idea on a computer, lacking an inventive concept to make them patent-eligible. The Court rejected the computer system and computer-readable media claims for the same reason, stating that they only incorporated generic computer hardware without meaningful technological restrictions. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The courts use a two-part test to determine if a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if it includes additional inventive elements. If a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented. The Court does not consider a claim's recitation of routine hardware to overcome patent eligibility concerns. The courts use a two-part test to determine patent eligibility under Section 101, with routine hardware not sufficient to overcome concerns. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost in decision-making. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation, with a high probability of invalidating challenged patents. Statistical analysis shows a 66.5% invalidation rate for patents challenged under \u00a7101 motions, with the Federal Circuit invalidating 91.9% of patents. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice, indicating success in challenging patent claims not compliant with Section 101. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has implications for information technologies and life sciences. Recent Supreme Court case law has had significant implications for information technologies, leading to the invalidation of numerous patents on computer-related inventions. Patent claims that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are most vulnerable to challenges under Section 101. Invalidated patent claims included inventions such as generating menus, collecting data on power grids, and extracting data from hard copy documents using conventional technology. The curr_chunk discusses various patents invalidated due to lack of specific technological improvements, including systems for administering life insurance policies and processing credit applications. One patent involved a broadcast system allowing out-of-region access to local content, deemed an abstract idea by the Federal Circuit. Judge Bryson explained that conveying regional content to out-of-region recipients is a common practice in various forms of media. The patent in question was not directed towards implementing out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone but rather focused on the idea itself. The Federal Circuit concluded that the patent did not describe how the invention achieved its functions, only limiting the idea to cellular telephones, which did not satisfy Section 101. The Federal Circuit has upheld patents in cases involving e-commerce systems, information management systems, Internet content filtering, and automatic animation methods. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, affecting the patentability of predictive diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed the interaction of Section 101 with life sciences compared to information technologies. The 2015 ruling of the Federal Circuit in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom is one such decision that sheds light on this issue. The 2015 ruling of the Federal Circuit in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom involved a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The inventors discovered cell-free fetal DNA and developed a method to determine fetal characteristics. The Federal Circuit ruled that a method for detecting paternally inherited ccfDNA in material plasma or serum was not patentable as it involved a naturally occurring phenomenon and conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the breakthrough nature of the invention in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Congress has the option to address the issue through legislation, but as of now, no action has been taken. As of now, no action has been taken by Congress to address the issue of patentable subject matter. However, industry associations like AIPLA and IPO have proposed modifications to Section 101 of the law. Their proposals aim to broaden the scope of patentable inventions by replacing the existing language with more inclusive criteria. The IPO and American Bar Association have proposed changes to Section 101 of patent law to broaden the scope of patentable inventions, regardless of existing requirements or conditions. The AIPLA asserts that Section 101 of patent law allows for patent eligibility of inventions, with consideration of practical applications and limitations, without being negated by patentability criteria. The AIPLA and ABA Section on Intellectual Property criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility determination, while the IPO argues that the Court's analysis is contrary to congressional intent. Some believe legislative reform is unnecessary, as restrictive patent eligibility rules have not impacted innovation or investment significantly. Some commentators argue that proposed amendments could eliminate limits on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal may change patentability standards, potentially impacting common law rules. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has sparked debate on maintaining a balance between innovation and patent eligibility. The debate over patenting in certain fields has sparked concerns about the balance between innovation and patent rights. Some experts believe Section 101 maintains this balance, while others worry about the impact on innovation and investment. These discussions may lead to further examination of what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
