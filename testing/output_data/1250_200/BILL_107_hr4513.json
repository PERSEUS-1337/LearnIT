    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Number Protection Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that the sale or purchase of Social Security numbers contributes to illegal activities like fraud and identity theft, posing risks to individual privacy. Social Security numbers, required by the Federal Government for various purposes, have inadvertently become tools for crime and fraud. The sale of Social Security numbers poses risks to individual privacy and contributes to illegal activities like fraud and identity theft. The numbers themselves do not convey any meaningful message or public concern, and profiting from their sale should be restricted to prevent abuse of the system. (6) No one should profit from selling Social Security numbers if it puts individuals at risk of harm. (7) Congress should pass laws to protect individuals from the sale of Social Security numbers that could lead to unlawful activities or unfair practices. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission, \"person\" includes individuals and entities, \"sale\" involves exchanging a Social Security number for value excluding government benefit applications, and \"purchase\" is providing value for a Social Security number. The term \"Social Security number\" or \"Social Security account number\" excludes their submission for government benefits or data matching programs. The term \"State\" includes all states and territories of the United States. Regulation of the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers and account numbers is addressed in Section 4. Regulations prohibit the sale or purchase of Social Security numbers in violation of Commission regulations. The Commission will restrict such transactions to prevent unfair practices, with limitations to ensure security. The regulations aim to prevent fraud and harm by restricting the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers, with exceptions for law enforcement, national security, public health, and emergency situations. The regulations allow for the use of Social Security numbers for public health, emergency situations, and research with strict privacy safeguards in place. The regulations under subsection (b) of this section require appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy and confidentiality of identifiable individuals. The Commission must promulgate these regulations within one year of the enactment of the Act. In accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, regulations under subsection (b) will take effect 30 days after publication. Violations will be treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission will enforce the regulations with the same powers and duties as under the FTC Act. Any person who violates regulations under this Act will be subject to penalties and entitled to privileges and immunities as provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act. States can bring civil actions on behalf of residents if they believe their interests are affected by violations of Commission regulations. The attorney general of a state can take legal action in a federal court to stop violations of regulations, enforce compliance, seek damages or restitution, and obtain other appropriate relief on behalf of residents. Before filing a lawsuit, the state attorney general must notify the Commission and the Attorney General. If providing notice before filing is not feasible, the attorney general must still provide written notice. The State attorney general must notify the Commission and the Attorney General before filing a lawsuit. Upon receiving notice, both entities have the right to intervene, stay the action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. If criminal or civil proceedings are already ongoing, actions may be stayed pending their final disposition. During ongoing criminal or civil proceedings initiated by the General or Federal Trade Commission for violations of the Act, no State can bring a separate action against the same defendant for the same violation. However, State attorney generals can still conduct investigations and bring civil actions in their own jurisdiction. The venue for any action under this section can be in any district court. Any action under this section can be brought in any district court of the United States that meets venue requirements. Process can be served in any district where the defendant is located."
