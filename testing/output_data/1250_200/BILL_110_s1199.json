    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that nanotechnology is rapidly growing and will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. It is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the US. To maximize these benefits, the US must maintain leadership in nanotechnology despite competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US in 2003. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education. This includes providing access to scientific tools like scanning electron microscopes and training for teachers. The purpose of this Act is to strengthen the capacity of US schools and institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology through grants. The Act aims to provide grants to secondary schools and higher education institutions in the United States to equip students with the necessary tools for careers in nanotechnology.

SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants to eligible institutions for teaching nanotechnology. Grants can be used for equipment, educational services, and teacher education. The National Science Foundation will provide grants to eligible institutions for teaching nanotechnology in schools. Grants can be used for equipment, educational services, and teacher education. To be eligible for a grant, institutions must submit an application to the Director with required information. Grants have limitations on the use of funds for software, educational services, and teacher education. Funds awarded to community colleges or higher education institutions can only be used in undergraduate programs.
