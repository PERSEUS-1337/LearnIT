Military regimes have ruled directly for 34 out of 60 years, with no sustained history of effective constitutionalism. The armed forces see themselves as \"saviors of the nation,\" leading to three seizures of power from civilian governments. After 1970, five governments in Pakistan were removed by the army, not voted out. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was executed, Benazir Bhutto exiled and assassinated, and Nawaz Sharif faced exile and threats of imprisonment. Political turmoil led to a lack of understanding of democracy among Pakistanis. In 2008, Pakistan was ranked as the 33rd weakest country due to political instability and security issues.

The assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 severely impacted Pakistan's security and political stability.

Musharraf's controversial reelection and subsequent resignation added to the turmoil in the country. President Musharraf faced mounting domestic and international pressure, leading to his resignation from his military commission six weeks later. Popular opposition to military rule grew steadily due to a series of political crises in 2007, including a bungled attempt to dismiss the Chief Justice, Supreme Court rulings damaging Musharraf's credibility, and constitutional questions about his presidency. Musharraf's \"second coup\" in November 2007, suspending the Constitution and assuming emergency powers, was seen as a move to maintain his own power amidst deteriorating security circumstances. His government dismissed uncooperative Supreme Court justices, jailed opposition figures, and cracked down on lawyers opposing the abrogation of the rule of law.
