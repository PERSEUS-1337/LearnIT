    "content": "The \"State-Run Federal Lands Act\" defines qualifying federal land and the Secretary concerned, allowing states to petition for management of certain federal lands. Beginning 30 days after enactment, a State can petition to manage certain Federal lands. The Secretary must approve or deny the petition within 90 days. Approval is based on the State's funding, completeness of the petition, and compliance with required terms. The petition for managing Federal lands must meet all required terms, or if a State had a previous agreement terminated, the new petition may be denied. If a petition is denied, the State will receive written notice with reasons for denial and can amend and resubmit the petition. If the Secretary does not approve or deny a petition within 90 days, it will be deemed approved along with the proposed cooperative agreement. The petition must include a letter from the Governor, a map of qualifying Federal lands, the proposed cooperative agreement, proof of funding, and any other required documentation. The cooperative agreement must also contain specific contents. A cooperative agreement submitted under subsection (e)(2) must include a statement that the State will manage certain qualifying Federal lands for a specified term, a cost-sharing requirement of at least 50% from the State, determination of State's contribution after a cost assessment, and provisions for natural disasters. The State shall manage qualifying Federal lands, including employee salary data. In the event of a natural disaster, the State assumes authority over recovery initiatives, sharing costs with the Federal government. Revenue from the lands will be distributed to State and Federal entities according to a cost-sharing agreement. The revenue from qualifying Federal lands will be distributed to State and Federal entities based on a cost-sharing agreement. Procedures for transitioning management from Federal to State control include guarantees for Federal employees and the State's ability to hire additional staff for managing the lands. The transfer of management authority over qualifying Federal lands to the State includes provisions for State-appointed staff, transfer of special use permits, continued mineral entry under State law, and joint petitions for lands crossing State lines. The cooperative agreement allows States to manage qualifying Federal lands, with State laws taking precedence over Federal laws if more restrictive. The United States retains ownership of the lands. The agreement can be terminated if the State defaults on a payment. The cooperative agreement can be terminated if the State defaults on a payment, is in breach of the agreement, or if the agreement itself contains a termination clause. If the State no longer finds the agreement beneficial, they can petition the Secretary for intentional termination, which will be approved or denied within 90 days."
