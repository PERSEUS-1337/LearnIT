    "content": "Estimating image location is challenging due to contextual complexities. This work introduces a global meshing strategy for image geolocation, overcoming data limitations and improving model performance by incorporating additional information. Delaunay triangles are shown to be effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Incorporating time of posting and user metadata can improve geolocation by up to 11% at the country level. By incorporating additional information such as time of posting and user metadata, geolocation accuracy can be improved by up to 11% at the country level and 3% at the city level. Advancements in deep learning have expanded the capabilities of machine learning in computer vision, allowing for more in-depth analysis of contextual information in images. Estimating the geographic origin of ground-level images presents challenges due to uneven distribution of geo-tagged data and potential conflicting information. The work focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images. With the rise of image-based social media, inferring geographic context from images without explicit geolocation information is a significant challenge. The paper discusses approaches for geolocation from image content, building on recent work in global geolocation from ground-based imagery. Various methods, such as instance-level scene retrieval and data sampling strategies, are considered for geolocation of imagery on social media platforms. The paper explores data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications, focusing on weighted sampling of minority classes and biased class selection during deep learning model training. The study considers sampling without respect to individual users, raising concerns about the influence of latent variables and communities in social media geolocation. Different models are proposed, including geolocation based on image content, incorporating time information, and utilizing user-album inputs. The study introduces different models for geolocation in social media, including one based on image content (M1), another using an alternative mesh for geolocation (M2), and a third incorporating time and user information (M3). Data is collected from YFCC100M BID17, with training and validation on a subset of geolabeled imagery. User-id and posted-time metadata are crucial for determining the true GPS location of an image. The study presents models for geolocation in social media based on image content, an alternative mesh, and incorporating time and user information. Data is collected from YFCC100M, with training and validation on geolabeled imagery. User-id and posted-time metadata are essential for determining the true GPS location of an image. The global-scale geolocation model subdivides the globe into a grid for classification regions, with a classifier trained to recognize imagery with ground truth GPS. The distribution of image longitudes varies by the time of day an image is posted, affecting the prediction of longitude. The study introduces a new mesh architecture for geolocation in social media imagery. It uses a Delaunay triangle-based mesh to classify imagery based on ground truth GPS data. This approach differs from the PlaNet method, which uses a quad-tree mesh. The triangular mesh is chosen for its adaptability to Earth's geometric features, particularly water/land interfaces. However, it lacks the refinement level control of a quad-tree structure. Cells are adaptively refined based on the number of examples they contain or dropped from classification if necessary.

Cells are adaptively refined based on the number of examples they contain or dropped from classification if necessary. Parameters for mesh initialization were not explored, and three meshes were generated with different refinement levels. The study introduces a new mesh architecture for geolocation in social media imagery using a Delaunay triangle-based mesh. The fine mesh does a better job at representing geographic regions compared to the coarse mesh. The Inception v4 convolutional neural network architecture is deployed for developing the mesh-based classification geolocation model. The study introduces a new mesh architecture for geolocation in social media imagery using a Delaunay triangle-based mesh. A classification geolocation model (Model M1) is presented, utilizing a softmax classification approach. Significant improvements are expected for coarse meshes, with models evaluated based on the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates. The study utilizes a great-circle distance formula to classify images based on geolocation. Error thresholds are set for different distance ranges, and image metadata such as user id and posting time are considered in the model. The output of the classification model is analyzed for geolocation class probabilities. The study incorporates time dependence in geolocation models by appending related variables to the output of the classification model. A new input is formed for the model, which filters fit probabilities and utilizes Bidirectional LSTMs to capitalize on correlations in a single user's images. The research question focuses on the effectiveness of organizing images sequentially in time for geolocation. The study explores the effectiveness of organizing images sequentially in time for geolocation. All images from a user are grouped into albums of size 24, with album averaging considered for increased accuracy. LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images is also explored. The study investigates the use of LSTM on time-ordered image sequences for geolocation. Meshing parameters are analyzed to understand the trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation, with results shown in TAB1. The coarse mesh improves large granularity geolocation, while the fine mesh performs better at finer-granularities. The study compares the performance of coarse and fine mesh geolocation models, with the coarse mesh showing significant improvement in large granularity geolocation. The BID20 model, used with indoor-outdoor labels, filters geolocation inference on outdoor imagery without retraining. Results show a 4-8% accuracy improvement for region/country localities. The Im2GPS testing data is used to evaluate the model, showing improved performance even without retraining on the testing set. The study compares the performance of coarse and fine mesh geolocation models, with the coarse mesh showing significant improvement in large granularity geolocation. The imagery centroid classification labels are generated with the YFCC100M training data, yet the performance is greatly improved when applied to the Im2GPS testing set. The M1 classification model's performance is comparable to BID19 with less training data and fewer classification regions. Use of time improves geolocation accuracy, with a small persistent advantage seen across all error calculations. The study compares coarse and fine mesh geolocation models, with coarse mesh showing significant improvement in large granularity geolocation. Time input models have lower bias class probabilities and improve geolocation accuracy. The difference in errors between M1 and M2 models is highly significant, with M2 not explained by chance alone. Median errors for coarse mesh are 1627 km for e1 and 1262 km for e2. KL-Divergence is calculated for each model to minimize class biases. The study compares coarse and fine mesh geolocation models, with coarse mesh showing significant improvement in large granularity geolocation. Time input models have lower bias class probabilities and improve geolocation accuracy. KL-Divergence is calculated for each model to minimize class biases. \"User-Averaging\" is incorporated into results, but biases cell count frequency. LSTMs on user albums had the lowest class bias. The study compares coarse and fine mesh geolocation models, with LSTMs on user albums showing the lowest class bias. Time inputs improve accuracy and lower bias, with significant improvements observed in large granularity geolocation. Conditioning on latent variables can enhance geolocation models, and using time of day in the models increases accuracy. Time information improves both coarse and fine mesh models. Using time information improves geolocation accuracy significantly. Indoor/outdoor scene classification enhances validation accuracy, with outdoor-only results outperforming all images. Future work could involve incorporating the probability of an image being outdoor into the model. Increasing grid granularity reduces country/regional accuracy but improves street/city level accuracy. Fine mesh geoinferencing is more accurate than coarse mesh, especially at street level. The study demonstrates that a coarse mesh grid is superior for 200 km resolutions, while a Delunary triangle-based mesh allows for accurate model training with fewer examples. Images were split into training and validation sets, with further subdivision for time-based models. Softmax classification struggles with large output classes, prompting the development of a training procedure for large meshes. The training procedure for large meshes involved pre-training the model on ImageNet with Adagrad, increasing training examples each epoch by 6%, oversampling minority classes initially, reducing class bias after each training cycle, and training the final model with SGD using a decreasing learning rate. The final model was trained with SGD using a linearly decreasing learning rate reduced at 4% with each epoch, without class biasing and with the full dataset per epoch. The initial value of the learning rate varied for each model. M2 is trained using He initializations, Adaboost, and ADAM at different learning rates. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The generality of the classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on random Im2GPS data. The latent class distribution is assumed constant between training, testing, and application. The last layer output from networks is a softmax model for classification distribution. The KL-divergence between q and p should be low if training is done well. The entropy of p and q is also considered for completeness."
