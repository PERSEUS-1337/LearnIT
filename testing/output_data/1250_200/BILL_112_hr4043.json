    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters, and that national defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected the otters. Continued expansion of the otter population into the designated management zone may have national security impacts due to evolving military training programs. The Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits. Public Law 99-625 allows otters at San Nicolas Island to be designated as a nonessential experimental population for military readiness. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter while ensuring military readiness activities. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates in the waters near Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include specific coordinates near Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. Activities within these areas may result in incidental takings under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt incidental takings of southern sea otters from the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act during military activities. Otters in these areas are treated as proposed endangered species for compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt southern sea otters from certain laws, allowing for military activities without removal of otters. The Secretary of the Interior can revise exceptions if military activities hinder otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor these areas every three years for population changes. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the population changes. Reports on the monitoring must be submitted to Congress and the public. Additionally, an ecosystem management plan is to be developed to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter in waters off the coast of California. The ecosystem management plan for waters off the coast of California aims to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, endangered black abalone, and white abalone, as well as maintain commercial shellfish fisheries at current levels. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the habitat's carrying capacity for sea otters and continue implementing the relocation and management plan until a new plan is in place. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the management of southern sea otters, including incidental taking, optimum sustainable population, the definition of southern sea otter, and the term 'take'. These definitions are crucial for understanding the regulations and management of the species. The term 'take' in relation to activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act is defined in those statutes. 'Military readiness activity' is defined as per the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act, encompassing combat-related training and equipment testing. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act defines 'military readiness activity' as combat-related training and equipment testing, including the evaluation of sensors for combat use.
