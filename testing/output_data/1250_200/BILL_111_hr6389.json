    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant health issue, being the second leading cause of cancer death among men. In 2009, over 190,000 new cases were diagnosed, resulting in more than 27,000 deaths. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer. Younger men are also at risk, with aggressive forms appearing in early middle age. Racial and ethnic disparities exist, with African-Americans having double the mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations face higher mortality rates, and innovative methods like telehealth should be utilized to improve access to quality care for prostate cancer. Advances in telehealth can be used to diagnose and treat prostate cancer. Urologists are the specialists who typically handle prostate cancer cases. Many unanswered questions remain about the causes and treatment of prostate cancer, leading to significant overtreatment. A significant proportion of cases may be clinically indolent and overdiagnosed. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify best practices for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease, leading to less physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for patients and significant cost savings in healthcare systems. Prostate cancer coordination and education are essential for improving accountability and translating research into practice. This will lead to better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment practices, reducing trauma for patients and saving costs in healthcare systems. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force. The Task Force will develop a summary of advances in prostate cancer research, compile best practices for health care programs, consider guidance for screening men over 74, and coordinate information on Federal research and health care activities. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will share information on Federal research and health care programs, identify gaps, promote research translation into practice, and advise on collaborative research proposals to study factors related to prostate cancer etiology. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to develop innovative approaches for studying prostate cancer, outline key research questions, ensure consistent action, coordinate messages on screening and treatment, and make recommendations for improving research and health care programs within two years of its establishment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to improve research portfolios of federal agencies, prevent duplication, increase public participation in decision-making, and enhance dissemination of information on prostate cancer research and healthcare progress. The Prostate Cancer Task Force focuses on disseminating information on research progress, expanding partnerships between public and private entities, assessing cost savings, identifying priority action items, and determining funding needs for implementing recommendations. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, composed of representatives from various federal agencies, appoints expert advisory panels to provide input on prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and research. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, comprised of experts in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, meets at least twice a year to discuss recommendations for Congress. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force, with an exception for termination of the committee. SEC. 4. PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to intensify prostate cancer research. This program aims to develop better diagnostic methods, understand the causes of the disease, and expand basic research into prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Research Program aims to improve prevention efforts, expand basic research, identify novel agents for treatment, establish clinical registries, and utilize imaging modalities. A Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board will accelerate research data sharing and medicine development. The Underserved Minority Grant Program will award grants for research components. The Prostate Cancer Research Program will award grants to carry out research on comparative effectiveness, address disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, barriers in access to care, and needed outreach and educational efforts for underserved minorities and men with a family history of prostate cancer. The program will also focus on appropriate access and utilization of imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved areas, prioritizing African-Americans, Latin-Americans, American Indians, and rural populations. Eligible entities will be selected to participate in these projects. The Secretary will evaluate the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer in underserved areas using telehealth services, improving nonmedical providers' capacity, and exploring innovative medical home models with collaboration between specialists and primary care teams. The Secretary will evaluate the delivery of care for prostate cancer in underserved areas using telehealth services, physician extenders, and tumor boards for patient counseling. A report on pilot project outcomes, cost savings, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, focusing on encouraging men to seek screening. The campaign will address racial disparities and target men with a family history of prostate cancer. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is authorized for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to carry out the Act."
