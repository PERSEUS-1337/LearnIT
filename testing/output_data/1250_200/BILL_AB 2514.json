    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance is set at 5% of property tax allocated to the successor agency for a specific period, with a minimum threshold of $250,000 unless reduced by oversight board or agreement. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller, minus previous year's costs and loan repayments. The minimum allowance is $250,000 unless reduced by oversight board or agreement. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed for enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, excluding costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under a specific section. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes specific criteria. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes bonds, loans, and payments required by the federal government or state law. A \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under a specific section. Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base as confirmed by agreements. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations remain payable if the employee is transferred to the entity assuming the housing functions of the former agency. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee-related costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. They can also terminate agreements or contracts with approval and provide necessary compensation. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements required for the successor agency's operation, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must be in accordance with the law. Legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts can only be paid from the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions, including challenges to the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided must be repaid. If the case is lost, the funds are considered a grant and not eligible for repayment. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. For the purposes of this part, enforceable obligations do not include agreements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former agency. Written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding prior obligations by June 27, 2011, may be deemed enforceable. Loan agreements within two years of the agency's creation may also be considered enforceable obligations. The creation of a redevelopment agency by a city, county, or city and county may result in enforceable obligations within two years. Agreements made before June 28, 2011, related to state highway infrastructure improvements are enforceable. Additionally, agreements requiring repayment of loans or development obligations imposed by federal agencies are also considered enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that were not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts. Indebtedness obligations refer to financing instruments issued to fund redevelopment projects. An oversight board is established pursuant to Section 34179. The oversight board is established under Section 34179 and is responsible for overseeing recognized obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The schedule outlines minimum payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations until June 30, 2016, and from July 1, 2016, onwards for each fiscal year. Taxing entities, including cities, counties, special districts, and school entities, receive passthrough payments and property tax distributions. Successor agencies take over former redevelopment agency responsibilities. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to property taxes, departments, sponsoring entities, final judicial determinations, and housing entity administrative cost allowance from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds, the unpaid amount can be listed on subsequent payment schedules until fully paid, without a five-year time limit."
