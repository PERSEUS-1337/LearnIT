This approach combines learning discrete speech representations with context prediction, offering a new perspective on speech representation learning. The vq-wav2vec algorithm learns discrete representations of audio segments through a context prediction task, enabling the application of NLP algorithms to speech data. It uses Gumbel-Softmax or online k-means clustering for quantization and combines with BERT pre-training for state-of-the-art results in phoneme classification and speech recognition tasks. The BERT model outperforms log-mel filterbank inputs and wav2vec representations on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks. Discretization of audio allows for applying NLP algorithms to speech data, such as using a sequence to sequence model for speech recognition. WAV2VEC learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task, distinguishing future steps in the data. The BERT model uses a transformer encoder to build text representations, optimizing contrastive loss for future step prediction. After training, the context network's representations are used in the acoustic model instead of log-mel filterbank features. Our approach, vq-wav2vec, utilizes vector quantized representations of audio data through a future time-step prediction task. It involves two convolutional networks for feature extraction and aggregation, along with a quantization module to build discrete representations. The model maps raw speech segments to dense feature representations and then quantizes them into discrete indices for context prediction tasks. The quantization module in vq-wav2vec replaces the original representation with a fixed size codebook for computing one-hot representations. It utilizes Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering for vector quantization, mitigating mode collapse. The Gumbel-Softmax enables selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable way, with a linear layer and ReLU applied to the dense representation. During training, output probabilities are determined by uniform samples, and during inference, the largest index is selected. The Gumbel-Softmax method is used for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable manner. The codebook variable representation is chosen based on Euclidean distance to input features. Gradients for the encoder network are obtained through back-propagation. The final loss includes terms for future prediction task and moving codebook vectors closer to encoder output. The Gumbel-Softmax method is utilized for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable way, with gradients obtained through back-propagation. The codebook vectors are adjusted to the encoder output using different terms in the loss function. To address mode collapse issues, a strategy of independently quantizing partitions of the feature vector z is proposed, resulting in larger dictionaries and improved downstream performance. The codebook vectors in a VQ-Wav2Vec model can be shared or not shared across groups, with shared variables generally yielding competitive results. Once the model is trained, audio data can be discretized for algorithms like BERT pre-training to improve speech recognition. The BERT model is trained using masked input token prediction on discretized speech tokens. To make the prediction harder, spans of consecutive tokens are masked. The model is pre-trained on Librispeech and evaluated on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal datasets. The model is evaluated on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal datasets using ablations on a clean subset of tokens. The model uses vqwav2vec/wav2vec models with 34 \u00d7 10 6 parameters, consisting of an encoder with 8 layers and an aggregator with 12 layers. The training includes convolution, dropout, group normalization, and ReLU non-linearity in each layer, with skip connections between blocks in the aggregator network. The model uses skip connections between blocks in the aggregator network. Training includes convolution, dropout, group normalization, and ReLU non-linearity in each layer. The batch size is 10, and models are trained on 8 GPUs. Gumbel-Softmax models are used with 2 groups and 320 latents per group. The temperature \u03c4 is linearly annealed from 2 to 0.5. The linear layer projects encoder features into 640 logits. Gumbel-Softmax generates one-hot vectors for each of the 2 groups. The temperature is annealed from 2 to 0.5 over 70% of updates. After training on Librispeech, 13.5k unique codeword combinations are obtained. BERT base models have 12 layers, model dimension 768, and 12 attention heads. Training is done on 128 GPUs with a batch size of 3072 tokens per GPU.

Additionally, vq-wav2vec and BERT achieve a new state of the art in phoneme recognition with a 21% error reduction. Preliminary experiments with a Big Transformer on vq-wav2vec Gumbel-Softmax discretized speech show promising results. In the experiment, vq-wav2vec is evaluated on the Librispeech dev/test sets with a 4k BPE output vocabulary. Results show promising performance, although not as good as the state of the art due to the lack of data augmentation. Different models with varying numbers of groups and variables are trained to measure compression and accuracy on TIMIT phoneme recognition. The tradeoff between bitrate and accuracy is reported, with experiments conducted using k-means and different group sizes. The quantization module is placed after the aggregator module, and models are trained on the 100h clean Librispeech subset. Various lossy compression algorithms are considered as baselines for comparison.
