    "content": "The HIPAA health insurance provisions aim to ensure continuity of coverage for individuals and small employers, facilitate plan switching, and prevent denial of coverage based on preexisting conditions. Reforms include portability, limiting waiting times for preexisting conditions, guaranteed issue and renewal, non-discrimination based on health status, and affordability measures such as increased tax deductions for health insurance. The HIPAA Act includes provisions for non-discrimination, special enrollment periods, affordability measures, tax incentives for health insurance premiums, MSAs with high deductible plans, long-term care insurance incentives, administrative simplification, and privacy provisions. Additional federal protections require minimum hospital stays for newborn delivery, mental health services coverage, mastectomy reconstructive surgery coverage, and changes to premium deductions for the self-employed. The HIPAA Act includes provisions for non-discrimination, special enrollment periods, affordability measures, tax incentives for health insurance premiums, MSAs with high deductible plans, long-term care insurance incentives, administrative simplification, and privacy provisions. It also requires plans covering mastectomy to include reconstructive surgery. The act aims to help insured Americans with preexisting conditions and those who have been denied insurance due to their health status. However, it does not address the issue of the uninsured. The HIPAA Act does not require employers to offer or pay for health insurance for their employees, family coverage, or cover part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees. However, employers sponsoring a group health plan must comply with certain requirements, including restrictions on preexisting condition limitations and discrimination based on health status. HIPAA's \"portability\" protection allows individuals to use evidence of creditable coverage to reduce or eliminate preexisting condition exclusion periods when switching health plans. This applies when moving between group health plans, from group plans to individual policies, or vice versa. Portability enables individuals to maintain coverage and receive credit for previous insurance when applying for a new plan. Under HIPAA, individuals can use creditable coverage to avoid preexisting condition exclusions when transitioning between health plans. Creditable coverage includes various types of insurance such as group health plans, individual health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and military health care. A preexisting condition is defined as a medical condition for which advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was received within the 6-month period before enrollment. Pregnancy is not considered a preexisting condition under the Act. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits preexisting condition exclusions for newborns, newly adopted children, and newly placed children for adoption if they are covered under creditable coverage within 30 days. Plans must comply with HIPAA portability provisions by July 1, 2005, including exclusions like coverage of pregnancy and treatment for injuries from accidents prior to enrollment. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires plans to comply with portability provisions by July 1, 2005, including exclusions related to accidents prior to enrollment and genetic information as a preexisting condition. Plans cannot impose more than a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period on HIPAA-eligible participants. In the individual market, HIPAA-eligible individuals also have portability protection. HIPAA requires group health plans to meet portability requirements, including a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees. Pregnancy, newborns, and adopted children under 18 cannot be subject to preexisting condition waiting periods. Employers may still impose a waiting period before individuals can join the health plan. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires group health plans to meet portability requirements, including a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees. Individuals should maintain continuous coverage to benefit from the Act, as coverage of a preexisting medical condition may be limited or excluded for up to 12 months for those who enroll in a health plan when first eligible. It is important not to allow insurance coverage to lapse for 63 or more days to qualify for portability protection. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees in group health plans. Continuous coverage is crucial to avoid limitations on coverage for preexisting conditions. Individuals with prior creditable coverage can have their limitation period reduced based on the length of their previous coverage. Once a 12-month limitation period is met, no new limitation may be imposed as long as continuous coverage is maintained. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees in group health plans. Continuous coverage is crucial to avoid limitations on coverage for preexisting conditions. Individuals with prior creditable coverage can have their limitation period reduced based on the length of their previous coverage. Certification of creditable coverage is required to waive preexisting condition limitations, with specific guidelines on when and how it should be provided. Late enrollment may result in extended exclusion periods. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees in group health plans. Late enrollment in a group health plan may result in extended exclusion periods. Waiting periods before health insurance benefits become available can be determined by employers and health insurance issuers, but must be applied uniformly without regard to health status. Days in a waiting period are not considered when determining a break in coverage of 63 days or more. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period for new enrollees in group health plans. Waiting periods before health insurance benefits become available can be determined by employers and health insurance issuers, but must be applied uniformly without regard to health status. When an individual changes plans, the new benefit package may cover some benefits that were not covered under the previous plan, and the law allows the new plan or issuer some discretion in coverage. When an individual changes plans, the new benefit package may cover additional benefits not included in the prior plan. Plans and issuers have discretion in applying prior creditable coverage to these new benefits. They can choose to include all periods of coverage from qualified sources or examine prior coverage on a benefit-specific basis. Categories of benefits that may be considered separately include mental health, substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, dental care, and vision care. If a prior plan did not cover a specific benefit and the new plan does, the new plan may exclude coverage of that benefit for up to 12 months. Plans or issuers must disclose this practice at enrollment and apply it uniformly. HIPAA guarantees the availability of a plan and prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions for certain eligible individuals moving from group health insurance to the individual market. States can choose to enforce HIPAA individual market guarantees or establish an alternative mechanism. In states using the federal fallback approach, health insurance issuers must offer coverage to all eligible individuals without limitations on preexisting conditions. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guarantees coverage for eligible individuals moving from group health insurance to the individual market, prohibiting limitations on preexisting conditions. Issuers must offer access to coverage in various ways, including through popular insurance policies or different coverage levels. Exceptions can be made if financial or provider capacity would be impaired, but must be applied uniformly without considering the health status of applicants. Eligible individuals must have creditable health insurance. HIPAA guarantees coverage for eligible individuals transitioning from group health insurance to the individual market, ensuring no limitations on preexisting conditions. To qualify, individuals must have continuous creditable health insurance for 18 months, exhausted COBRA coverage, and no breaks in coverage over 63 days. Portability and availability protections only apply to those with recent coverage from employer-based, governmental, or church plans. Individuals not meeting these criteria may be protected by state laws. ERISA defines governmental plans as those established by the US government, state governments, or political subdivisions. However, individuals with coverage from military, college-sponsored plans, and certain government agencies are not eligible for federal portability and availability protections. State laws may offer similar protections, requiring a choice of health insurance without preexisting condition restrictions. The Act's group-to-individual portability provisions require comprehensive health insurance coverage in the individual market or a standard option under state health insurance laws. States may implement mechanisms like NAIC Model Acts, high-risk pools, or other risk spreading approaches. Examples include health insurance coverage pools, guaranteed issue plans, and open enrollment. Table 1 shows how each state has implemented these provisions. As of December 2003, the District of Columbia and 10 states utilize the federal fallback mechanism for the Act's group-to-individual portability provisions. Missouri is the only state where CMS enforces these standards. States use high-risk pools or a combination of mechanisms for portability. Individuals can contact the state's department of insurance for more information on health insurance regulation. The Act provides two special enrollment periods for obtaining group coverage after losing group health insurance. The special enrollment periods for obtaining group coverage after losing group health insurance require certain conditions to be met, such as having previous coverage under a COBRA continuation provision or other terminated coverage due to reasons like legal separation, divorce, death, or termination of employment. A written statement may be required if declining coverage was due to being covered under another health insurance plan. The special enrollment period allows individuals to enroll in group health coverage after losing eligibility due to reasons like legal separation, divorce, death, or termination of employment. Dependent beneficiaries can also enroll due to events like marriage, birth, adoption, or placement of adoption. Enrollment must be requested within 30 days of the qualifying event. The special enrollment period allows individuals to enroll in group health coverage after losing eligibility due to events like legal separation, divorce, death, or termination of employment. Dependent beneficiaries can also enroll due to events like marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Coverage is effective immediately for birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, and no later than the first day of the month after the request for enrollment for marriage. The Act prohibits discrimination based on health status-related factors for enrollment, re-enrollment, and premium charges within group health plans. The Act prohibits discrimination in group health plans based on health status-related factors, including denying enrollment or charging differential premiums. The Department of Labor defined the nondiscrimination provisions of HIPAA broadly, extending protections to individuals participating in high-risk activities. These protections cover enrollment policies and premiums, but not the benefits covered. The HIPAA Act protects individuals in high-risk activities by extending protections to enrollment policies and premiums. However, it does not require coverage for injuries related to these activities. Employers are not mandated to offer coverage to spouses or children under group health plans, but if they do, non-discrimination protections apply. Premium amounts are not restricted, and employers can offer discounts for health promotion programs. The HIPAA Act allows employers to offer premium discounts for health promotion programs but prohibits charging higher premiums based on health factors. It also requires insurers to accept small employers regardless of health status, known as \"guaranteed issue.\" The HIPAA Act requires health insurance issuers to provide guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability for employer groups, regardless of health status or use of services. Exceptions are provided for network plans exceeding capacity limits or if employees do not reside in the plan's area. Large employer groups with over 50 employees are not protected unless required by state law. The Act mandates reporting on access to health insurance in the large group market every three years. The HIPAA Act mandates guaranteed issue and renewability for employer groups, with exceptions for non-payment of premiums or fraud. Insurers can charge unlimited amounts. Congress has added specific benefits twice, such as mental health parity and minimum hospital stays for newborn delivery. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act requires coverage for mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, which mandates coverage for reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. Private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses compared to other illnesses, with limitations on hospital days and office visits, and increased cost sharing. Some states have passed full-parity laws for mental health coverage, but these laws do not apply to self-insured plans due to ERISA exemptions. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) amended ERISA and the Public Health Service Act to establish federal standards for mental health coverage in employer-sponsored plans. It requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage, allowing plans to impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing. The MHPA has limitations, exempts small employers, and allows exemptions for increased claims costs. The MHPA is authorized through December 31, 2005, and there were unsuccessful attempts to amend and expand it in the 107th Congress. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) is currently authorized through December 31, 2005. The 107th Congress attempted to pass legislation (S. 543) to expand the MHPA by requiring full-parity coverage for mental health benefits. This legislation is supported by advocates for the mentally ill and bipartisan lawmakers, but opposed by employers and health insurance organizations due to concerns about increased healthcare costs. Additionally, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, part of P.L. 104-204, mandates minimum hospital stays for childbirth. Title IX of the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act requires group plans and health insurance issuers to cover prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery for mastectomies. Employers can exclude specific illnesses from health benefit plans, but many states have laws mandating certain benefits in insurance products. Small employers may have limited discretion in choosing coverage due to insurance companies offering set products. Self-funded plans under ERISA allow employers to craft their own benefits. Self-funded plans under ERISA allow employers to craft their own benefits, exempt from state laws. HIPAA and its amendments place specific coverage requirements on these plans. Association plans must comply with various requirements, such as not dropping coverage for medical service use. The Act requires association plans to provide creditable coverage and renew coverage, with states able to impose their own requirements. HIPAA ensures that state laws do not hinder consumer protections, but certain provisions override state laws, such as restrictions on preexisting medical condition limitation periods. Exceptions exist for state laws that offer greater portability, like defining a preexisting condition as less than 6 months prior to coverage. The Act does not restrict premium amounts, but some states may limit insurance premiums in the individual market. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury enforce the Act jointly. State laws that allow preexisting condition limitation periods longer than 12 months would be overridden by the Act. The FEHBP program complies with HIPAA requirements. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury jointly enforce the Act, with specific responsibilities for enforcing requirements on employer plans, group health plans, and health insurance issuers. States have primary responsibility for enforcing HIPAA standards, but DHHS steps in if states do not pass enabling legislation. Only Missouri had not enacted such legislation as of 2001. As of 2001, Missouri was the only state that had not enacted legislation to enforce HIPAA standards. Noncompliant group health plans under ERISA may face civil penalties, and participants can sue to recover benefits. The Secretary of Labor investigates compliance, and fines can be imposed for violations. States enforce requirements on issuers, with Missouri's HHS Secretary responsible for enforcement. The HHS Secretary can fine entities for noncompliance and create regulations for coverage issuers. The table lists regulations for HIPAA's insurance provisions, including COBRA continuation coverage and eligibility for guaranteed availability and portability in the individual market. Moving from COBRA to a new health plan without a coverage lapse of 63 days allows coverage of preexisting conditions under the new plan. Individuals must exhaust COBRA or other continuation coverage before accessing the individual market. The Act clarifies COBRA continuation coverage rules, including eligibility for disabled beneficiaries and newborn or adopted children. Insurers in the individual market can charge rates allowed by state law without limitation. Terminating COBRA is possible if a beneficiary joins a group health plan without exclusions or limitations. Under the Act, beneficiaries can join a group health plan without exclusions or limitations affecting them or their beneficiaries. The Act also allows individuals to use funds from their Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) to pay COBRA premiums without penalty. Additionally, HIPAA includes provisions for electronic transmission of health care information to streamline administrative operations in the healthcare system. HIPAA's Administrative Simplification Compliance Act of 2001 aimed to streamline health care administrative operations by setting electronic transaction and security standards. Providers and health plans were required to comply with these standards by specific deadlines to protect health information. Congress also mandated the development of unique health identifiers for patients, employers, and providers, with standards issued for employer and provider identifiers. The patient identifier standard development has been delayed by Congress annually since FY1999. In each fiscal year since FY1999, Congress has prevented CMS from developing a standard for the unique patient identifier by inserting language in the agency's annual appropriations bill. Patients are concerned about the privacy of their medical information and fear unauthorized access. Lawmakers included a timetable in HIPAA to develop standards for protecting health information privacy. HIPAA required Congress to enact health privacy legislation by August 21, 1999, but the Secretary developed a privacy rule when Congress missed the deadline. The final rule was issued on December 28, 2000, with modifications on August 14, 2002. Medical savings accounts (MSAs) were authorized under HIPAA for unreimbursed medical expenses. MSAs, now called Archer MSAs, are personal savings accounts for healthcare costs not covered by insurance. Medical savings accounts (MSAs), now known as Archer MSAs, can be established by taxpayers with qualifying high deductible insurance. Employer contributions to MSAs are tax-free, while individual contributions are deductible. MSAs are held by financial institutions and earnings are tax-exempt. Withdrawals for medical expenses are untaxed, but non-qualified distributions are subject to penalties. HIPAA set a deadline for establishing accounts and limited the total number allowed. IRS estimated 78,913 MSA returns filed for tax year 2001. The IRS estimated 78,913 MSA returns filed for tax year 2001, with 20,592 new accounts established in the first six months of 2002. Amendments extended the deadline for new accounts to December 31, 2003. Current MSA owners can maintain their accounts and make contributions if they have qualifying high-deductible insurance. MSA owners can now have HSAs, and their MSA balances can be rolled over. For more information on MSAs and HSAs, refer to CRS reports. HIPAA increased the portion of premiums that self-employed taxpayers may deduct from income for federal taxes. The deduction percentages were increased over the years, reaching 100% in 2003. Payments for personal injury or sickness through an arrangement like health insurance are exempt from taxation. Payments from self-insured plans for self-employed individuals are treated like payments from commercial insurance. HIPAA established new rules regarding the tax treatment of long-term care insurance and expenses, effective January 1, 1997. Qualified long-term care insurance is treated as accident and health insurance, and benefits are excluded from gross income. Employer contributions to the cost of qualified long-term care insurance premiums are also excluded from the gross income of the employee. Unreimbursed long-term care expenses are allowed as itemized deductions to the extent they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Unreimbursed long-term care expenses can be deducted if they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Long-term care insurance premiums are considered as deductible expenses, with age-adjusted limits ranging from $270 to $3,400. Self-employed individuals can include these premiums in their health insurance deduction. Qualified long-term care insurance must meet specific criteria to be eligible for deductions. Qualified long-term care insurance must meet specific criteria to be eligible for deductions, such as being issued before January 1, 1997, meeting state requirements at the time of issuance, and providing necessary services prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner for a chronically ill individual. Services provided by a spouse or relative without a professional license are not eligible for favorable tax treatment. Chronically ill individuals are defined as those unable to perform at least two daily activities without substantial assistance. HIPAA requires a licensed health practitioner to certify that a person meets specific criteria to be considered chronically ill, including the inability to perform daily activities without assistance. Accelerated death benefits and viatical settlements received by terminally or chronically ill individuals are excluded from gross income. Amounts received from a viatical settlement provider for the sale of a life insurance contract on a terminally or chronically ill individual are excluded from gross income. Exclusions do not apply to amounts paid to persons with an insurable interest for business reasons. Terminally ill individuals are certified by a physician as having an illness expected to result in death within 24 months. Chronically ill individuals are defined similarly to long-term care criteria. The exclusion of accelerated death benefits is limited to actual long-term care costs not covered by insurance. Benefits paid on a per diem basis are limited to $240 a day or the costs of long-term care services. Expenses reimbursable under Medicare are not covered by these contracts. Contracts for long-term care services must not cover expenses reimbursable under Medicare. Consumer protection provisions specified in the tax code apply, except for standards for chronically ill individuals set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the state. HIPAA exempted state-sponsored organizations providing insurance to high-risk individuals from federal income tax. Health insurance providers organized under state laws for not-for-profit purposes can deduct 25% of claims and expenses. HIPAA expanded tax benefits for not-for-profit health insurance organizations, allowing them to deduct 25% of claims and expenses. It also eliminated the 10% early withdrawal penalty for IRA distributions used for medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of income, and for health insurance premiums after job loss with unemployment compensation. Additionally, HIPAA mandated inclusion of organ donor info in tax refund mailings and authorized tax-advantaged MSAs starting in 1997."
