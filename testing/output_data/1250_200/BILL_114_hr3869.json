The national cybersecurity and communications integration center must protect sensitive information, maintain confidentiality of cyber threat indicators, and comply with legal and privacy protections. Congressional oversight is required to assess the effectiveness of these activities within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. The national cybersecurity and communications integration center seeks feedback from State and local governments on information security effectiveness. The House of Representatives passed the information required under this subsection on December 10, 2015. Clerk: KAREN L. HAAS."
