Pollination services are crucial for agricultural production, valued globally at over $125 billion and $20-30 billion annually in the United States. One-third of North American food relies on honey bee pollination, including 95 varieties of fruits. Colony collapse disorder incidents have been increasing, with beekeepers losing entire operations. Beekeepers in the US lost 45.1% of colonies during the winter of 2012-2013. Current honey bee colony survivorship is too low to meet US agricultural pollination demands. The use of neonicotinoid insecticides is linked to the rapid decline of pollinators. Scientists have linked systemic neonicotinoid insecticides to the decline of pollinators and their health. These insecticides cause sublethal effects like impaired foraging and weakened immunity. Studies show acute lethal effects from neonicotinoid application, with a single corn kernel coated enough to kill a songbird. Neonicotinoids were responsible for killing over 50,000 bumblebees and prompted the EU to suspend their use on crops due to unacceptable hazards to bees. SEC. 3. URGENT REGULATORY RESPONSE FOR HONEY BEE AND POLLINATOR PROTECTION. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend the registration of certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee attractive plants until it is determined that they will not harm pollinators. This determination will be based on scientific evidence and field studies evaluating their effects on pollinators. The Administrator must suspend certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee attractive plants until it is determined they will not harm pollinators. This includes evaluating residue build-up, chronic exposure, and cumulative effects on pollinators. No new registrations for seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee attractive plants can be issued until the Administrator completes the necessary evaluations. The Secretary of the Interior will monitor native bees in coordination with the Administrator. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will monitor the health and population status of native bees, identify causes of unusual bee mortality, and submit annual reports to Congress and the public for the long-term viability of native bees and other pollinators."
