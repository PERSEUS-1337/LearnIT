Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy than in 1986. Merchandise trade now accounts for 25% of GDP, up from 14% in the past. Harbor maintenance is funded by a tax on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. Revenue from the tax goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund, which covers dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. The surplus of tax receipts over expenditures reduces the federal budget deficit. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) surplus reduces the federal budget deficit. Around half of the annual HMT collected is spent on harbor maintenance. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013. In FY2014, the HMTF expects $2.05 billion in income. Proposed bills aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance and prevent accumulation of funds in the trust account. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee proposed increasing HMTF expenditures to allocate 80% of the prior fiscal year's HMT collections for harbor maintenance. This could potentially reduce funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Congress may need to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to compensate for the increased HMTF funding, which would require less funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. The Congress defined \"harbors\" as capable of transporting commercial cargo by vessels, while \"inland harbors\" are used for commercial vessels and cargo on inland waters. Inland harbors must currently handle cargo, while coastal or Great Lakes harbors only need to be capable of handling cargo. The definitions, unchanged since 1986, exclude ferries and fresh-caught fish. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Harbor projects are categorized as \"single-purpose\" or \"multi-purpose\" projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1 million and 10 million tons of cargo, accounted for 9% of maritime commerce and received 19% of funding. In FY2013, \"moderate use\" ports received 19% of HMTF spending, with 7% of \"low use\" ports also having federally funded O&M projects planned. This allocation of funds has been a point of debate between S. 601 and H.R. 3080, with concerns over the limited federal funding for low and moderate-use harbors impacting local economies. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending has been a point of debate between S. 601 and H.R. 3080. H.R. 3080 directs the Corps not to allocate funds solely based on tonnage, while S. 601 seems to favor large commercial cargo ports. Data shows that 61% of waterways eligible for HMTF funds carried no cargo from FY2005 to FY2009, with almost 75% handling little to no cargo. The Administration's budget requests have directed the majority of HMTF spending to high-use harbors based on cargo volume, rather than cargo value. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is currently allocated based on cargo volume rather than cargo value, favoring ports that handle tankers and bulk ships. This allocation tends to concentrate funding on high-use ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland. In FY2011, high-use ports received only half of the requested funds, moderate-use ports received 30%, and low-use harbors received 10%. The total amount requested for low-use harbors was $766 million. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is currently allocated based on cargo volume, favoring high-use ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland. In FY2011, high-use ports received half of the requested funds, moderate-use ports received 30%, and low-use harbors received 10%. The total amount requested for low-use harbors was $766 million, nearly approaching the amount requested for the busiest harbors. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds requested, while economically significant ports received only half. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, leading to partial investments across many facilities. Ship traffic is more concentrated at the top 35 ports, with the top 10 ports accounting for 90% of ship traffic. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports and the top 10 ports accounting for 60% of commercial ship calls. The Corps may justify concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors, but this could hinder the development of moderate-use ports and impact ports with fishing and recreational vessel traffic. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually. A 2012 study found that the Corps is authorized to maintain over 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintains only 360. There is uncertainty about whether the Corps is maintaining fewer projects than before, and a lack of systematic evaluation for continued federal investment in harbor projects has led to passive stewardship of resources. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and ensuring their economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago when waterways were the primary mode of transportation. Today, these small harbors are mainly used for pleasure boats, but the Corps still maintains them using funds from a cargo tax. There is a need for explicit requirements and procedures to evaluate the economic viability of harbor projects regularly. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining protected channels and small harbors primarily used by pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. Recent initiatives prioritize harbor maintenance based on commercial importance, using a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" for objective fund allocation. Budget guidance includes using metrics like tonnage and cost per ton for project allocation. The Corps uses objective criteria to allocate O&M funds for Corps projects, including tonnage and cost per ton for commercial navigation. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. Concerns about lack of criteria raised in a 2003 study remain, with uncertainty on how many harbor navigation projects would qualify for priority funding. GAO recommended creating an advisory committee for input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee exists. Congress is concerned that the Corps' project prioritization criteria are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment. The GAO report highlighted concerns that the Corps' project prioritization criteria are not transparent and may not achieve the highest return on investment. The Corps' budget process emphasizes anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, but actual performance is considered for completed projects in the Operation and Maintenance program. Opportunity cost, a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently, is not specifically mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of considering opportunity cost in harbor maintenance nearly half a century ago. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, making an average over several years a better indicator. The Corps only maintains federally designated channels, using the HMTF to cover 100% of the federal cost for harbors up to 45 feet deep. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with local cost-sharing only for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction costs are not covered by the HMTF and are funded from general government revenues, with federal shares ranging from 40% to 80% based on harbor depth. Berths and private side channels are the responsibility of port authorities or terminal owners. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose expanding the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging berths and removing contaminated sediments at ports. This would benefit ports generating more HMT revenue than they receive, such as Los Angeles and Long Beach. The current law restricts the use of HMTF money for dredging berths and private side channels, leading to objections from deep ports. The proposed changes aim to allow ports to utilize HMTF funds for necessary maintenance and potentially return excess funds to shippers. In 2011, New York harbor generated $132 million, about 15% of total HMT collections. Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors generated a quarter of total HMT collections. The top 15 harbors collect over 75% of total HMT revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. Critical harbors of refuge receive priority for O&M funds, along with harbors supporting Coast Guard stations and channels used by passenger ferries. The Corps prioritizes maintenance funding for critical harbors of refuge and subsistence harbors, with additional funding allocated by House and Senate Appropriations Committees for small, remote, or subsistence harbors. Committees urge the Corps to revise criteria for navigation maintenance projects to ensure equitable allocation of funds. The criteria for determining navigation maintenance project funding includes economic impact on local and regional economies, especially those important for national defense or public safety. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, shifting responsibility to state and local governments. President Reagan had also suggested terminating funding for harbors with high federal maintenance costs. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration to save $150 million in annual federal harbor maintenance expenditures. The debate over maintaining harbors with little or no commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation. In 1954, the House Committee on Appropriations endorsed this policy, stating that the federal government has no obligation to maintain economically obsolete waterways. The 1956 audit by the General Accounting Office found that the Corps was maintaining waterways predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific policies for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. 11 coastal navigation projects were identified as of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending in 2011. Reclassification of the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida as a flood-control project was recommended due to negligible navigation benefit. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended by GAO to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to minimal navigation benefits, making it ineligible for HMTF expenditures. Despite not being reclassified, it received about $30 million from FY1999 to FY2008. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008 but has seen no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have focused O&M expenses on flood risk mitigation rather than navigation. Recreational harbors have a positive economic impact, with studies showing significant spending and job creation by recreational boaters. Recreational boating supports job creation and economic impact, with studies showing significant spending by boaters. Boaters pay federal fuel taxes for various boating-related programs and facilities. Some in the industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for dredging recreational harbors. The Corps is exploring local financing options for harbor maintenance. However, key information on current HMTF expenditures is not publicly available. The Corps provides reports on HMTF expenditures, harbor usage data, and channel conditions. However, there are discrepancies in data mapping and a lack of comparison between shipping channels' dimensions and modern vessel needs. Economic losses from deficiencies are also not estimated. The Corps does not estimate economic losses from deficiencies in channels or the benefits of correcting them. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program focuses on developing economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program aims to invest tax dollars wisely in navigation projects that provide long-term value. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions. The Corps was requested by Congress to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions, but this information was not included in the FY2014 budget request. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) payment for a 40-foot shipping container to be $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant when measured against typical freight charges. Shipping costs for a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest are around $4,000, with an average container value of $117,606 resulting in an HMT of $147. Ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts traffic. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) of $147 for a 40-foot container raises shipping costs by about 4%. Ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts inbound cargo to ports across the border. A 2012 FMC study found that factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. If the HMT was removed, shippers could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee. The FMC concluded that Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) with a maritime goods movement user fee. The HMT may discourage coastal feeder service, leading to uncollected taxes from domestic waterborne shippers. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is not refundable like import duties under CBP's duty drawback program, impacting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product, but they do pay the HMT on materials and inputs transported through ports. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are concerned about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being sufficient for global marketplace competitiveness. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce are focusing on improving the nation's marine transportation system to enhance national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs and investment decisions, with a key battleground being the efficiency of supply chain management. The battleground for corporate competitiveness now revolves around the speed and efficiency of supply chain management. Policymakers, management leadership, and academicians must ensure that supply chains and transportation infrastructure align with strategic priorities. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Corps signed a memorandum in 2012 to improve transportation infrastructure investments. President Obama initiated a federal permitting expedite for construction projects at five harbors in response to the Panama Canal expansion. A Task Force on Ports was established in the FY2013 Budget to provide a strategic framework for maritime stakeholders. A Task Force on Ports was established by officials from five departments and five White House offices to address calls for a strategic framework for federal investments in response to maritime stakeholders' needs."
