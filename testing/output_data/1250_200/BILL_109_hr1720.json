    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful bacteria and viruses. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various illnesses, resulting in significant economic losses. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring for early detection. Economic losses from swimming-related illnesses amount to $28 billion annually. Sewer systems often lack monitoring and reporting of overflows, putting millions at risk of illness. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows threatening public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act defines \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages. Monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are required. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect public health. Owners must alert the public within 24 hours of an overflow and notify health authorities and affected entities immediately. Publicly owned treatment works must notify public health authorities and affected entities immediately of any sanitary sewer overflow that endangers human health. They must provide oral or electronic reports within 24 hours and a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause, along with steps taken to address it. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or the State, including details of each incident such as wastewater released, overflow duration, location, response actions, and mitigation efforts. The State must report annually to the EPA on sanitary sewer overflows, detailing the incidents and actions taken to clean up and prevent further overflows. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nIncreases funding to $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012 under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
