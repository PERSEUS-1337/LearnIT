    "content": "The \"Pay Stub Disclosure Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings related to pay stub disclosure. The lack of Federal requirement for pay stubs hinders wage violation identification. A survey found many low-wage workers underpaid or not receiving overtime. Some employers make pay calculation difficult. Existing laws lack effective remedies for pay record violations. The Department of Labor regulations mandate employers to keep records of employees' pay, but the lack of remedies undermines this requirement. In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., the Supreme Court ruled that if an employer fails to maintain required records under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the burden shifts to the employer to disprove the employee's evidence of work hours and compensation. However, many courts have failed to shift this burden, giving equal weight to employer testimony and employee evidence. SEC. 3. PAY STUB REQUIREMENTS. Disclosure Requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 have been amended to include initial disclosure to non-exempt employees within 15 days of hiring or any changes in pay information. This disclosure must include details such as rate of pay, method of payment, employer's name, business names, and contact information. The employer must provide specific disclosures in each pay stub to non-exempt employees, including pay period covered, employee's name and last four digits of SSN, total hours worked, gross and net wages for hourly employees, salary amount for salaried employees. The pay stub must also include details such as salary paid, piece-rate units earned, commission amount, overtime hours worked, and additional compensation or benefits. The pay stub should disclose details like salary, piece-rate units earned, commission, overtime hours, additional compensation, benefits, allowances, and deductions. The pay stub should disclose salary, piece-rate units earned, commission, overtime hours, additional compensation, benefits, allowances, and reimbursements for meals, clothing, lodging, or other items provided by the employer. It must be itemized and not labeled as 'miscellaneous'. The pay stub should be provided to the employee each pay period either as a separate document or accompanying their pay. The pay stub must be provided to an employee each pay period, either as a separate document, a detachable part of a paycheck, or electronically if the employee receives pay through electronic deposit. Employers must keep records of pay stub information for three years and provide copies of records upon employee request within 21 days. Employers must provide employees with a pay stub each pay period, either as a separate document, a detachable part of a paycheck, or electronically. Records of pay stub information must be kept for three years and provided to employees upon request within 21 days. Additionally, employers must provide a notice to each employee within 15 days of hire, outlining the employee's right to receive a pay stub, contact information for the Department of Labor, and any additional information required by the Secretary. For employees hired before the enactment of the Pay Stub Disclosure Act, this notice must be provided within 15 days of the Act's effective date. The employer must provide a notice within 15 days of the Pay Stub Disclosure Act's effective date. The section heading of section 11 is amended to include \"pay stub disclosures.\" SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. In the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, amendments are made to increase employer liability for violations of certain sections. Employers who violate specific sections shall be liable to affected employees for monetary penalties. Additionally, employers failing to maintain required records or allow employee access to records will face consequences. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 amendments increase employer liability for violations. Employers who fail to keep records or allow employee access may face penalties. The Secretary has the authority to adjust penalties for inflation. In cases of insufficient records, employee evidence can create a presumption of accuracy. SEC. 5 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to define a pay stub as a paper itemizing wages and deductions. SEC. 6 addresses regulations and technical assistance. SEC. 6 of the Act requires the Secretary of Labor to establish regulations within a year of enactment, including identifying similar state and local laws for compliance. The Secretary will also provide guidance on compliance and offer technical assistance to achieve and maintain compliance. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 6 months after final regulations are issued by the Secretary of Labor, but no later than 18 months after the Act's enactment."
