    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, mandatory livestock market reporting, and regulations. The findings of the \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" highlight the adverse effects of changes in marketing relationships between swine producers and meat packers on swine prices. The concentration of the meat packing industry, increased imports of live swine, and a swine market price crisis in 1998 are key factors affecting slaughter capacity and swine prices in the United States. In 1998, there was an eight percent decrease in packer slaughter capacity and a 37 percent increase in Canadian swine imports to the United States. The fourth quarter of 1998 saw the lowest live swine prices in the spot market for the 20th century. Swine producers experienced a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment and received only $0.22 of the consumer pork dollar, the first time they received less than 30 percent. Despite stable retail prices, consumption of pork products remained steady. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses incurred in 1998 due to economic factors and government failures in pursuing foreign trade opportunities. Despite stable retail prices, consumption of pork products increased by seven percent in 1998, making it the only meat protein with a net per capita consumption increase. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"swine,\" \"swine producer,\" \"crisis period,\" \"packer,\" \"feeder pig,\" \"swine operation,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers affiliated with publicly owned packers are ineligible. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers through an application process outlined in the Act. The payment amounts and limitations for financial assistance to swine producers will be outlined in the Act. Financial assistance under the Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. The assistance amount per swine will not exceed $25 for slaughter-weight swine and $9 for feeder pigs, based on regulations issued by the Secretary. Payments will be calculated based on the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered during the crisis period. Payments to swine producers during the crisis period are calculated by adding $25 for slaughter-weight swine and $9 for feeder pigs, deducting payments received in another program. Payment limitations are set at $50,000 per swine operation. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained under various agricultural programs such as the Agricultural Market Transition Act, crop insurance indemnities, and emergency loans. Payments under the Small Hog Operation Program are also included. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program of the Department of Agriculture shall be deducted from payments made under this Act. SEC. 7. Emergency requirement designated by Congress for funds to be used by the Secretary through the Commodity Credit Corporation. SEC. 8. Mandatory livestock market reporting added to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like livestock, livestock product, and packer. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, and swine, while livestock product refers to products derived from livestock. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter, processing livestock products, or marketing them in commerce. Prices, volume, and terms of sale encompass various factors like base price, premiums, discounts, and quality characteristics. The Secretary of Agriculture is defined as the Secretary. Mandatory reporting is required for packers engaged in buying, manufacturing, or marketing livestock products in the United States. Packers must report required information to the Secretary as specified. The Secretary requires packers to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock products. Packers must report separately for domestic and imported products and comply by the next business day. Noncompliance is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify the accuracy of the information provided. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation if a packer is believed to be violating reporting requirements. Factors considered for the penalty include the seriousness of the offense, the size of the business, and the impact on the packer's ability to operate. The Secretary may refer unpaid civil penalties to the Attorney General for recovery in court if a packer fails to pay. The Secretary encourages voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting. Information received will be made available to the public in a timely manner. The disclosure of information under limitations ensures the confidentiality of parties involved in transactions and packers submitting reports. The reporting requirement established by subsection (b) will expire after three years. Repeal of section 1127(a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to address various matters related to the implementation, including preventing misrepresentations in claims for benefits and appeals processes. The regulations will be issued without following certain provisions related to notice and comment requirements and the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Secretary must issue regulations promptly after the Act's enactment to address implementation matters, using authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act and section 808(2) of title 5, United States Code."
