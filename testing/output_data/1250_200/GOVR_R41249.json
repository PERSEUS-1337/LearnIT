    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws aim to provide equal coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Prior to the ACA, federal mental health parity law employed a mandated offering parity approach, which did not mandate coverage of specific mental health services but required parity coverage for those that were covered. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements, without explicitly mandating coverage at the federal level. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by extending them to specific financing arrangements, without directly mandating coverage. Two major laws, MHPA and MHPAEA, establish federal mental health parity requirements, including parity in limits and treatment. Insurers must comply with these requirements if they cover both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. Some employers have adjusted benefits in response to MHPAEA, with a small percentage choosing to drop mental health coverage. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by extending them to specific financing arrangements, without directly mandating coverage. MHPA and MHPAEA establish federal mental health parity requirements, including parity in limits and treatment. Some employers have adjusted benefits in response to MHPAEA, with a small percentage choosing to drop mental health coverage. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It mandates that annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage be no less than those for medical and surgical services. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) mandates that annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage be no less than those for medical and surgical services. MHPA, along with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders. MHPAEA also exempts small employers with 2 to 50 employees from federal mental health parity requirements and allows group health plans experiencing a cost increase of at least 1% to be exempt from parity requirements. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders. It amends the small employer exemption and clarifies cost exemption parameters. The federal mental health parity requirements do not apply to the individual market. Medicare beneficiaries must comply with mental health parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various types of plans, including qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It mandates coverage of specified mental health services and requires compliance with parity laws for plans in the individual market. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various plans, including Medicaid benchmark plans. Small employer exemption remains, but QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with parity laws. Medicaid benchmark plans must also comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA did not change parity requirements for CHIP plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various plans, including Medicaid benchmark plans, QHPs, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services, ensuring parity with medical and surgical services. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA required full parity when benefits were offered, but did not include a coverage mandate. The ACA creates a coverage mandate for mental health and substance abuse services broadly. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in various plans, including QHPs, small group, and individual market plans. QHPs must provide essential health benefits, which include mental health and substance use disorder services. Coverage details are determined through the rulemaking process. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in various plans, including QHPs, small group, and individual market plans. Coverage details are determined through the rulemaking process, with the statute requiring coverage within 10 broad categories. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must offer at least the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHB) by January 1, 2014, creating a federal-level requirement for coverage of mental health benefits by a sizable portion of insurers. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in various plans, including QHPs, small group, and individual market plans. States may require additional benefits beyond the EHB, but must cover the cost. Federal mental health parity requirements apply to all QHPs. The federal mental health parity requirements apply to all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) in the same way as they do to health insurance issuers and group health plans. QHPs offered through the Exchanges will be available in both the small group and individual markets, with large group plans having less incentive to participate. Small employers are exempt from these requirements, which may impact plans offered through the Exchange. The federal mental health parity requirements apply to all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) in the same way as they do to health insurance issuers and group health plans. The small employer exemption extends to states where the definition includes self-employed individuals. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends the federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market. This effectively extends these requirements to plans in the individual market, but the small employer exemption remains in place. Based on the amended statutory language, the small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law appears to remain in effect. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with 1 to 100 employees, widening the range of eligible employers. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition of small employer until 2016 for plans offered through an Exchange. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange. Questions may arise regarding compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals in the individual market versus group coverage for single individuals as employers. Additionally, there is a question of whether small employer QHPs might be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, including those offered through managed care plans. Medicaid may be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage. Compliance with federal mental health parity requirements is required for all Medicaid managed care plans offering medical, surgical, mental health, or substance use disorder benefits. ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, focusing on treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. The requirement for Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans to comply with federal mental health parity requirements is unclear, unlike Medicaid managed care plans which must adhere to these requirements. It is uncertain if non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid are also subject to these parity requirements. Deeming plans offering EPSDT services as meeting parity requirements may impact the coverage terms for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations. Existing CHIP provisions may need to be updated to align with ACA changes. Compliance with parity requirements may impact coverage for Medicaid enrollees. The state child health plan must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for both financial requirements and treatment limitations. Offering EPSDT services may satisfy the parity requirement, but it is unclear if it fulfills all federal mental health parity requirements. Compliance with SSA Section 2103(f)(2) is also required for all coverage under SSA Section 2103. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, representing a significant change from pre-ACA federal law. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various health plans, including CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plans. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services, marking a significant change from pre-ACA federal law. Some questions remain about the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange and certain Medicaid non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute includes two parity-related provisions, one with limited reach and another applying requirements to CHIP plans entirely."
