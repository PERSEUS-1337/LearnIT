    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for pesticide registration. It authorized the collection of maintenance fees for EPA review of registrations issued before 1984 and registration service fees for new pesticide applications. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and expanded the fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA) established a fee framework for pesticide registration, with PRIA 2 adding new application categories and adjusting fee amounts. PRIA 3 reauthorized and further amended the framework, setting annual maximum maintenance fees and establishing a cap on aggregate fees collected annually. Failure to pay maintenance fees may result in cancellation of pesticide registration, with fee reductions for small businesses. Section 4 of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act allows EPA to cancel pesticide registrations if maintenance fees are not paid. It provides fee reductions for small businesses and exempts certain public health pesticides from fees. Collected fees go to the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund for EPA's use in evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing, and reevaluating registered pesticides. EPA is required to enhance information systems capabilities with funds allocated from FY2013 to FY2018. The authority to collect registration service fees is phasing out starting at the end of FY2018 unless extended or reauthorized. The authority to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, is set to phase out starting at the end of FY2018. If not extended, EPA's ability to collect fees would be reduced by 70% for FY2019, leading to the expiration of fee collection authority by the end of that fiscal year. Section 33 outlines fee amounts for various registration actions, with provisions for fee reductions for small businesses, exemptions for certain applications, and waivers for specific cases. The authority to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, is set to phase out starting at the end of FY2018. EPA's ability to collect fees would be reduced by 70% for FY2019, leading to the expiration of fee collection authority by the end of that fiscal year. Section 33 prohibits EPA from assessing registration service fees if appropriations for salaries, contracts, and expenses for specified functions of the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs are less than the corresponding FY2012 appropriation. Annual appropriations have authorized EPA to assess registration service fees for FY2013 through FY2018, regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected pesticide registration service fees must be deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. The \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury receives collected pesticide registration service fees, which can be used for various purposes such as application review costs, worker protection activities, grants, and education programs. The Inspector General of EPA conducts annual audits on the fund, and EPA is required to report on its pesticide program activities to Congress. The EPA is required to report on its pesticide program activities to Congress and the Inspector General conducts annual audits on the Pesticide Registration Fund. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, with registration service fees providing a significant portion of funding for pesticide program activities. Maintenance and registration service fees collected annually contribute one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress has initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of maintenance fees. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of maintenance and registration service fees in 2017. Reauthorization legislation was not enacted, but the authority to collect fees was extended for one year through FY2018 appropriations. The House and Senate passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation, with both versions reauthorizing the collection of maintenance fees and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025, respectively. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would increase fees for registrants by 12% and the aggregate for all maintenance fees from $27.8 million to an average of $31.0 million per fiscal year. It directs the EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticide efficacy and good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring. The amendment also revises registration service fee amounts, adds more actions for fee assessment, and revises time frames for EPA review. Additionally, EPA is required to carry out two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception related to agricultural worker protection standards. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 includes revisions to agricultural worker protection standards and certified pesticide applicator standards. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application information and worker safety by October 1, 2021. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, are being reconciled in a conference to address differences. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were passed without roll call votes, indicating broad support for extending the pesticide fee framework. However, disagreements have stalled the current PRIA reauthorization process. The current PRIA reauthorization process is facing delays due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations in the early 2000s."
