    "content": "The Act titled \"Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996\" amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to allow certain individuals to continue participating in defined benefit plans. The Act titled \"Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996\" allows qualified beneficiaries to continue accruing benefits in a defined benefit plan after a qualifying event. This provision ensures that participants do not incur a break in service with the employer for the purpose of benefit accrual. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to continue accruing benefits in a defined benefit plan after a qualifying event. Participation is considered service with the employer under the plan or any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Earnings and forfeitures are not included in determining liability. The period of participation extends until the participant reaches normal retirement age under the plan. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to continue accruing benefits in a defined benefit plan after a qualifying event. The maximum required period is when the participant reaches normal retirement age under the plan. The end of the plan is when the employer stops providing any defined benefit plan to employees. Failure to pay contributions results in benefits ceasing to accrue. Qualified beneficiaries electing continued participation are liable for funding plan obligations. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to receive employer and employee contributions in the same manner as other beneficiaries. Benefit accruals from voluntary employee contributions are only available if they were prior to the qualifying event. Contributions are based on the participant's compensation rate before the event, assuming 1,000 hours of work in a 12-month period. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to continue receiving contributions, limited to 102% of the applicable contribution, with the option for monthly installments. Contributions must not be required before 45 days after the initial election, which must be made within a 90-day election period starting when benefits would otherwise cease. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to continue receiving contributions on behalf of other beneficiaries who would cease to be beneficiaries under the plan. This excludes defined benefit plans with fewer than 20 employees and defines terms like applicable contribution and qualified beneficiary. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 defines terms like qualified beneficiary and qualifying event, which allows beneficiaries to continue receiving contributions in certain circumstances such as termination of employment or death of the participant. The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 defines terms for beneficiaries to continue receiving contributions in specific situations. The Act applies to plan years starting on or after July 1, 1996, with special rules for defined benefit plans under collective bargaining agreements."
