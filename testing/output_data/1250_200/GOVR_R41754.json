    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account, supporting neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. The Community Development Fund provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities. Grants are allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund, representing 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority. This proposal would increase funding by 4.5% or $135 million. The budget proposal for the Community Development Fund in FY2013 would increase total funding by 4.5% or $135 million. This increase would reinstate funding for the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative and transfer funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. Specifically, $100 million is requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, and funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program would be transferred to the CDF account. Funding for CDBG formula grants would remain unchanged from FY2012, with a request of $2.948.1 billion for FY2013. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposes $2.059 billion for CDBG entitlement communities, $882 million for CDBG state administered program, $7 million for insular areas, and $60 million for Indian tribes. Additionally, $100 million is requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which includes funding for Regional Integrated Planning Grants to support sustainable community development efforts in collaboration with DOT, EPA, and other federal agencies. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposes $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, including grants for metropolitan-wide planning in collaboration with DOT, EPA, and other agencies. Community Challenge Grants of $46 million will be awarded to 50 communities for sustainable growth initiatives. $8 million will fund research on housing-transportation integration, with $3 million for technical support. The Administration is requesting $3 million for technical support in developing a residential energy modeling system and common energy standards. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development activities, housing, and infrastructure projects. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013 to help finance job creation activities. The proposal includes charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed increasing funding for CDBG formula grants in FY2013, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $3.210 billion for CDF activities, including $3.100 billion for CDBG grants. The bill also supports funding for Indian tribes and SCI activities, allocating $50 million for SCI and requiring $12.5 million to be allocated to communities with populations under 500,000. The bill allocates $12.5 million for SCI in communities with populations under 500,000 and supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The Senate committee recommends funding Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program to a different account. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $3.404 billion for CDF activities, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. H.R. 5972 recommends funding for various community development programs, including $60 million for Indian tribes and $6 million for loan subsidies. The bill does not support converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure and does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities. The program is noted as unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. The House bill H.R. 5972 recommends funding for community development programs, including $244 million for Section 4 activities. During floor debate, amendments proposing funding reductions or eliminations were defeated. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress aimed to reduce federal spending while supporting private sector job creation to address high unemployment and a struggling economy. Amendments to eliminate funding for the Section 108 loan guarantee program and increase funds for demolition activities were defeated. The Chair ruled that one amendment sought to change existing law, constituting legislation in an appropriation bill. During the FY2012 budget debate, the Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for certain programs, and transferring others to new accounts. The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 levels. The Obama Administration proposed a funding level of $3.804 billion for programs funded under the CDF account in FY2012, which was a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 levels but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration also requested increases in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities, as well as grants to insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed a $150 million appropriation for Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) programs. This funding would support three components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants ($100 million), Community Challenge Grants ($40 million), and Housing-Transportation Integration Research ($10 million). The Administration opposed earmarking funds for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $10 million for Housing-Transportation Integration Research to evaluate benefits and trade-offs. The budget also suggested doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million and implementing a fee-based assessment for borrowers. Congress rejected these proposals. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011, recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants. The draft bill did not eliminate funding for the CDBG program but suggested that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for community development activities for better transparency and accountability. The draft bill recommended shifting funding priorities for CDF activities, including reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes and rejecting the proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees. It also suggested lowering the ceiling on administrative expenses for CDBG grantees from 20% to 10% of their allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing CDF funding to $3.0 billion for FY2012, with $2.851 billion allocated for CDBG formula funding. This would result in a 13.7% reduction in CDBG formula grant funding compared to FY2011 levels. Additionally, $90 million was proposed for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which was $60 million less than requested by the President. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate appropriations measures into a Minibus, approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. An amendment by Senator Coburn aimed to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The House and Senate reconciled differences in the bill H.R. 2112 through a conference report, which was approved and signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The law allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The funding for CDBG formula grants was 10.7% less than in FY2011, but included $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states and entitlement communities. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was 10.7% less than in FY2011, 19.6% less than requested by the President, and 15% less than recommended by the House. Other CDF activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative were not funded directly, but could be carried out using CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The decrease in CDBG funding and elimination of other program funding reflect efforts to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. P.L. 112-55 did not include provisions from the Senate version of H.R. 2112 that would have restricted the use of federal grants for loan repayment or reduced the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. The act P.L. 112-55 reduced the funds for administrative expenses from 20% to 10% for grantees. It also mandated a study by the GAO on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME programs, with a report due within 180 days. HUD was required to submit a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days. The act maintained the structure of the Section 108 loan guarantees program and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies. P.L. 112-55 appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for the Section 108 loan guarantee program. It also included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. Funds were to be used for disaster relief, long-term recovery plans, housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, signed into law on April 15, 2011, appropriated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The act allowed waivers of certain CDBG program requirements to facilitate disaster recovery efforts, with $100 million exempted from discretionary spending limits. The FY2011 Act appropriated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a 0.2% rescission and a 1% transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account to $3.501 billion, 16% lower than FY2010. The CDF, including the Community Development Block Grant program, faced significant budget reductions in earlier legislation. The House passed H.R. 1 in an effort to reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting funding for discretionary programs, including the CDF account. The bill did not win Senate approval, leading to negotiations between the Obama Administration and Congress. Eventually, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, into law on April 15, 2011. The House and Senate passed P.L. 112-10, a temporary spending measure to avoid a government shutdown. It allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with a 0.2% cut and a 1% transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account to $3.501 billion and transferred $35 million. The CDF account for FY2010 was appropriated $3.501 billion, 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%. The account also includes funds for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI). The CDF account for FY2010 received $3.501 billion, 21.3% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The account includes the CDBG program, with formula-based grants reduced by 16.4%. Funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) was also affected, with a 33% reduction in funding. The House passed H.R. 1, which would have cut the CDF account by 66.3% and prohibited funds for earmarks and SCI. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1, proposing $4.230 billion for CDF activities, including $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. The Senate bill would have frozen CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. Additionally, the bill would have funded the Rural Innovation Fund, University Community Fund, and SCI programs at their FY2010 levels. The FY2011 appropriations for the formula-based components of the CDBG program totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease from the $3.943 billion allocated in FY2010. In FY2012, the CDBG allocations for entitlement communities and states decreased to $2.942 billion, resulting in a decline in average grant amounts. The average grant amount for entitlement communities decreased by 29.1% from FY2010 to FY2012, while the average state allocation declined by 25.4%. The average state allocation for CDBG funding declined by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. The proposed reduction in funding included in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development and job creation efforts. This would also undercut the resources of non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program disproportionately affects low and moderate income households, with the FY2012 appropriations being the lowest in over a decade. This will lead to delays in projects and reduced support for activities, including those by community-based organizations. The average state allocation for CDBG funding declined by 25.4% from FY2010 to FY2012. The CDBG program funding was reduced, impacting low and moderate-income households. FY2012 appropriations were the lowest in over a decade, leading to project delays and reduced support for activities. State allocations for CDBG funding decreased by 25.4% from FY2010 to FY2012. Entitlement communities receive 70% of funds, while nonentitlement communities receive 30%. The CDBG program allocates funds to eligible entitlement communities and states using two formulas, Formula A and Formula B. Formula A considers population, poverty, and overcrowded housing, while Formula B includes a population growth lag factor. The CDBG program, governed by P.L. 95-128, allocates funds based on weighted factors including population growth lag, poverty, and housing built before 1940. States receive funds through Formula A and Formula B, which consider population, poverty, overcrowded housing, and poverty housing built before 1940. HUD uses the most recent data from the Census Bureau and OMB for allocation. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates for CDBG fund allocations, allowing for more accurate reflection of demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census for data sources. In December 2011, HUD released a study on the impacts of the introduction of 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG formula grant funds allocation. The HUD study analyzed the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG formula grant funds allocation. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decline in CDBG allocations, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced an increase. The new data sources affected the distribution of funds. The introduction of new data sources led to changes in CDBG allocations, with principal cities and urban counties receiving more funds while other entitlement cities saw a decrease. Some regions experienced an increase in allocations, while New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest decline in funding. The report includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history. The report reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, focusing on CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and earmarks. Total appropriations fluctuated between $5.112 billion in FY2001 and $3.772 billion in FY2007. FY2011 saw the lowest appropriations in over a decade, with debates on funding levels for the CDBG-formula component. Supporters argue for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations and increased entitlement communities. Supporters of the CDBG program argue that funding has declined, leading to a smaller allocation for entitlement communities. Critics question the justification for increased funding, citing the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending. Despite a decline in average grant amounts from FY2000 to FY2010, there has been a slight increase since FY2008. Since FY2008, the average allocation for CDBG has increased by 9%, reaching $2.4 million in FY2010. However, the estimated average allocation for FY2011 is $1.9 million, a 34.5% decrease from FY2000. The decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving direct allocations increased by 155 from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated to states and Puerto Rico, 7.4% less than in FY2000 but 7.6% more than in FY2009. The average state allocation for CDBG has fluctuated over the years, reaching a high of $25.5 million in FY2002 before declining to $19.1 million in FY2011. In inflation-adjusted constant dollars, program funding decreased by 40% from FY2000 to FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have varied between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in the last decade. The CDF also includes smaller programs with specific objectives and fewer recipients. The CDF account includes various set-aside programs that complement the larger formula grant program. Funding for these programs has fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with Congress appropriating varying amounts for earmarked activities such as the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). Congress has made decisions to move categorical grant programs in and out of the CDF account, leading to significant changes in funding levels for set-aside programs. From FY2000 to FY2011, funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs, including funding reductions, transfers, and earmarks for EDI and NI programs. CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars but rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010 before declining again in FY2011. Earmarked projects funded by EDI and NI programs were dominant, sparking debate on earmarks in recent Congresses. During FY2007, Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account, sparking debate on earmarks. New rules were instituted for disclosure of earmark requests, with EDI and NI earmarks included in subsequent legislation. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks dominated CDBG-linked set-asides programs. Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks in FY2011. Supplemental funds from the CDBG program have been used for disaster relief and recovery efforts. The state government has been involved in disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities following events like 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. They also assist in reducing abandoned and foreclosed properties caused by the mortgage foreclosure crisis through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Additionally, they support private sector job creation in response to the economic recession under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Funding for disaster relief and NSP is allocated based on specific criteria, with CDBG disaster funding only going to communities designated as disaster areas by presidential declaration. Funds for disaster relief and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program are allocated by Congress based on specific criteria. The NSP-1 and NSP-3 programs provided funds to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates, with a minimum grant amount established. States were required to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high foreclosure rates, with a minimum threshold for direct allocation to communities. This resulted in 309 communities qualifying for NSP-1 funds and 268 for NSP-3 funds. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs on March 2, 2011. On March 9, 2011, the committee approved an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. The notice of termination of the NSP program is to be posted on HUD's website within five days of the bill's enactment. Representative Miller criticized the program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, arguing for its funding to be rescinded. Others defended the program, stating it has successfully helped communities combat the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD expects NSP to impact 100,000 properties. HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Mercedes M. M\u00e1rquez, testified that the NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182, but a companion bill has not been introduced in the Senate."
