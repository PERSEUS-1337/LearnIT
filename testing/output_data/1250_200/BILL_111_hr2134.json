    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009\". Congress finds that drug use in the United States is significant, with millions of users of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin. The majority of cocaine and heroin in the US originates from Andean countries and Colombia and Mexico, respectively. The cultivation and trafficking of these drugs in these countries lead to violence, instability, and corruption. Additionally, drug trafficking in transit countries poses a threat to law enforcement, political institutions, citizen security, and US interests. Drug-related violence is increasing in Mexico and along the US-Mexico border, with 5,661 deaths in 2008 alone. Organized criminal networks in Mexico traffic women and girls into the US for sexual exploitation. Extremist groups like FARC and Hezbollah use drug trafficking to fund terrorist activities. US counternarcotics assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean totaled $11.3 billion from 1980-2008. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission is established to review and evaluate US policies on illicit drug supply reduction and interdiction in the Western Hemisphere. Its purpose is to identify policy options to improve existing counternarcotics policies. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will review US policies on illicit drug supply reduction, interdiction, and demand reduction. It will assess international drug control policies, interdiction efforts, economic development alternatives, technology deployment against drug cartels, and efforts to curb chemical precursor trafficking. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will assess efforts to curb chemical precursor trafficking for illicit drugs, the effectiveness of US drug certification process, the demand for illicit drugs in the US population, drug prevention and treatment programs, and recommendations to improve US policies on reducing illicit drug supply and demand. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will assess ways to improve US policies on reducing illicit drug supply and demand, including consulting with various leaders and organizations in the region. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will submit a report to various committees and officials detailing its recommendations, findings, and conclusions within 12 months of its first meeting.
