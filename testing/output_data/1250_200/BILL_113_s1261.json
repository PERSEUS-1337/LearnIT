    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy based on their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. Each Federal agency must develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. This strategy should consider various ICT services and products, data center strategies, power management, building energy management, and telework tools. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems. This includes specifications and benchmarks for data center operators. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems, including specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed decisions about energy efficiency and cost savings. This includes an overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency, asset utilization, and recommendations for achieving benchmarks, such as evaluating energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. The Director will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient information technology systems, including measuring costs and savings over 3 to 5 years. A Federal Data Centers Task Force will be maintained, consisting of program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The Federal Data Centers Task Force, comprised of program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers, will collaborate to achieve agency energy efficiency goals and share best practices with the private sector. Federal agencies must report their efforts and results under this subsection in their annual agency reports as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director will also include this information in the annual OMB government efficiency reports and scorecards starting from October 1, 2013. Starting from October 1, 2013, the Director will include in the annual report and scorecard a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results under this subsection. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for coordinating energy efficiency programs and conducting a study on server and data center energy efficiency. Under Public Law 109-431, a comparison and analysis of estimates and projections from 2007 to 2012, considering the impact of information technologies, and updated recommendations for best practices are required. The Secretary will collaborate with a designated organization for this report. Additionally, a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program will be maintained for certification of energy practitioners in collaboration with the Federal Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer will maintain a data center energy practitioner program for certifying individuals to assess energy usage and efficiency in data centers. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. A new open data initiative will be established to make energy usage data accessible while safeguarding national security interests. The Secretary will establish an open data initiative to make data center energy efficiency information accessible while protecting national security interests. This initiative will consider the use of the online Data Center Maturity Model and collaborate on global specifications and metrics for energy efficiency. Additionally, an efficiency metric will be developed to measure the energy efficiency of data centers, including ICT systems and related infrastructure."
