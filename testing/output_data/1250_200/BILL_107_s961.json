    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The findings section of the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\" highlights the lack of a patient registry for breast implant recipients, estimates on the number of women with breast implants, adverse reaction reports received by the FDA, the need for complete information on health risks, and the fact that silicone breast implants have never been approved. Silicone breast implants were never approved by the FDA, while saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. A criminal investigation was opened in 1998 due to allegations of research data manipulation by a breast implant manufacturer. The FDA panel considering market approval for saline implants in 2000 was not informed of this investigation. In 2000, the FDA approved saline breast implants despite ongoing investigations into complications. Studies have shown high rates of additional surgeries and implant ruptures, with silicone migration in some cases. The impact of silicone on disease development is still unknown. The influence of silicone breast implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies was found to be statistically significant, indicating potential serious implications. Studies have shown that local complications with silicone breast implants are a primary safety concern, with a lack of comprehensive research on these issues. Concerns persist about the potential for silicone breast implants to contribute to connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. Additionally, a study found higher rates of lung and brain cancer among breast implant recipients compared to other plastic surgery patients. Implant recipients with silicone breast implants may suffer from higher rates of lung and brain cancer. Studies have shown evidence of silicone migration in ruptured implants, leading to severe inflammation and complications. The presence of silicone implants can also make mammograms less accurate, delaying the detection of breast cancer. According to a 2000 FDA publication, breast implants may impact breast feeding. The purpose of the Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants and ensure accurate information for women. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regulates the availability of silicone breast implants for various medical purposes. The National Institutes of Health will provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act will include a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, involving various Institutes. Study sections are established to review grant applications for appropriate design. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research and establishes study sections to review grant applications for appropriate design. The NIH conducts research to understand the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, focusing on local complications and atypical symptoms over an eight-year period. The Director of NIH conducts research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, focusing on complications like leakage, loss of sensation, deflation, rupture, silicone migration, neurological issues, and immune system irregularities. An annual report is submitted to Congress on the study results. SEC. 4. The FDA will evaluate saline breast implant manufacturers' data based on postmarket recommendations from the FDA's panel. Reports to Congress on implementation status will be provided at regular intervals.\n\nSEC. 5. The FDA will expand and intensify activities related to silicone breast implants. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expedite the conclusion of a criminal investigation into wrongdoing by a silicone breast implant manufacturer, update consumer information materials, and require manufacturers to regularly update package inserts with accurate information on implant complications. Require manufacturers conducting clinical studies on silicone breast implants to provide prospective patients with FDA's breast implant booklet, amend study protocols to ensure patients receive informed consent documents at initial consultation, inform women about how to report concerns or problems with the study, and provide a Medwatch form. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements annually, ensuring consumer information is accurate and thorough. Panel members include saline and silicone breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research related to breast implants."
