The Secretary will provide grants to eligible persons to help pay for child care services for dependents by eligible child care providers. A dependent is defined as an individual meeting specific criteria, and an eligible person is a parent of a dependent who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces on active duty for more than 30 days in support of a military operation. The Secretary provides grants to eligible parents of dependents in the Armed Forces on active duty for child care services during military operations, if they reside at least 50 miles from military installations with child care facilities. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a person must submit an application to the Secretary with details about the child care provider and comply with the relevant provisions of the subchapter. The grants are provided to parents of dependents in the Armed Forces during military operations if they live at least 50 miles away from military installations with child care facilities. Military operations include Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, or any successor operation. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a person must submit an application to the Secretary with details about the child care provider. The provisions of this subchapter, other than section 658P, that apply to assistance provided under this subchapter shall not apply to assistance provided under this grant. Section 658O of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to change the appropriations under different sections."
