    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. Colorado and Washington were the first to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia approved measures to legalize marijuana cultivation, possession, and exchange. Polls show a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. Bills in Congress propose removing marijuana from Schedule I drugs and imposing a federal excise tax on it. The debate on marijuana legalization spans criminal justice and public policy issues. The debate on marijuana legalization includes the potential revenue from taxing marijuana. This report focuses on imposing an excise tax on legalized marijuana, analyzing possible tax designs and arguments for taxation. Marijuana, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is primarily used for its psychoactive effects, with THC being the main active compound. Marijuana contains various cannabinoids, with THC being the main compound responsible for the psychoactive effects. Different strains may have varying levels of cannabinoids, such as CBD for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary based on preparation. Female plants grown without pollination produce buds with higher resin content. When female marijuana plants are grown without pollination, they produce buds with higher resin content, known as sinsemilla varieties with 10%-18% THC. Consumption methods include smoking joints or blunts, with various devices like glass pipes and vaporizers also available. Other products like hashish have different THC concentrations and consumption methods. Cannabis can be processed into various products with different THC levels and consumption methods. Hashish, with over 40% THC, is made by pressing trichomes together. THC can also be used in edibles like candy or baked goods. Excise taxes on marijuana can serve to reflect external costs, discourage use, prevent price falls, fund programs, and raise revenue for economic efficiency. Similar taxes have been imposed on alcohol and tobacco for similar reasons. Imposing a tax equal to consumption cost on marijuana can achieve economic efficiency, similar to alcohol and tobacco. Economic analysis suggests external costs should be separated from user costs, with society bearing some costs like lost tax revenue and health expenses. External costs are typically smaller than total costs, with a 1991 study estimating a $30 billion cost for alcohol and tobacco. The cost of alcohol is estimated at $30 billion, which can be used to estimate the cost of marijuana. Comparing the harm of alcohol and cannabis, alcohol ranks higher in harm at 72 compared to cannabis at 20. Studies suggest that marijuana has lower health costs per user and impairs driving ability less than alcohol. Non-health costs of marijuana are also likely lower than for alcohol. Studies show that marijuana impairs driving less than alcohol and is inversely related to domestic violence. Marijuana usage is less common than alcohol, with external costs estimated at $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. The 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the total market size and price of marijuana in the United States, with total expenditures ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion in 2010. The report also notes an increase in THC levels from 2000 to 2010, leading to potential taxes of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report estimates the price of marijuana from 2000 to 2010, showing a constant nominal price but likely decreasing inflation-adjusted price. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and informal interviews suggest variations. Different techniques and data sources, like priceofweed.com, estimate the price at $317 per ounce, but data representativeness is unclear. The price of marijuana varies, with reports indicating prices as low as $28 per eighth of an ounce in some areas. Tax rates on marijuana range from 0.8% to 5.3%, contributing to higher prices due to the illicit market. Estimates suggest external costs of $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. In a legal market, prices would be lower, potentially as low as $5 per ounce. The largest estimate equates to $0.30 per joint. The largest estimate for the tax on a joint is $0.30, comparable to the tax on a six-pack of beer. States also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, which are likely higher than the external costs of marijuana. Imposing a tax on marijuana could discourage users, especially underage users who may underestimate long-term health costs and dependence risks. Some argue that marijuana use can lead to dependence, with studies showing a 9% dependency rate among users. Medical marijuana laws in the US may increase the likelihood of abuse or dependency by 15%-27% in adults. More research is needed to better understand the risks of marijuana. Economists debate whether users make informed choices or engage in time-inconsistent behavior. The issue of determining a tax on marijuana involves balancing user interests with potential income reduction. An important issue in determining a tax on marijuana is balancing user interests with potential income reduction. Heavy users consume a disproportionate share of marijuana, similar to alcohol consumption. A marijuana tax would primarily affect heavy users, making it regressive. Evaluating the benefit of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on how users respond to price changes. The tax on marijuana can heavily impact heavy users, making it regressive. Economists use elasticities to measure responses to price changes, with studies showing that demand for marijuana is relatively unresponsive to price changes. Gallet's research predicts a decrease in demand ranging from -0.15% to -0.31% for every 1% increase in price. This suggests that users may be harmed by a tax imposed for their own benefit. The tax on marijuana may harm users overall as demand is unresponsive to price changes. Government policies aim to limit drug use by minors, with taxes potentially more effective in reducing youth consumption. The question arises on how much tax burden should be placed on adult users to limit youth consumption. The tax on marijuana aims to limit youth consumption by keeping prices from falling significantly with legalization. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease due to increased production and reduced law enforcement costs. This may require a relatively high tax initially, which could be adjusted based on market consequences. In a legalized market for marijuana, firms may gain market power and charge higher prices for their brands. However, a competitive market would lead to lower prices reflecting lower production costs. A federal tax rate should be considered to offset the price reduction from legalization, but it should not be set too high to discourage illicit production. Caulkins (2010) estimates the costs of producing and processing legalized marijuana. Caulkins (2010) estimates the production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor production costing less but containing lower THC levels. Processing costs add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus $35 per pound, while outdoor production costs around $10 plus $35 per pound. THC concentration varies, with sinsemilla being three times more potent than commercial-grade marijuana. Sinsemilla contains 10%-18% THC, three times more potent than commercial-grade marijuana. Estimated costs for government-sponsored marijuana in Canada range from $5-$18 per ounce ($80-$288 per pound). Prices for medical marijuana in Canada vary from $1.80-$5 per gram to $10-$15 per gram on the street. Street prices can be discounted for larger quantities. Beginning in April 2014, the Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 (CAD) per gram, higher than the average and closer to street prices. Small growers and homegrown marijuana are no longer allowed under the new law. Actual prices can be seen on websites like Leafly.com, which provides consumer reviews and menu prices of products available at marijuana shops in Colorado. Leafly provides consumer reviews and menu prices of marijuana products in Colorado. Prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high-quality marijuana priced at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. These prices suggest falling prices with legalization, but they may not reflect those in a fully legal market. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high-quality marijuana priced at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. Legalization may lead to a significant price decrease, with estimates ranging from more than 80% to 50%. However, the quasi-legal status of the market in Colorado poses challenges such as limited banking assistance, high federal income taxes, and potential enforcement from federal authorities. Estimates for legalized marijuana prices range from $40-$60 per ounce to $100-$150 per ounce. Street prices currently range from $200-$300 per ounce, suggesting room for taxes up to $200 per ounce to align with legal prices. However, setting taxes too high could encourage the illicit market, undermining the goal of eliminating it through legalization. Legalizing marijuana could help eliminate the illicit market and reduce law enforcement costs. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be the best approach initially. Tax revenue could fund research on medical marijuana, which is approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Barriers to marijuana research include federal approval challenges and the drug's Schedule I classification. Legalization would make it easier to study the efficacy and side effects of marijuana for various conditions. Legalization of marijuana could lead to the elimination of the illicit market and reduce law enforcement costs. Tax revenue from marijuana sales could fund research on its efficacy and side effects for medical use. An excise tax on marijuana could generate revenue for information programs on risks and discourage consumption by minors. The revenue consequences of such a tax are uncertain due to market price and quantity fluctuations. Casual consumers entering the market could also increase revenue. Legalization of marijuana could lead to the elimination of the illicit market and reduce law enforcement costs. Tax revenue from marijuana sales could fund research on its efficacy and side effects for medical use. An excise tax on marijuana could generate revenue for information programs on risks and discourage consumption by minors. The potential revenue from nationwide legalization of marijuana is uncertain due to market fluctuations and the entry of casual consumers. Some analysts estimate that nationwide legalization of marijuana could generate $5.8 billion annually in excise taxes. This estimate is based on a 50% tax rate on the price to consumers, with a projected market size of $13.13 billion and a 25% increase in consumption. Additionally, there could be $3.3 billion in annual savings from reduced law enforcement expenditures. Waldock notes that their market size estimates are smaller compared to others, assuming a higher consumer response. The calculation outlines estimating revenues from an excise tax using a $50 per ounce tax, considering aggregate consumption and income tax interactions. Revenue yield estimation requires data on price and quantity, with market value ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. Assuming a $40 billion market and $250 current price, potential revenue effects are illustrated with a fully legalized industry, including state and federal taxes totaling $50 per ounce, bringing the total price to $150 per ounce. The federal excise tax revenue from a fully legalized industry with a total price of $150 per ounce is estimated to be $9.1 billion, considering a 14% increase in quantity. Comparatively, the tax on alcoholic beverages is $10 billion, applied to a larger market. The estimated federal excise tax revenue from a fully legalized marijuana industry is $9.1 billion, with a projected revenue gain of $6.8 billion after accounting for income and wage tax losses. The short-term yield may be less than $300 million due to limited legalization in Colorado and Washington. Tax collection data from these states could provide insights into the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could serve as early indicators of the potential tax base of a national legalized market. In Colorado, marijuana sales are subject to multiple state taxes, including a 15% excise tax on the unprocessed product, a 10% retail excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. Local taxes may also apply. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014, with additional revenue from medical marijuana sales. Extrapolating from this data could estimate the national marijuana market. After analyzing tax revenue data from Colorado, it is estimated that the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. Medical marijuana consumption could roughly double that base. Combined sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion, indicating potential for growth in the industry. The market for marijuana in Colorado is underdeveloped, with significant illicit sales due to lower prices or existing relationships. Consumption may be inflated by non-resident sales. Design issues for an excise tax include levying it at earlier production stages to reduce costs and prevent tax evasion. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed on manufacturers and imports. Marijuana can be taxed based on unit measurement or product price, each with its own pros and cons. A weight-based tax system for marijuana could be similar to the federal excise tax on tobacco, with regulations limiting the size of products. This type of tax is relatively easy to administer but could lead to the production of more potent marijuana. On the other hand, a potency-based tax, based on THC content per ounce, could be more complex and costly to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing of strains. The administrative challenge of a potency-based tax on marijuana is ensuring accurate lab testing of strains. Regulations would define sample size and weight for testing, with costs ranging from $60-$120 per test. More labs entering the market could lower testing prices but may also lead to unreliable THC measurements. This tax system could potentially increase consumption of less-potent marijuana, impacting public health costs. A potency-based tax on marijuana could impact public health costs by potentially increasing consumption of less-potent marijuana. An alternative calculation based on THC to CBD ratio could encourage purchasing marijuana with more sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, automatically adjust for price changes and can be applied to a wide range of products. However, the main disadvantage is the need for regulations to specify taxable prices. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes a 50% tax on producer or importer prices. A manufacturers tax is a simple form of administration imposed at the manufacturer stage for products like tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Retail tax regimes, resembling sales tax, can capture price markups due to product type or market power. The price of marijuana products can be determined by various characteristics. Per unit taxes can be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Other federal excise taxes are unindexed and have declined in real value. Given the uncertainty over prices and demand after legalization, sunset provisions for the tax could be incorporated into any initial authorizing language of a marijuana tax. This could encourage legislators to revisit marijuana tax laws to better reflect the evolving conditions of the industry. Various methods of taxation could be used, such as setting the initial tax rate low to undermine the illicit market and gradually increasing it to limit consumption. Differential tax rates based on THC content or product type could also be implemented to shape consumption patterns. Different tax rates based on THC content or product type could shape consumption patterns and reduce negative social costs of marijuana. However, this approach may lead to unequal tax burdens among consumers. Alcohol is taxed based on potency and category, while cigarettes are taxed per unit. Integrating existing marijuana stocks into the tax base would require addressing taxation of plants and consumer goods in jurisdictions with legalized sales. This could help producers and retailers meet initial demand at competitive prices. Integrating marijuana plants and products into the tax base could help meet initial demand, reduce complexity in tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue. However, existing products may not comply with new regulations. Providing lead time before legalized sales could help producers comply but add complexity to taxation. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to this issue. In Washington, current plants can be converted to legal stocks with a producer license and meeting state guidelines. Federal excise taxes on untaxed floor stocks aim to prevent inventory buildup before tax effective date. Issues may arise on restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under federal marijuana tax. Policy makers can decide on federal regulations or let states create their own laws. Age restrictions in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana purchases to individuals aged 21 or older, potentially affecting the tax base. Younger individuals use marijuana at higher rates than those over 26 years old, but this trend may change post-legalization. Excluding these consumers from the legal tax base could support underground production or indirect sales. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana, while non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion. More restrictive purchasing limits and ad valorem tax rates can increase the effective tax rate on heavy users. Production limits could be enacted to monitor diversion of sales and guide the number of licenses issued in the marijuana market. Mark Kleiman suggests that limits could reduce negative social consequences and prevent larger producers from maximizing profit. A tax at the beginning of the production chain may help monitor diversion of exports. Production limits could reduce negative social consequences of marijuana consumption by limiting the power of larger producers seeking to maximize profit. However, implementing production limits may lead to inefficiency and windfall profits for existing firms. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies by jurisdiction, with some applying general sales tax or special gross receipts taxes. The contentious issue of medical marijuana use may attract consumers who prefer legal markets over illicit ones, potentially reducing the use of prescription drugs in states where medical marijuana is available. Evidence suggests a negative correlation between medical marijuana and prescription drugs, with deaths from prescription drug overdoses declining in states with medical marijuana. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if strict standards for medical prescriptions are not enforced. Rules for excise taxation vary, with Colorado allowing home growing for recreational use while Washington does not permit it. Colorado allows individuals to grow up to six plants for recreational use, and households can grow up to 12 plants. Washington does not allow home growing of marijuana for recreational use. In federal law, no home distilling of alcohol is legal, whereas wine and beer can be made in limited amounts, and tobacco can be grown without limit. The issue of home production being exempt from taxation raises questions about quantity limits, with experts suggesting that a single plant can yield a pound of marijuana and the average user consumes less than four ounces per year. Despite concerns about undermining enforcement, home production is not seen as a significant threat to tax revenue. Caulkins et al. suggest that home production of marijuana could undermine enforcement and tax revenue. Banning home production may increase revenue from marijuana taxes. Small producers could be eligible for lower tax rates, similar to wine and beer producers. However, it may be more efficient to collect taxes from larger producers. A lower tax on outdoor marijuana cultivation, which is more energy-efficient, could be considered. Legalization could reduce marijuana prices and promote cost-effective outdoor cultivation practices. Legalization of marijuana could lead to cheaper outdoor cultivation practices, but concerns exist about negative environmental effects. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana may encourage indoor production. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on marijuana producers and manufacturers. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on marijuana producers and manufacturers to enforce compliance and deter illicit transactions. Enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, similar to historical examples from the end of Prohibition in the 1930s. Legalizing and taxing marijuana could potentially undermine the federal tax base without adequate resources for enforcement. Marijuana smuggling may be more prevalent due to its compact nature, but methods like tax stamps or genetic markers could help monitor production and sales. Oglesby discusses new technological developments for monitoring marijuana production, such as genetic markers and tracking systems. Colorado enforces tracking marijuana plants from \"seed to sale\" using RFID tags. Regulations for standardizing weights and potency measurements would be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different strains of marijuana. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could develop marketing standards for labeling and branding different strains of marijuana to inform consumers and prevent competition. Different tax rates in medical and recreational marijuana could create arbitrage opportunities for consumers, especially heavy users. Enforcement of regulations for proper tax collection from nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries is crucial. Industrial hemp has low THC concentrations and changes to U.S. policies were made by the 113th Congress regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate. The Agricultural Act of 2014 allows certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp has low THC concentrations and can be distinguished from marijuana for tax purposes based on THC quantity. Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC by weight to distinguish legal hemp from illegal marijuana. The argument that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields is likely overstated due to cross-pollination weakening marijuana plants. The delay of federal legalization could impact state marijuana tax policies. State-based monopolies for marijuana sales are debated for their regulation potential versus susceptibility to corruption. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets make it challenging to predict revenue outcomes, including post-legalization prices, market size, and consumer responses to price changes. These uncertainties also complicate decisions on tax levels and implementation methods. Setting the level and method of imposing taxes on legalized marijuana is complicated by uncertainties regarding consumer response to potency and price, compliance costs, and revenue potential compared to alcohol and tobacco. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption is a key factor in determining the social costs of legalization, with potential positive spillover effects on society if marijuana serves as a substitute for alcohol. The social costs of alcohol consumption have been extensively studied. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, it may have positive effects on society due to lower social costs. However, if consumed with alcohol, it could have negative effects. Research on this topic lacks consensus, with many economic studies not capturing long-term effects or examining representative populations. Marijuana research in the US is highly regulated, with limited focus on potential medical benefits. The effects of commercial and recreational legalization, as seen in Colorado and Washington, have not been fully studied elsewhere. The effects of marijuana legalization on society, particularly in relation to alcohol consumption, have not been extensively studied on the scale of Colorado and Washington. Research on polydrug use and the potential social costs of marijuana legalization vary, with some suggesting it could lead to further illicit drug use. Limited research exists on the long-term effects and representative populations, hindering the ability to levy a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. Marijuana has a lower risk of addiction compared to cocaine, crack, or heroin. Some believe it may lead to further illicit drug use. Research on marijuana's impact on traffic fatalities is limited, with conflicting findings on its association with crashes. Marijuana is frequently detected in drivers involved in accidents, but a causal link is not established. Studies on marijuana use and traffic fatalities show that current testing technology is limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels accurately. This can lead to false positives for recent users and chronic medical marijuana patients. Some argue that marijuana legalization could result in significant savings in criminal justice spending. Legalizing marijuana could lead to significant savings in criminal justice spending at federal, state, and local levels. Estimates vary, with some suggesting savings of $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs. However, subsequent research indicates that the actual savings may be smaller. Federal legalization may not impact inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. Federal legalization of marijuana would not affect federal inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. It is uncertain how this legalization might impact the future federal prison population. In state and local jails, drug violations make up about one-fifth of incarcerations, with marijuana-only violations accounting for less than 10% of those charges. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to a 2% decrease in prisoners in jails over time. However, these benefits would be dependent on the successful legalization and not overly burdensome taxes or regulations that could encourage the continuation of the illicit market. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to the higher price per pound of these other drugs. The black market for illicit drugs is primarily focused on illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to the higher price per pound of these other drugs. Marijuana producers and retailers are unable to deduct expenses for selling their product according to the Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. The IRS enforces tax penalties on marijuana-related businesses by refusing to accept business deductions, creating economic incentives for underground activity. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged these penalties in court. The discrepancies between federal and state tax treatments contribute to the issue. The current tax laws create economic incentives for underground marijuana businesses due to the inability to deduct business expenses, resulting in implicit taxes up to 39.6% or 35%. Illicit sellers have an advantage as they are not directly taxed on their sales. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions. An estimate of the national marijuana tax base can be calculated using data from Colorado or Washington, although it may underestimate total demand. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to calculate the state's marijuana tax base. The recreational tax base is derived from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax or the 2.9% general sales tax, with the two calculations averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales. The Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. This data can be used to estimate $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in Colorado for that month. By extrapolating this data to other states and the District of Columbia, an estimate of the national sales tax base can be calculated based on population and marijuana usage rates. The calculation for estimating national sales tax base for recreational marijuana in Colorado is based on population and usage rates, not price changes. Using August 2014 data, the estimated tax base is $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year. Medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million in September 2014, with monthly sales ranging from $31 million to $35 million in 2014. In FY2013, Colorado's medical marijuana tax base was $314.2 million in sales. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has impacted medical marijuana demand. Medical marijuana consumption in Colorado could exceed total marijuana consumption, even with stricter regulations post-legalization. Users denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational use."
