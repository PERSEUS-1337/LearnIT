    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate the Lamprey River in New Hampshire as a recreational river, with a 23.5 mile segment from Bunker Pond Dam to the Piscassic River. The administration will be through cooperative agreements between the Secretary of the Interior and the State of New Hampshire. The Lamprey River in New Hampshire, including specific towns, will be managed according to the Lamprey River Management Plan and its amendments as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. The plan satisfies the requirements for the designated recreational river segment. The Lamprey River in New Hampshire will be managed in coordination with the Lamprey River Advisory Committee. Zoning ordinances in specific towns will include provisions for conservation of shoreland, floodplains, and wetlands associated with the river segment. The conservation of shoreland, floodplains, and wetlands associated with the Lamprey River segment will satisfy certain standards and requirements, prohibiting federal acquisition of lands by condemnation. The Secretary's authority to acquire land for this purpose is limited to donation or purchase. The acquisition of land along the Lamprey River segment is limited to donation or with the owner's consent, subject to criteria in the Lamprey River Management Plan. Section 405 of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 is repealed."
