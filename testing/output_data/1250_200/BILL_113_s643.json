    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013\" and includes cost savings enhancements. The \"Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013\" amends Section 4512 of title 5, United States Code to include the identification of surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority. The Inspector General or designated agency employee must refer any identified surplus funds to the Chief Financial Officer of the agency for review and potential rescission if it does not hinder effectiveness. The \"Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013\" allows for the transfer of surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority to the general fund of the Treasury. Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 does not apply to these transfers. The transferred amounts are used for deficit reduction or to reduce the Federal debt. The head of an agency can retain up to 10% of the transferred amounts for cash awards to employees who identified the surplus funds. The head of each agency must report annually to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management on employee disclosures of fraud, waste, or surplus funds, total savings achieved, and cash awards given. This information must also be included in the agency's budget request to the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must submit an annual report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office on Federal cost savings and awards. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must ensure agency compliance with cash award programs and submit an annual certification to Congress. The Comptroller General of the United States will report to Congress every 3 years on the operation of the cost savings and awards program. Additionally, certain officers are prohibited from receiving cash awards. In this section, the term 'agency' is defined and includes certain entities. Officers in specific positions are prohibited from receiving cash awards under this subchapter. A technical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 45 of title 5, United States Code. Prohibition of cash award to certain officers."
