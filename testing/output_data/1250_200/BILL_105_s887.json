    "content": "The Act titled \"National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1997\" is established for the purpose of recognizing and preserving the history of the Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad was a significant expression of the American civil rights movement, bridging divides of race, religion, and nationality. The Underground Railroad Advisory Committee conducted a study to establish a national commemorative program. The Underground Railroad Advisory Committee found that many important sites related to the Underground Railroad are in danger of being lost or destroyed, and not adequately represented or protected. There are high potential sites for preservation and visitor use in 29 States, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. No single site or route completely reflects the Underground Railroad, as its story involves networks and regions of the country. Various partnerships between the Federal Government and other levels are needed for preservation efforts. The National Park Service can play a vital role in commemorating the Underground Railroad through a national program that links historic sites, interpretive centers, museums, and community projects in a unified and flexible manner. The purposes of this Act are to recognize the importance of the Underground Railroad and the sacrifices made by slaves who used it. The Act aims to recognize the significance of the Underground Railroad, the sacrifices of slaves seeking freedom, and the efforts of those who assisted them.
