The Congress finds that the Caribbean region is a vital \"third border\" for the United States due to its proximity and importance as a tourist destination. Issues such as unemployment, weak judicial systems, environmental degradation, and natural disasters in the region directly impact the well-being of the United States. The public sector in many Caribbean countries lacks proper training and authority, hindering efficiency. Economic growth in the Caribbean region has lagged behind Latin America, leading to lower living standards and tax revenues. Highly trained labor is often scarce in the region. The Caribbean region faces challenges such as limited trained labor, government red tape hindering private sector growth, reliance on few exports, high transportation costs, and the need for a regional corporate strategy. Small countries are struggling due to declining banana production and potential loss of EU trade preferences, leading to economic and social stress. Economic displacement of farmers and workers in the banana industry is a significant concern.

Small countries are struggling due to declining banana production and potential loss of EU trade preferences, leading to economic and social stress. The workforce in the region, comprising approximately 50 percent of some Caribbean countries, will continue to place added pressures on their economies. Growth in these small open economies can only be achieved by becoming more competitive in the global market. Deterioration in economic, social, and political conditions is leading to increased crime and illegal immigration to the United States. The United States is concerned about narcotics trafficking in the region and bilateral cooperation with Caribbean governments in drug interdiction and combating money laundering is ongoing. The efficiency and fairness of the legal systems in the Caribbean region are crucial for its economic and social development. The legal systems in the Caribbean region are perceived as inefficient and ineffective, needing improvement for better administration of law and justice. The ecosystems supporting the economies are under severe stress due to environmental issues like inadequate waste management and coastal zone practices. The region also faces the second-highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate globally, with the epidemic spreading to the general population in some countries. The Caribbean region faces challenges with inefficient legal systems, environmental stress, and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The United States has shown commitment to supporting democratic governments and economies in the region through initiatives like the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act and the Bridgetown Barbados Summit. Leaders have pledged to strengthen cooperation in trade, economic development, and security. In a summit declaration in Santiago, Chile, leaders emphasized the benefits of open trade for the Americas.
