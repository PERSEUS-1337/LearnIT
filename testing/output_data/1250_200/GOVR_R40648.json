    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee has suggested a surtax on high-income individuals, while the Senate Finance Committee proposed an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796 with an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama proposed changes to the revenue provisions of the bill, including delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018 and raising the exemption threshold. The new plan also includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed the Senate proposal, H.R. 3590, and H.R. 4872. Both bills were signed into law in March 2010. H.R. 4872, signed into law in March 2010, includes detailed revenue estimates and tax proposals that vary in their effects on income distribution. The tax changes range from progressive to regressive, with limits on itemized deductions and high adjusted gross incomes affecting higher-income taxpayers. Excise taxes tend to be regressive and impact lower-income classes more heavily. The revenue raisers proposed in the House and Senate bills, as well as by President Obama, include an increased Medicare tax and other health-related fees. These proposals may have regressive effects on income distribution, particularly impacting lower-income classes. However, the overall health care reform proposals are likely to benefit lower-income families, potentially redistributing in their favor. Other financing proposals from the Obama Administration and previous congressional work are also discussed in the report. The revenue raisers proposed in the House and Senate bills, as well as by President Obama, include an increased Medicare tax and other health-related fees. These proposals may have regressive effects on income distribution, particularly impacting lower-income classes. The largest revenue raisers over FY2010-FY2019 include a tax on wage income, a tax on investment income, fees on health insurance providers, a \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, a fee on branded drugs, and a cellulosic biofuel credit. These provisions account for about 90% of revenues, with shares changing over time due to delays and expirations. In 2019, the Medicare tax is the largest revenue raiser at 44%, followed by the Cadillac tax at 22%. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue provisions for health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation like H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 were passed to fund health care reform, with modifications to revenue raisers. The main changes involved a surtax revision and additional revenue raisers, resulting in $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The initial proposal for funding health care reform in H.R. 3200 included a surtax on individual taxpayers, generating $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The surtax rates ranged from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels, with potential adjustments in 2013. Additional revenue raisers were also proposed, including changes to medical expense deductions and measures to address international taxation and tax evasion. The plan in H.R. 3962 included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, a provision to address tax sheltering by corporations, and an expansion of the definition of dependents for health-related tax purposes. Additionally, a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint returns and half that amount for single taxpayers was proposed, along with other revenue raisers, totaling $460.5 billion over the FY2010-FY2014 period. The revenue raisers in H.R. 3962 include provisions related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, penalties for underpayments, and restrictions on health-related tax provisions. These measures are estimated to raise billions of dollars in revenue. The revenue raisers in H.R. 3962 include provisions related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a tax on the sale of medical devices and information reporting on payments to corporations. Other provisions involve extending health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on insured and self-insured health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. These measures are estimated to raise significant revenue. The Finance Committee bill and final version of H.R. 3962 included provisions on a surtax targeting high-income individuals, affecting a small percentage of taxpayers. Concerns were raised about the impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship. Approximately 4% of businesses would be affected initially, with 1.2% of unincorporated businesses paying the revised surtax. Higher-income individuals would be more affected due to their larger share of income. Higher-income individuals, particularly those with incomes over $1 million, would be significantly impacted by the revised surtax. These individuals account for a large share of income, with statistics showing that they contribute a substantial portion of adjusted gross income. Business income is also heavily concentrated in higher-income levels, with individuals earning over $1 million representing a significant portion of unincorporated business net income. This concentration is primarily seen in partnership and Subchapter S firms rather than proprietorships. Businesses and individuals with incomes over $500,000 account for 39% of total income, with higher concentrations in partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with income over $1 million make up 7.5% of proprietorship income and 49% of net income for partnerships and Subchapter S firms. A 2007 Treasury study found that taxpayers at the top tax rate contribute 61% of business flow-through income. Partnership income is mostly in limited liability companies or limited partnerships, indicating passive income involvement. The Treasury study indicated that high-income taxpayers at the top tax rate contribute 61% of business flow-through income, with partnership income mostly involving passive activities in limited liability companies or partnerships. Only 46% of active positive business income comes from these taxpayers, and only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax have business income exceeding half of total income. This suggests that much of the income is passive investment income that would otherwise be in the form of corporate dividends and capital gains. The Treasury study shows that high-income taxpayers contribute a significant portion of business income, with partnerships mainly involving passive activities. Most small business income is associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, rather than innovators or job creators for lower-income individuals. Small businesses create more jobs but also have higher job loss rates. Small businesses are the main source of job creation but also experience high job loss rates. While they offer more opportunities to women and minorities, the jobs they provide are lower paying, less stable, and have fewer benefits. There is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs as the economy naturally generates employment over time. Excluding certain types of business income from a surcharge could mitigate the impact on small businesses. Passive income makes up a significant portion of the top 1%'s income, and excluding it could reduce revenue by around one-quarter. Excluding certain types of income from a surcharge could reduce revenue by around one-quarter, with passive income being a significant portion of the top 1%'s income. Other provisions in the bill have smaller revenue effects, such as disallowing spending on over-the-counter medications in tax-favored plans. Some health-related provisions are implemented earlier in the Senate bill, while the tax on medical devices is also included. The House and Senate bills both include a tax on medical devices, with differences in the form of the tax. The House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, while the Senate bill imposes a fixed fee. The tax is intended to raise revenue from health-related provisions, with costs likely passed on to consumers. The tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills will lead to higher insurance payments for consumers. The tax may discourage investment in new devices and repeal a provision for worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. The 2004 provision increased allowable foreign tax credits by including interest on foreign borrowing and debt-financed investment in the calculation. It aimed to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. Another provision would codify the economic substance doctrine for tax savings arrangements. The third provision in H.R. 3962 would codify the economic substance doctrine, requiring transactions to meet both objective and subjective tests to prevent tax avoidance. Supporters believe this will create consistency in court rulings, while some tax attorneys are concerned it may provide a roadmap for passing the test. Additionally, the bill includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires information reporting on payments to corporations over $600 to aid in tax enforcement. Small businesses incorporating may pose compliance challenges. The change simplifies reporting by not requiring determination of corporate status. The provision also modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuel with high water, sediment, or ash content. The black liquor provision was removed from the cellulosic biofuels producer credit, which aimed to reduce fossil fuel use in the paper industry. Firms must report payments over $600 to unincorporated businesses under current law. Under current law, firms are required to report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year. The reporting aims to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Compliance rates for other types of income are higher. The proposal includes expanding reporting of payments to corporations to improve compliance. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to simplify compliance for small firms by including payments to both corporate and unincorporated businesses for goods and services. This change is expected to increase compliance and enforcement of income reporting, although businesses have criticized it for adding unnecessary costs and administrative burdens. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes provisions for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. The bill aims to raise $398.1 billion in revenue, with a significant portion coming from this tax. There are suggestions to scale back the reporting requirements to alleviate concerns about costs and administrative burdens. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, raises $398.1 billion through various provisions, including a 40% excise tax on high-cost health coverage. It also includes a fee reduction on medical devices, an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earners, and other revenue-raising measures related to health issues. Additionally, the bill introduces temporary fees on insured and self-insured plans, liberalizes the adoption credit, and excludes certain assistance for health professionals in state student loan repayment programs. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, includes provisions such as a 40% excise tax on high-cost health coverage, fee reduction on medical devices, payroll tax increase for high-income earners, and temporary fees on insured and self-insured plans. The House bill proposes changes to medical expenses for health savings accounts, limits on health flexible spending arrangements, penalties for nonqualified distributions, and deductions for subsidies related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, it includes provisions to raise the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs, limit deductions for remuneration to health insurance providers, and impose fees on manufacturers, importers of medical devices, and health insurance providers. The proposal includes fees on manufacturers and importers of medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities. It also imposes an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on high-income earners. Other provisions include requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on health benefits, and a safe harbor for small employers. There are also revenue losing provisions such as a therapeutic discovery project credit and exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs. The curr_chunk discusses the adoption tax credit, excise tax on health insurance coverage, fees on drugs and medical devices, and the impact on insurance companies and employers. The excise tax rate is comparable to the top income tax rate and may lead to higher premiums or reduced benefits for high-income taxpayers. The excise tax provision in the curr_chunk would increase premiums or reduce benefits for high-income individuals, potentially leading to higher prices for medical care and lower demand. It is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, with thresholds for the tax being adjusted based on inflation. Certain exceptions, such as for individuals over 55 or in risky professions, would have higher thresholds of $9,850 for single plans and $26,000 for family plans. The excise tax provision aims to discourage rising healthcare costs by imposing taxes on high-income individuals with health insurance coverage exceeding certain thresholds. The tax would lead to increased premiums or reduced benefits, potentially affecting medical care prices and demand. Exceptions exist for individuals over 55 or in risky professions, with thresholds set at $8,000 and $21,000. The tax is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, with adjustments for inflation. The excise tax provision aims to reduce healthcare costs by taxing high-income individuals with excessive health insurance coverage. This tax could lead to increased premiums or reduced benefits, affecting medical care prices and demand. Exceptions are made for individuals over 55 or in risky professions, with revenue estimated at $148.9 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3590 proposes increasing the HI payroll tax by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single persons and $250,000 for joint returns, generating $86.8 billion in revenue. Questions remain on how self-insured firms would be treated and if the excise tax would be deductible from the firm's income tax. The provision aims to tax high-income individuals with excessive health insurance coverage, raising revenue from high-income taxpayers. The fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices account for significant revenue, with fees increasing over time. The provision is progressive but does not target capital income. The provision includes fees on branded drugs, insured and self-insured plans, and medical devices to raise revenue. These fees are designed to finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund and may impact prices, profits, and development in the healthcare industry. The fees are fixed and collected based on sales shares, with exemptions for certain low-cost medical devices. The medical device fee exempts devices under $100, with sliding scales for small producers. For drugs, fees are based on sales shares. Insurance premiums and third-party administrator fees also have exclusions. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment. H.R. 3590 imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, generating $2.7 billion over 10 years. There was discussion about taxing cosmetic producers, but it was not included in the final bill. The tax is in the form of a standard excise tax, potentially borne by consumers or absorbed by providers. Hospitals classified as charitable organizations receive tax exemptions and other benefits under current law. Nonprofit hospitals classified as charitable organizations receive tax exemptions and benefits, based on meeting a \"community benefit\" standard. Concerns arise regarding the level of charity care provided and whether the benefits justify their tax-exempt status. Studies show that nonprofit hospitals provide slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals, with federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals estimated at $6 billion in 2002. Congressional committees have held hearings on the topic, including the Senate Finance Committee in 2006 and the House Ways and Means Committee in 2005. Senator Grassley released a staff discussion draft in 2007 on the issue. The House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on \"The Tax Exempt Hospital Sector\" in May 2005. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals' charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices in a staff discussion draft released in July 2007. An IRS report in July 2007 found that the median share of revenues spent on charity care by nonprofit hospitals was 3.9%. Nonprofit hospitals have not been required to demonstrate specific charity care standards since a 1969 revenue ruling. The proposal aims to establish rules for determining charitable status for tax-exempt organizations, including a community needs standard and minimum annual charitable patient care. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow for tax reductions to fund program benefits, with options for raising revenue by limiting contributions or eliminating them. Concerns include the \"use it or lose it\" nature of FSAs. The House and Senate bills propose limiting contributions to flexible spending accounts (FSAs) to $2,500 and indexing the amounts by the CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not eligible for tax deductions above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, but are covered under health savings accounts. Individuals can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of income, with an estimated cost of $10.7 billion per year. The Senate bills propose allowing individuals to deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, costing $10.7 billion per year. This provision benefits taxpayers with high medical costs relative to income, especially those without insurance or for uncovered expenses like mental health care. It is utilized by about 12 million taxpayers, primarily benefiting middle-class taxpayers compared to other deductions. The deduction is less claimed by higher-income groups, encouraging individuals to forego insurance and has an uneven subsidy effect depending on the tax. The Senate bill proposes increasing the floor for deducting medical expenses to 10%, with exceptions for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. This provision results in a revenue loss of about $1 billion annually and was introduced in 1986 to replace a general tax exemption for these organizations. In 1986, tax exemptions for Blue Cross and Blue Shield were removed due to their activities being similar to commercial insurance. The Blues still offer specialized and community rates, benefiting shareholders. A Senate proposal aims to disallow tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal in 2010, modifying revenue provisions of a bill by delaying a high-cost health insurance plan tax to 2018 and raising exemption amounts. The proposal also broadens the Medicare HI tax to offset revenue losses. The Obama Administration's compromise proposal in 2010 modified revenue provisions by delaying a tax on high-cost health insurance plans to 2018 and raising exemption amounts. To offset revenue losses, the proposal broadened the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers. Specifically, the proposal included a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate to 2.35% for married couples earning over $250,000 and individuals earning over $200,000. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on certain types of unearned income was proposed for high-income earners. The President's proposal in 2010 aimed to codify the economic substance doctrine and included changes to tax provisions. The reduction in tax on high-cost insurance and the additional Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers' investment income were key components. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872, with the Senate considering the latter. Health insurance benefits paid by firms for employees are excluded from wages and taxes, including contributions to health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. The exclusion of health insurance benefits from taxable income, including contributions to health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts, has been a topic of discussion in various proposals. The employer exclusion, which is the largest health-related income tax benefit, has been considered for capping to find health-related financing options. The revenue loss from this exclusion was estimated to be significant, with additional tax revenue losses from the exclusion of benefits from the payroll tax. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated significant tax revenue losses from the exclusion of health insurance benefits from taxable income, including contributions to health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. The revenue effect of capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs was estimated at $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continuing to rise. A cap on health benefits could recover only part of the revenue lost from the tax exemption related to income and payroll taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimated significant revenue losses from excluding health insurance benefits from taxable income. A cap on health benefits at the 90th percentile could raise $4.9 billion in 2010, increasing to $188.8 billion in 2019 if not indexed. Indexing caps to health price inflation is crucial for maintaining a steady revenue stream. The subsidy for health insurance benefits favors high-income employees, leading to increased demand for healthcare and higher healthcare costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from the tax advantages of employer health insurance, with every dollar of excluded income in the highest bracket saving $0.35 in income taxes. Payroll-tax exclusion benefits are less targeted towards higher-income families due to flat rate taxes and income caps on Social Security taxes. Excluded income from health insurance benefits does not rise with income in group plans. The tax benefit from employer health insurance does not rise with income in group plans, making it proportional to income across much of the population. Repealing the tax benefit may not necessarily be progressive, with higher burdens on middle-income brackets. A cap related to income would lead to a different distribution of tax effects. A cap related to income would lead to a different distribution of tax effects from repealing the exclusion of employer health insurance benefits. The exclusion has been supported to reduce adverse selection in the health care market and concerns exist about altering or reducing tax subsidies affecting employer participation. Imposing a cap on the exclusion of employer health insurance benefits could address issues with tax benefits and coverage without significantly affecting coverage. However, determining includable income for tax purposes could lead to inequities and administrative burdens. The true economic costs of health insurance for employees vary based on factors like geographic location, family size, age, and health status. Employer plans involve implicit cost shifting, with characteristics of the group affecting premiums for firms that purchase insurance and claims for firms that self-insure. Varying employer insurance benefits by factors like family size, age, and location is legitimate, but not consistent with risk-sharing. Imposing income imputations that do not vary with age may discourage younger individuals from participating. Not varying imputed income by age could result in inequities across employees due to differing average premiums. Imputed income from health benefits may create inequities based on factors like age, gender, and workforce health. Adjustments for these characteristics could add to administrative burden. Options include setting benefits under COBRA rules or reformulating the exclusion as a deduction or credit to equalize treatment across taxpayers. The exclusion of health benefits could be reformed as a deduction, credit, or a combination. Credits would equalize treatment across taxpayers, while restricting deductions for employers could simplify benefit allocation. This approach would also generate revenue and discourage overly generous insurance packages. Other health-related tax expenditures were considered by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate Finance Committee's report listed various tax expenditures, including the second-largest one for Medicare benefits at $40.6 billion. Exclusions for military dependents and retirees were not included. Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for medical expenses. HSAs cost about $0.5 billion per year, expected to grow. They help individuals cover catastrophic costs but not routine expenses, reducing the incentive for unnecessary spending. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting individual contributions to HSAs under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses. Distributions from HSAs would only be tax-exempt for medical expenses verified by an employer or third party. Proposals also include capping employer HSA contributions. The uncertainty surrounding FICA tax exceptions for students, particularly medical residents, has been a topic of debate. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify FICA tax exceptions for medical residents, extend Medicare coverage to all state and local employees, and increase HI taxes to finance Medicare. Additionally, the proposal discusses potential excise tax provisions on alcoholic and sugared beverages. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes potential excise tax provisions on alcoholic beverages, with different tax rates for distilled spirits, beer, and wine. Alcohol taxes are levied per unit and their real value falls over time due to inflation, with the last revision in 1991. The last revision of alcohol taxes was in 1991, with a $13.50 per gallon rate on distilled spirits. If adjusted for inflation, it would be around $19.60 currently. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, have similar issues and consequences for health costs. Studies show that the external costs of alcohol exceed current taxes, and consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes. Alcohol taxes, similar to tobacco taxes, are regressive, impacting low-income individuals more. Distributional data on federal excise taxes is outdated, with the latest from a 1990 study. Table 2 displays expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, are regressive, impacting low-income individuals more due to the higher burden on lower income classes. The regressivity of alcohol taxes is exacerbated by the fact that higher income classes tend to purchase more expensive alcohols, leading to a disproportionate impact on lower income groups. The unit tax nature of excise taxes makes them more regressive than sales taxes, with the burden relative to income being significantly larger for lower income classes. The proposal aims to increase alcohol taxes to address the regressive nature of current tax rates. This includes raising taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with projected revenue increases of $5.7 billion per year. The current federal alcohol taxes collect $9.4 billion in revenues, with the proposed changes leading to significant tax increases for wine and beer. The proposal aims to increase alcohol taxes, including raising taxes on beer by 148% or $5 billion, to generate $5.7 billion in revenue per year. Price elasticity estimates suggest a modest decrease in consumption, with beer prices rising by 5%, wine by 8.1%, and spirits by 1.5%. This would result in a 0.8% decrease in beer consumption, a 4.7% decrease in wine consumption, and a 0.6% decrease in spirits consumption. The proposal includes a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates suggesting it could raise $1.5 billion per year with a one cent per 12-ounce can tax, or $17 billion with a one cent per ounce tax. The tax is likely regressive and some question singling out this particular food source, as other unhealthy items could also be taxed. Individual taxpayers can choose between a standard deduction or itemizing deductions, which include taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses, and casualty losses. The largest deductions are for mortgage interest and taxes, with income taxes and property taxes being the most common. President Obama's tax proposals aim to cap itemized deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%. This could generate around $25 billion in revenue when fully effective in FY2012. After 2010, tax rates are set to increase to 36% and 39.5%. The proposal targets high-income taxpayers, affecting those with incomes over $250,000. The top tax rate will be 39.6% when the 2001 tax cuts expire. The provision is expected to raise about $25 billion in revenue by FY2012, primarily impacting the top 2% of incomes. The $500,000-and-above class accounts for a small percentage of mortgage interest and property tax deductions, but a significant portion of charitable contributions deductions. Studies suggest a modest 1% reduction in charitable giving due to the proposed limit on deductions. Excluding charitable deductions from the cap could reduce expected revenue gain by one-quarter. Charitable giving is a primary concern in tax provisions, with proposed deductions potentially excluded from a cap, sacrificing a quarter of expected revenue gain. Various commentators suggest significant restrictions on itemized deductions, such as limiting all deductions to 15%, projected to raise $141 billion in 2011. President Obama's proposals include base-broadening provisions dedicated to financing health care reform, resulting in about $1 billion of revenue gain. Additional provisions target tax compliance and gap reduction, while narrow revisions in financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax could raise $5 to $6 billion per year. The second set of provisions in the estate tax focuses on limiting valuation discounts, raising around $5 to $6 billion annually. Key provisions include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of certain inventory valuation methods. Other income tax provisions like rate increases and base expansion could generate additional revenues. Suggestions include reducing the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% to address cost of living changes. The proposal suggests revising the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% to address cost of living changes, estimated to raise significant revenue. Other revenue-raising measures include increasing the capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, international tax enforcement reforms, and repealing LIFO inventories. These measures are projected to generate billions in revenue, with potential for growth over time. The President's proposal includes various revenue-raising measures such as increasing payroll taxes, eliminating the Social Security earnings cap, implementing a value-added tax (VAT), and considering a carbon tax. These measures could potentially raise over $700 billion in revenue annually, but implementing a new tax like VAT may come with administrative challenges and compliance costs. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system may be challenging due to administration and compliance costs, as well as transition and program issues. These taxes could also be regressive. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590 with those enacted in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
