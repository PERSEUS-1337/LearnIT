    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, providing consumers with information on how their food is made. Congress recognizes the need for labeling due to material changes in genetically engineered food, the right of individuals to know how their food is produced, and the existence of similar laws in over 60 countries. The Codex Alimentarius adopted a text in 2011 allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of such foods can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are proposed. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include a new section requiring clear disclosure of genetically engineered foods, with exceptions for certain types of food. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving in vitro nucleic acid techniques. The term 'genetic engineering' involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques and fusion of cells beyond taxonomic family to overcome natural barriers. 'Genetically engineered' food is produced intentionally using genetic engineering techniques. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular changes or suitability for human consumption. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include provisions regarding misbranded food violations. The recipient of misbranded food can avoid penalties by providing a guaranty signed by a US resident stating the food is not genetically engineered. This exclusion applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The recipient of misbranded food can avoid penalties by providing a guaranty stating the food is not genetically engineered, regardless of how the food is used. No person can shift responsibility for misbranded food violations to another party through contracts. Section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to exempt agricultural producers from penalties for misbranded food contamination with genetically engineered material. The Secretary must establish labeling requirements for genetically engineered material contamination in food within one year of the Act's enactment."
