    "content": "The United States, Iraq's neighbors, and Iraqi political groups have different views and interests regarding Iraq's future. Iraq's neighbors are focused on influencing changes in regional strategic balance, sectarian violence, terrorist groups, refugees, and economic opportunities. The removal of Saddam Hussein upset the political and economic balance in the Persian Gulf region, impacting long-term relations with neighbors. The fall of the regime in Iraq removed a military threat to Arab Gulf states but also weakened a strategic counterweight to Iran. The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has friendly ties to Iranian interests. The end of U.N. sanctions in Iraq created new economic opportunities, but ongoing violence limits growth. Postwar trends in Iraq, such as ethnic and sectarian divisions, challenge central government authority and worry regional powers. The U.S. no longer needs a containment policy towards Iraq, leading to changes in military posture and focus on stabilization, counterterrorism, and potential confrontation with Iran. The fall of Saddam's regime in Iraq shifted the focus of the U.S. military presence in the region towards stabilization, training, and countering terrorism. The rise of sectarian tensions in Iraq has caused concern among neighboring countries, with some Sunni Arab governments viewing the empowerment of Iraqi Shiite Arabs and their ties to Iran as a potential threat. The sectarian violence in Iraq has regional implications, with Sunni Arabs in neighboring countries accusing Iraqi Shiite militia groups of targeting Sunni civilians. Similarly, Shiites outside of Iraq are concerned about the targeting of Iraqi Shiite civilians by Sunni-led insurgent groups. Turkish concerns about Kurdish separatism and the fate of Iraq's Turkoman minority drive Turkish policy towards Iraq. The strengthening of Iraqi Shiite political parties and the Shiite hawza in An Najaf also impact regional dynamics, with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain worried about the political activism of indigenous Shiite Arabs. Sectarian tension in Bahrain and scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority population add to regional complexities. Iraq-based clerics in An Najaf may challenge the religious authority of Iran's hawza in Qom. Concerns persist among Iraq's neighbors about terrorism due to the country's security progress and the presence of transnational terrorist organizations. Al Qaeda in Iraq, under Abu Musab al Zarqawi, created a sophisticated network responsible for attacks in Iraq and Jordan. The potential for Iraq to be exploited by terrorist organizations remains a concern for regional stability. The Iraqi and regional terrorist network, including groups like PMOI/MEK/MKO, PJAK, and PKK, pose transnational threats to Turkey and Iran. Concerns also exist about foreign fighters in Iraq potentially causing regional instability. Recent research has found that experienced \"Afghan Arab\" fighters played a key role in the formation of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Efforts are needed to prevent the reverse flow of foreign volunteers from Iraq to other regions, as the conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis with millions of displaced Iraqis. Iraq's neighbors are under pressure to assist both Iraqi refugees and those displaced within Iraq. Iraq's neighbors are urged to assist Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. Strong religious and ethnic ties drive calls for greater involvement. The United Nations calls for a coordinated relief response, as the potential for renewed civil conflict in Iraq looms. Iraq's energy resources and strategic location make it an attractive economic partner, but post-war challenges hinder full trade and investment potential. Iraq's neighbors face limitations in expanding trade and investment due to commercial laws and regulations. Despite increased trade levels, violence hinders investment opportunities. The rehabilitation of Iraq's oil infrastructure is expected to impact global energy markets. The diverse political landscape in Iraq complicates predicting future events. Changes in U.S. policy and regional circumstances have influenced the perspectives and policies of Iraq's neighbors. Since 2003, circumstances in Iraq and the region have evolved, impacting the perspectives and policies of Iraq's neighbors. The violence between Sunni and Shiite communities escalated after the bombing of a Shiite mosque in Al Samarra in 2006, leading to concerns of a civil war. U.S. efforts in 2007 aimed to reduce sectarian and ethnic violence, affecting security goals. Since 2007, U.S. forces worked to reduce sectarian violence in Iraq, with a significant drop attributed to the troop surge and ceasefire of the Shiite militia. Iran and Turkey have engaged with Iraqi populations to protect their interests, potentially fueling Sunni resistance and Kurdish concerns. This could lead to pressure on Iraq's neighbors to intervene based on sectarian or ethnic affiliations. Iraq's Kurds are wary of Turkish intentions due to ongoing military operations against the PKK in northern Iraq. Members of Congress may consider potential U.S. responses to neighboring countries influencing Iraq. Sunni Arab neighbors have limited engagement with Iraq, fearing chaos and terrorist elements. Arab citizens are divided on the U.S. military presence in Iraq, with some viewing the government as illegitimate. Reconciling these differing opinions will be a challenge. The Bush and Obama Administrations claimed success in improving security in Iraq through troop surge strategies and agreements. U.S. troops have withdrawn from Iraqi cities, with further withdrawals planned after the 2010 elections. Reconciling differing opinions on the Iraqi government's legitimacy remains a challenge. The U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq is now complete, with plans for further reductions to 35,000-50,000 troops by August 31, 2010. The Obama Administration aims for a full withdrawal by December 31, 2011, focusing on support and training roles for Iraqi security forces. Critics argue that political reconciliation in Iraq remains elusive despite improved security conditions. The U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq is complete, with plans for further reductions. Political reconciliation in Iraq remains elusive despite improved security conditions. Iraq's neighbors have differing perspectives on the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq. The United States and Iraq's neighbors are seeking to influence the future stability and unity of Iraq. Iraq's neighbors may support a strong central government in Iraq and oppose federal arrangements that could weaken local security. Analysts believe a united, democratic Iraq could pressure neighboring countries to improve political rights. Reconciliation is needed on issues like Iraq's role in OPEC, military projection, and the presence of foreign military bases. Iraq's neighbors may support a strong central government in Iraq and oppose federal arrangements that could weaken local security. Analysts believe a united, democratic Iraq could pressure neighboring countries to improve political rights. Reconciliation is needed on issues like Iraq's role in OPEC, military projection, and the presence of foreign military bases. The profiles below seek to define the key interests of Iraq's neighbors, review their diplomatic engagement and trade with Iraq, and discuss their perspectives on Iraq's future in light of regional and international issues. Iran's interests in Iraq revolve around regional ambitions, nuclear technology development, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. They aim to prevent Iraq from posing a threat to Iran and view Iraq's Shiite population as a strategic asset. Iran supports Iraqi Shiite parties to maintain control and influence in Iraq, which has sometimes conflicted with U.S. efforts to stabilize the region. Iran's aid to Iraqi Shiite parties has hindered U.S. efforts in Iraq. Iran faces challenges as Shiite factions compete. Iran's strategy in Iraq led to Shiite dominance in government. The UIA had the support of Moqtada al Sadr's faction until 2007 when they withdrew due to US pressure. Nouri al Maliki, from the Dawa Party, is the current Prime Minister. ISCI is considered the most pro-Iranian Shiite political group in Iraq. Sadr faction has ties to Iran, with ideological connections. Maliki is seen as less pro-Iranian than ISCI or Sadr, representing a setback for Iran in the 2009 elections. The January 31, 2009 elections in Iraq were a setback for Iran as Nouri al Maliki's slate outperformed ISCI in the Shiite south, winning in most provinces including Baghdad and Basra. This limited ISCI's ability to form coalitions and determine provincial governors. The U.S. Defense Department report noted that Iraqi nationalism could check Iran's ambitions, despite Tehran reducing support for militants. The report highlighted Iran's reduced support for militants but improved training and weapons systems for proxy militants. Despite this, Iran still poses a significant challenge to Iraq's stability and political independence. Iran continues to support Sadr's religious studies in Qom, Iran. Political developments suggest that Maliki's faction may also be pro-Iranian, impacting Iran's influence in Iraq. Iraqi nationalism since 2007 has reduced Iraq's willingness to compromise with Iran on longstanding disputes. In July 2005, Iraqi officials took responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war, signed military cooperation agreements with Iran, and allowed Iranian consulates in several Iraqi cities. Iraq's Foreign Minister supported Iran's right to nuclear technology in 2006. Iran has not returned Iraqi aircraft taken during the Gulf War. The ICRC is working to resolve missing persons from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran accuses Iraq of not doing enough to combat a Kurdish militant group. In 2009, tensions between Iran and Iraq arose due to Iran's accusation that Iraq is not taking action against a Kurdish separatist group. The two countries have resolved territorial disputes in the past, including recognizing the thalweg as the water border. Iraq urged Iran to finalize border demarcations in 2009. Iranian foot-dragging has led to ambiguity favoring Iran in resolving the issue at Camp Ashraf near the Iraq-Iran border. Iran is pressuring Iraqi leaders to expel the Iranian opposition group PMOI from Iraq, possibly extraditing its members to Iran. Despite Iraqi leaders' resentment towards PMOI's ties to Saddam, they had pledged to respect the residents' human rights and not force them out before the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement took effect in 2009. The State Department stated in December 2008 that Iraqi leaders had pledged to respect the human rights of Camp Ashraf residents and not expel them. In July 2009, the ISF tried to assert control over Ashraf, leading to clashes with unarmed PMOI residents. The U.S. considers the issue of Camp Ashraf an Iraqi matter, while Iran seeks to influence outcomes in Iraq through close ties with Iraqi leaders. Iranian leaders opposed the Iraq-U.S. pact, fearing U.S. influence in Iraq and Iran's encirclement. Iran reportedly tried to sabotage the agreement by bribing Iraqi parliamentarians. Despite the pact, Iran's Supreme Leader warned Iraq about trusting the U.S. Iran has welcomed Iraqi leaders' positions on diplomatic disputes and Maliki has visited Iran multiple times for consultations and agreements. On various occasions between 2007 and 2009, Iran and Iraq reached agreements on pipelines, mine clearance, electricity purchases, and cooperation in various sectors. Ahmadinejad's visit to Iraq in 2008 resulted in $1 billion in credits for Iranian exports and seven cooperation agreements. Iran had previously provided kerosene to Iraq, and in 2009, Iraq reciprocated with generosity towards Iran. In 2005, Iran agreed to provide 2 million liters per day of kerosene to Iraqis. In February 2009, the Iraqi government awarded a $1 billion contract to an Iranian firm to help rebuild Basra and repair ancient Persian historical sites in southern Iraq. Trade relations have burgeoned, with the two countries conducting about $4 billion in bilateral trade as of the beginning of 2009. Plans were made to increase trade to $5 billion annually through oil- and electricity-related trade. The United States agreed to bilateral meetings with Iran in Baghdad in 2007, led by respective ambassadors, to discuss the Iraq issue. Iran and the United States engaged in bilateral meetings in Baghdad in 2007, led by Ambassador Kazemi-Qomi. Talks were held in 2007 and 2008, but Iran eventually decided to discontinue the dialogue due to civilian casualties caused by U.S. forces in Sadr City. The Iranian government may have believed that as the U.S. finalized its withdrawal plans from Iraq, it did not need to make concessions to the United States. This decision could be influenced by the perception of a diminishing U.S. influence in Iraq and the potential threat posed by U.S. forces. Iran's clerical leadership may fear the emergence of a strong Arab nationalist leader in Iraq, which could pose challenges for Iran. Iran's influence in Iraq remains substantial, but some aspects are waning, particularly efforts to sustain Shiite militias. Analysts believe Iran fears a successful non-cleric-led democracy in Iraq, which could increase pressure for political liberalization in Iran. A stable Iraq may help An Najaf reassert itself, potentially challenging Iran's holy city of Qom. Some experts predict Iran's influence will fade as Iraq asserts its nationhood and the security situation improves. Some experts predict that Iran's influence in Iraq is waning as the security situation improves and Arab-Persian differences reemerge. Turkey's relationship with Iraq has evolved over the years, with concerns about Kurdish separatism and Saddam Hussein's regime defining their interactions. Turkey allowed US and British planes to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq after the Gulf War, despite initial unease. Turkish leaders expressed doubts about US regime change plans for Iraq before the 2003 invasion. Turkey desires a stable, democratic, and unified Iraq with territorial integrity, fearing Iranian control over a Shiite-dominated Iraq. They advocate for reconciliation among Iraqi parties and support the federal structure, emphasizing the importance of Kurdish involvement. Turkey also prioritizes the well-being of Iraqi Turkomen and aims to strengthen bilateral relations. Turkey's interest in Iraq extends to supporting regional stability and reducing tensions between Iraq and Syria. They prioritize Iraq's territorial integrity to prevent the emergence of an independent Kurdish state that could inspire separatist movements within Turkey. Turkey has a history of conflict with the PKK, listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State Department lists the Kongra-Gel(KGK)/PKK as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). Turkey has deployed military forces into northern Iraq to combat the PKK threat and has engaged in diplomacy with Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish officials. Ankara maintains its right to defend itself if Iraq cannot stop terrorists from using its territory against Turkey. In response to the PKK presence in northern Iraq, Turkey mobilized military forces on the border in 2006. The Bush Administration appointed retired General Joseph Ralston as Special Envoy for Countering the PKK to coordinate with Turkey and Iraq to eliminate the PKK threat. Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), appointed as Special Envoy for Countering the PKK, failed to achieve concrete results in coordinating with Turkey and Iraq to eliminate the PKK threat. His resignation in October 2007 followed a year of preventing Turkey from acting against the PKK. Turkish military actions in 2007 were limited to operations within southeast Turkey and \"hot pursuit\" raids in northern Iraq. Ankara later opened a diplomatic track with Iraq, signing a memorandum of understanding on countering terrorism. On August 7, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki visited Ankara to sign a memorandum of understanding on countering terrorism, including the PKK. However, the MOU needed parliamentary approval and cooperation from the Kurdistan Regional Government. Turkey refused to engage with the KRG due to President Barzani's support for the PKK. After PKK attacks in 2007, Turkish forces massed on the border, leading President Bush to invite Prime Minister Erdogan to the White House for intelligence sharing and consultations. After consultations with US and Turkish military leaders, Turkish forces conducted targeted air strikes against the PKK in 2008. A week-long incursion into Iraq's Zap area degraded PKK facilities, with US intelligence assistance. Turkish President invited Iraqi President for talks to ease tensions. President Abdullah Gul invited Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to Ankara on March 7, 2008, to address tensions. Talabani, a Kurd, labeled the PKK as a terrorist group but urged non-military solutions. Prime Minister Erdogan visited Iraq on July 10, 2008, establishing a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council. In March 2009, President Gul visited Iraq, meeting with Talabani and KRG Prime Minister Barzani to discuss PKK actions. Despite diplomatic efforts, Turkey continues to face PKK attacks, including a deadly assault in October 2008. In October 2008, the PKK carried out deadly attacks in Turkey, prompting Turkey to respond with air strikes and extend authority for cross-border operations. Despite this, diplomatic efforts were made with Massoud Barzani, leading to optimism for future relations. Massoud Barzani also discouraged armed struggle by the PKK and encouraged peaceful means to demand rights. On October 6, 2009, the Turkish parliament extended the mandate for another year, emphasizing security cooperation with Iraq. The High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council aims to establish a common security framework, political dialogue, economic interdependence, and cultural cooperation. Ankara is concerned about the Iraqi Turkomen's displacement and outnumbering by returning Kurds. Ankara sympathizes with Turkomen complaints of being displaced and outnumbered by Iraqi Kurds in the north, especially in Kirkuk, a city claimed by the Kurds. Turkey advocates postponing a referendum on Kirkuk's fate to ensure equitable sharing of resources among all Iraqis. Turkish unease has somewhat lessened with the postponement of the referendum and a national census, but they remain vigilant. Turkey has taken advantage of economic opportunities in post-Saddam Iraq, with plans to increase trade to $20 billion by 2011. There are daily truck crossings with Iraqi Kurds collecting tariffs, and plans for a common industrial zone on the border. Bilateral cooperation in the energy field is also growing, with agreements in oil exploration and operation in northern Iraq. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline benefits both countries economically. Turkey and Iraq have growing bilateral cooperation in the energy field, with plans to rehabilitate oil fields in Basra and increase oil pipeline capacity. There are also discussions about using the Nabucco natural gas pipeline for Iraqi gas exports to Europe. Water issues between the two countries are sometimes problematic due to Turkey's control of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Iraq has water issues with Turkey due to the control of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. In 2009, Iraq claimed a decrease in water flow from the Euphrates, but Turkey maintained its commitment to provide water. A memorandum of understanding was signed to establish joint measurement stations on both rivers. Turkey has diplomatic presence in Iraq and plans for further consulates. Ankara is responsible for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, with plans for consulates in Mosul, Basra, and Irbil. Despite past attacks, Turkey maintains its embassy in Baghdad. Turkish authorities aim for unity among Iraqi ethnic groups and have improved relations with Iran and Syria. Turkey has improved ties with Iran and Syria and consults them regularly about Iraq. Kurdish and other media reports allege Turkish military cooperation with Iranians against the PKK and PJAK in northern Iraq. Turkish officials emphasize multilateral contact groups involving all of Iraq's neighbors, including Syria and Iran. Public attitudes towards the United States have improved since President Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Erdogan in 2007, U.S. intelligence support for Turkish military operations against the PKK, and President Obama's visit to Turkey in 2009, despite conflicting public opinion polls. Public opinion polls in Turkey do not support the conclusion that President Obama's visit in 2009 improved favorability towards the United States. A Pew survey showed only a 14% favorability rating, largely due to U.S. policies towards Muslim-majority countries like Iraq. Despite this, Turkey is likely to support the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and has indicated willingness to assist via its Incirlik Air Base and port of Mercin, with the condition that arms do not fall into the hands of the PKK. Saudi Arabia's historical relationship with Iraq has been tense, but periods of cooperation have occurred based on shared interests. Saudi Arabia has had a historically tense relationship with Iraq, but there have been periods of cooperation based on shared interests. Saudi Arabia's main concerns regarding Iraq are preventing instability, protecting Sunni Muslims, and limiting Iran's influence. They also aim to ensure their dominance in global energy markets and prevent Iraq from becoming a military threat. Despite the threat of instability in Iraq, Saudi Arabia has refrained from direct intervention since 2003. Saudi Arabia has refrained from direct political or military intervention in Iraq since 2003. Their initiatives focus on humanitarian aid for displaced Iraqis, promoting reconciliation, and preventing violence from spreading into Saudi Arabia. There are speculations about Saudi support for Sunni groups in Iraq, but challenges remain in controlling support from influential clerics and citizens. The challenge of young Saudi citizens offering support to combatants in Iraq persists. Official Saudi clerics have declared such actions as illegitimate and not religiously sanctioned. Saudis traveling to Iraq to fight alongside foreign fighters pose a long-term security risk for both countries. U.S. military assessments suggest that Saudi efforts to control exit visas have led to a decline in such activities. Saudi efforts to control exit visas have led to a decline in the number of Saudi fighters reaching Iraq. Estimates of Saudi fighters in Iraq remain imprecise, with reports indicating that 30 to 40 Saudis were traveling to Iraq each month. To prevent the return of Saudi volunteers, Saudi officials are implementing a $2 billion border security improvement program along the borders with Yemen and Iraq. Saudi Arabia awarded a $2 billion contract to EADS to build a security system along its borders with Yemen and Iraq. Concerns about Iran's influence in the region and Sunni-Shiite tensions within Saudi Arabia have been heightened. Saudi Shiites have welcomed the empowerment of Iraq's Shiite Arabs, while some conservative Sunni Saudis view the Shiite minority as potentially disloyal. Sectarian clashes have occurred between Saudi Shiites and security forces, elevating Sunni-Shiite tensions on the domestic agenda. In 2009, Sunni-Shiite tensions in Saudi Arabia have been elevated, complicating efforts to engage with Iraq. Saudi leaders maintain contact with Iraqi officials, but there are frustrations over slow progress in relations. Iraqi Foreign Minister expressed concerns about the strained relations and efforts to correct them. Iraq maintains an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate in Jeddah. Saudi Arabia has expressed intentions to open an embassy in Baghdad, but security concerns have caused delays. The bombing of Iraqi government ministries in August 2009 further highlighted security issues. As of September 2009, a Saudi Embassy had not been opened in Baghdad. Debt forgiveness is a key issue in Iraqi-Saudi relations, with Iraq owing Saudi Arabia $9 billion from the Saddam Hussein era. Private Saudi firms hold an additional $19 billion in Iraqi debt. Discussions are ongoing regarding interest payments on the debt. Saudi Arabia has pledged financial support for Iraqi development projects and humanitarian aid, but trade between the two countries has been limited since 2003. Since 2003, trade between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been limited. The Saudi government refrains from overt interference in Iraq but there are reports of private Saudi support for anti-coalition activities. They are likely to avoid direct support for anti-government forces to avoid confrontation with the United States. However, influential figures in Saudi Arabia have called for political and security assistance to Iraq's Sunni Arab community. Saudi clerics have forbidden Saudis from traveling to Iraq. Saudi Arabia refrains from overt interference in Iraq but there are reports of private support for anti-coalition activities. Saudi clerics have forbidden Saudis from traveling to Iraq to fight, but popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian activity may remain strong. Prince Saud al Faisal has dismissed calls for direct involvement and stated that the Kingdom will stand at an equal distance from all Iraqi groups. Saudi officials remain frustrated with Prime Minister Al Maliki's anti-Sunni sectarian policy and close relationship with Iran. Reconciliation and stability in Iraq could ease Saudi fears of instability, but the reintegration of returning Saudi militants remains a concern. The outcome of reconciliation or conflict in Iraq and the leadership of Iraq's government will determine Saudi Arabia's concerns about Shiite empowerment and Iranian influence. Future Iraqi choices in energy and military policy will impact Iraqi-Saudi relations. Syria and Iraq were rivals, but the 2003 U.S. invasion disrupted their reconciliation process. Syrian opposition to the U.S. presence in Iraq hindered their ability to formulate a coherent Iraq policy. Syria improved its ties with the Iraqi government and various sectarian actors between 2007 and 2009, playing different sides of the Iraqi sectarian equation. Syrian-Iraqi relations further improved in 2009 due to stronger U.S.-Syrian ties, leading to discussions on tightening security along the Syrian-Iraqi border. Syrian officials have agreed to establish a tripartite committee with the US to monitor the Syrian-Iraqi border for security. They are willing to cooperate with the Obama Administration on Iraq and are optimistic about stability in the region. However, tensions still exist between Syria and Iraq, as seen in a diplomatic dispute following bombings in Baghdad in 2009. The August 2009 bombings in Baghdad killed nearly 100 people and were allegedly carried out by Al Qaeda operatives based in Syria with support from remnants of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party and Syrian intelligence. Despite improved Syrian-Iraqi relations, the Iraqi government accused Syria of involvement, leading to the recall of ambassadors from both countries. The US officials claim that Syria continues to harbor groups opposed to the Iraqi government, emphasizing the need for Syria to address border security and foreign fighter networks. Syria needs to address border security and foreign fighter networks transiting into Iraq to improve relations with Iraq. Despite detaining some AQI facilitators, Syria remains the primary gateway for foreign fighters entering Iraq. Speculations suggest Syria may be using these groups as leverage in negotiations with the US and Iraqi government. The Maliki government insists relations will only improve once Syria cracks down on foreign fighters and Al Qaeda in Iraq. The Maliki government insists that relations with Syria will only improve once Syria demonstrates greater resolve to limit the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and crack down on Al Qaeda in Iraq's Syrian network. Despite some Syrian cooperation along the border, reports indicate that Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials continue to operate inside Syria, facilitating personnel, arms, and funds to fighters in Iraq. The U.S. Treasury Department has designated Syrian-based individuals for supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq. Syria's harboring of Al Qaeda in Iraq and Baath party elements, along with lax border security, have strained Syrian-Iraqi relations. The Iraqi government initially supported a U.S. air strike in Syrian territory that killed an Al Qaeda operative, leading to condemnation from Syria. Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari emphasized the need for security coordination with Syria. Minister Hoshyar Zebari visited Syria to address security concerns and received assurances from President Asad regarding professional discussions. The Syrian government demanded provisions in the U.S.-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement to prevent raids from Iraqi bases. The strained relations were exacerbated by Al Qaeda bomb attacks in Iraq, leading to accusations against the Asad regime. Diplomatic tensions escalated between Syrian and Iraqi leaders following the accusations. The accusations damaged the diplomatic relationship between Syria and Iraq, following recent breakthroughs. Prime Minister Maliki accused Syria of sheltering armed organizations and Baath Party members wanted by Iraqi courts. Syrian President Asad denied the accusations, stating Syria hosts 1.2 million Iraqis. Relations deteriorated further, with Iraq demanding Syria to extradite individuals. Relations between Syria and Iraq have worsened following accusations of sheltering wanted individuals. Iraq demands extradition of suspects involved in bombings, leading to a strained diplomatic relationship. Iraq's refugee crisis also impacts Syrian-Iraqi relations. The Iraqi refugee crisis has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations, with Syria hosting 1.3 million refugees. This has led to economic strains in Syria, including inflation, rising rents, and water shortages. Syrian authorities have imposed a visa requirement for new arrivals and are seeking more assistance from the Iraqi government and international community. The Maliki government has provided little assistance to Syrian refugees, with only $15 million pledged in April 2007. International aid organizations have been discouraged by Syria's bureaucratic hurdles. Despite strained relations, Syria and Iraq have engaged in discussions on various issues, including energy cooperation and border security. In August 2007, Maliki visited Syria to discuss security, commercial agreements, and the reopening of an oil pipeline. In 2009, Syria and Iraq discussed reopening an oil pipeline for Iraqi oil exports. Despite initial agreements, repair work on the pipeline has not started due to a failed contract with a Russian firm. Both countries have announced plans to repair the pipeline, but there have been no updates on the progress. In 2009, Syria and Iraq reached an agreement to repair a pipeline for Iraqi oil exports. Syria has developed ties with various Iraqi parties, including Shiite groups like the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Sadrists. Syrian President Bashar al-Asad has maintained relationships with Iraqi leaders, including Kurdish leader and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. Syrian-Iraqi trade reached $6.6 billion in 2008. Despite diplomatic tensions over alleged Syrian involvement in bomb attacks in Baghdad, Syria continues to engage with Iraqi groups to retain influence in Iraqi affairs. Syrian-Iraqi relations may be strained due to alleged Syrian support for Sunni insurgents and terrorists in Iraq. The situation could remain static unless Syria prioritizes improving relations with Iraq over supporting these groups. Without sustained cooperation, both countries may miss out on economic benefits like energy deals and access to new markets. Jordan's strong relations with Iraq during Saddam Hussein's era contrast with the current situation. Jordan's relationship with Iraq during Saddam Hussein's era was strong, but since 2003, Jordan has been more concerned with Iraq's influence on its own politics, trade, and security. Jordan has limited ability to intervene in Iraq's affairs and has been a source of foreign fighters for the Sunni insurgency. Zarqa, an industrial town, has been a documented source of Sunni militancy, with many young men traveling to Iraq as suicide bombers. The Islamist community leader in Zarqa notes that many young people in the town are influenced by news from Islamic countries and feel compelled to join jihad. Jordan faces threats from transnational terrorism, with concerns about Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists using Iraq as a base to destabilize the country. Recent attacks in Amman and a foiled bomb plot at Queen Alia Airport highlight the ongoing security challenges faced by Jordan. Jordan thwarted a potential bomb attack at Queen Alia Airport targeting foreign tourists. The convicted conspirators included Iraqis, with one ringleader planning to use PE-4A explosive. The influx of 400,000-500,000 Iraqis in Jordan has strained the economy and society, leading to inflation and concerns about sectarian tensions. Jordan has sealed its borders to prevent further inflow of Iraqi refugees. The Jordanian government treats the influx of Iraqi refugees as a national security issue, imposing restrictions on young Iraqi males entering the country. Displaced Iraqis in Jordan are classified as \"visitors\" or \"guests\" due to the lack of a domestic refugee law. Those who deposit $150,000 in Amman banks are granted residency instantly, while many Iraqis become illegal aliens after their visitor visas expire. In 2008, Jordan normalized relations with Iraq, with King Abdullah II being the first Arab leader to visit Iraq since 2003. Jordan normalized relations with Iraq in 2008, with King Abdullah II becoming the first Arab leader to visit Iraq since 2003. Iraq provided most of Jordan's oil needs during Saddam Hussein's regime, but after the U.S. invasion in 2003, Jordan had to seek oil from other sources due to strained relations with the new Iraqi government. A tentative oil deal was reached in 2006, and Iraqi crude oil shipments began arriving in Jordan in September 2008, with Jordan receiving approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a price between $10-$18 per barrel. Jordan and Iraq had an agreement for Jordan to receive 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discounted price. The agreement was revised in 2008 to $22 per barrel. Plans for a pipeline were scrapped due to cost projections, and Jordan is now seeking financing for a railroad system to transport Iraqi crude oil to its refinery in Zarqa. In 2009, Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement to establish a free trade zone to boost bilateral trade. Iraq and Jordan signed an agreement to establish a free trade zone to increase bilateral trade. Iraqi-Jordanian trade reached $1 billion in 2008. Discussions also addressed Iraqi debts to Jordan, with the Iraqi central bank owing over $1 billion. Jordan faces threats from militant Islamist groups in Iraq as U.S. forces withdraw. Jordan's intelligence services are strong, but the risk of a large-scale terrorist attack remains. Jordan faces the risk of a large-scale terrorist attack, rather than an Islamist-led revolution. Government relations between Jordan and Iraq are expected to improve, but ties to the Saddam Hussein regime may hinder progress. Both countries need to address issues such as Iraqi refugees, energy deals, border security, and their relationship with Iran. Sunni Arab states, including Jordan, are wary of Iranian intentions in the region. Gulf leaders were hesitant to support U.S. military operations in Iraq without UN authorization. The fall of Saddam Hussein regime initially relieved Gulf leaders of a conventional threat, but instability in Iraq and concerns about Iran's influence created new fears. Gulf states were cautious about supporting U.S. military operations in Iraq without UN authorization. Despite relative calm, the rise of Shiite factions in post-Saddam Iraq still poses a threat perception among some Gulf leaders. Some Gulf states have taken steps to improve bilateral relations with Iraq, such as appointing ambassadors and writing off Iraqi debt. There are concerns about Iraq becoming a safe haven for terrorists if security gains are reversed, leading to renewed security discussions between Gulf states and the United States. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki visited Washington, DC in July 2009 to address remaining issues with the United Nations. In July 2009, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki visited Washington, DC to discuss closing issues with the United Nations Security Council from the Saddam era. The U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement aims to return Iraq to its pre-invasion international standing. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1859 decided to review resolutions stemming from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, with Kuwait seeking unresolved issues to remain open while Iraq pushes for closure. Iraq is pushing for an early resolution of issues related to reparations to Kuwait from the 1990 invasion, costing Iraq $660 million in 2009. Kuwait argues for full compensation, but many believe it is wealthy enough to end the reparations process for regional harmony. The United States, a close ally of Kuwait, has not openly supported Iraq's position. Kuwait's Amir visited the U.S. in August 2009, following Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's visit to discuss closing Saddam-era issues with the UN Security Council. Shaykh Sabah al Ahmad al Jabir Al Sabah visited the United States in August 2009 and met with President Obama. The meeting likely discussed the Chapter VII issue, despite official statements not mentioning it. Kuwait's government structure allows the emir to shift blame to the parliament for delays in agreements with Iraq. The complex interests of Iraq's neighbors and the U.S. pose challenges for policymakers. Congress is considering policy changes to support Iraq's stabilization. The U.S. and Congress provide funding and support for Iraq's stabilization, economic reform, and reintegration in the region.

The Bush Administration initiated discussions with Iran, and the Obama Administration continued and expanded dialogue with Syria. The key questions revolve around the level of support Iraq's neighbors are willing to provide for Iraqi reconciliation efforts.
