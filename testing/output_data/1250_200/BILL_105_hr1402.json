    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving process efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions of dollars for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they hold promise for better understanding safety and environmental risks. Implementing probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts could lead to cost reductions and better product specifications. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability in transportation systems, which could also benefit other Federal agencies. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve reliability in transportation systems. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how probabilistic methods can enhance the Department of Transportation, assess their impact on maximizing ROI and public safety, evaluate technology state, establish models for quantifying uncertainties, recommend guidelines for implementation, set reliability levels for public safety, and create guidelines for safety tests and databases. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for safety tests and creating databases, determine means of expediting technology transfer, identify barriers to using probabilistic methods, make recommendations for their use in DOT programs, institutionalize their values, and suggest pilot projects for evaluation. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson with engineering society experience, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, and public interest. Additionally, there will be representatives from the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. Each member will serve for the life of the Commission. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed for life, with vacancies filled in the same manner. Members serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members, and the initial meeting must occur within 180 days. Within 6 months of the initial meeting, an agenda must be transmitted to the Administrator. The Department of Transportation will provide administrative support to the Commission as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants and obtain official data from government agencies. They can also use the United States mails for communication. The Commission is required to submit reports. The Commission is required to submit an interim report to the Administrator within 2 years of its initial meeting and a final report within 36 months. The Commission will terminate 10 days after submitting the final report. Any spending authority authorized by this Act is subject to appropriation Acts."
