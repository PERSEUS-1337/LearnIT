    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed a bill with $100 million more funding for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version includes no funding for the project. The bill passed in June 2018 does not include funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Despite the Obama Administration's decision to halt funding for the project in 2010, Yucca Mountain remains the sole candidate site for a national high-level radioactive waste repository. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended the establishment of a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities. A new organization with authority and resources is recommended to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process. Long-term research on waste disposal technologies is also advised. The DOE issued a strategy for managing nuclear waste, calling for the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites. Plans include opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, determining that the repository design would meet safety standards. Volume 3 of the report concluded that the design would comply with standards after being permanently sealed. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, determining that the Yucca Mountain repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards after being permanently sealed. NRC completed a supplemental EIS in May 2016 and made its database of licensing documents publicly available. Additional appropriations of $330 million were requested to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on issues raised by the State of Nevada. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities. This would reverse a 1985 decision to dispose of defense and civilian nuclear waste together. The Defense Department suggested that a defense-only repository could be easier to site, license, and construct due to the smaller volume and radioactivity of defense waste. The DOE concluded in 2014 that a defense-only repository could proceed without amending the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. A defense-only repository could proceed without amending the NWPA, subject to NRC licensing and other requirements. GAO criticized DOE's analysis for excluding major costs and having an optimistic schedule. Legislation aims to block development of a defense-only repository before a decision on Yucca Mountain. The House passed legislation (H.R. 433) to block a defense-only repository until a licensing decision on the Yucca Mountain repository is made. A similar provision is included in H.R. 3053. The Senate passed a bill (H.R. 5895) authorizing DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, with priority given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites. DOE would need consent from the host state, localities, and Indian tribes for site selection, and report to Congress on compensation and waste movement to a permanent repository. The Senate Appropriations Committee has included provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage in previous Energy and Water Development funding bills. The House has not included similar provisions in its bills. A nuclear waste bill passed by the House authorizes the Department of Energy to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. Legislation to implement major recommendations on nuclear waste management has been introduced but not enacted in the past. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) was introduced by Senator Lamar Alexander to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for nuclear waste storage and disposal. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico, with plans for a facility to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos over 20 years. Waste Control Specialists also filed an application for an NRC. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Nuclear Waste Fund, with an estimated $1.5 billion in FY2017, could be used by DOE for private interim storage without further congressional approval. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget included funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application, and $10 million for interim storage facilities. The total $120 million funding would come from two appropriations accounts. The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bills (H.R. 5895) included $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill passed without Yucca Mountain funding, continuing a pattern of funding uncertainty. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, totaling about $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague to estimate costs for the nuclear waste program. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in 2010. NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste after the rule was struck down. NRC approved a continued storage rule in 2014, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions. A lawsuit to overturn the continued storage rule was rejected in 2016. NRC proposed a modification of low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled on June 3, 2016, regarding NRC's low-level waste disposal regulations. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste, including highly radioactive spent fuel and low-level waste, remains a significant issue in the nuclear power industry. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from Nevada due to safety concerns. DOE submitted a license application for the repository in 2008, projecting waste acceptance by 2020. However, the Obama Administration decided against opening the Yucca Mountain repository due to continued opposition. The Obama Administration made a policy decision to halt funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, leading to the shutdown of the project. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget submission. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, leading to the project shutdown. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $110 million for DOE and $47.7 million for NRC in FY2019. DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, which was denied by the ASLB. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion in 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines repository acceptability. NRC sustained the decision in 2011 but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits led to a court ruling in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed staff to complete the safety evaluation report in 2013, issuing Volume 3 in 2014, concluding that the repository design would comply with safety standards. The NRC issued Volume 3 of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in 2014, stating that DOE's Yucca Mountain repository design would comply with safety standards for 1 million years. The final two volumes of the SER were issued in 2015. NRC required all land and water rights to be met before authorizing construction of the repository. Additional funding of $330 million was needed for the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future in 2010 to explore alternative waste disposal strategies. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended creating a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities using a consent-based process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy in 2013 calling for the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites, with plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2025. The DOE planned to open a spent fuel storage facility by 2021, followed by a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was scheduled to open by 2048. Public meetings were held to develop a consent-based siting process, addressing issues like fairness, site-selection models, and information requirements. A draft consent-based siting process was issued in January 2017, outlining five phases for the process. The DOE planned to open a spent fuel storage facility by 2021, followed by a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was scheduled to open by 2048. Public meetings were held to develop a consent-based siting process, addressing issues like fairness, site-selection models, and information requirements. A draft consent-based siting process was issued in January 2017, outlining five phases for the process. The process includes grants for communities to request site assessments, detailed assessments, negotiation of siting agreements, and licensing, construction, operation, and closure of storage or disposal facilities. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019 would provide funding for a Yucca Mountain facility. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019 includes funding for a program office, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of documents. The request for $10 million for interim storage involves planning for storage services and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage facilities. The safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel depends on rock formations characteristics. The geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste depends on the characteristics of rock formations. Despite worldwide consensus on geologic isolation as the safest option, specific sites like Yucca Mountain face challenges due to uncertainties in predicting site performance over 1 million years. Public controversy also surrounds waste transportation routes to these sites. President Obama's budgets for FY2017 and previous years included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recycle elements like plutonium, but this was controversial due to cost and weapons concerns. The Obama Administration shifted focus to fundamental science research, while the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget reduced funding for reprocessing. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal in 2002. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal in 2002, despite opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn. The approval resolution was signed into law in July 2002. Low-level civilian radioactive waste disposal is currently done in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, with restrictions on waste acceptance at some facilities. The Carolina site is only available to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. A Utah facility accepts class A low-level radioactive waste from across the US. Threats to close disposal facilities led to the authorization of regional compacts in 1985. The first new disposal site under the compact system opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature approved legislation to allow non-compact states to use up to 30% of the facility's capacity. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts for nuclear waste disposal. All reactor operators signed contracts with DOE as required by the act. After DOE missed the contractual deadline for nuclear waste disposal, utilities filed lawsuits to recover storage costs. A settlement with PECO Energy allowed them to keep $80 million in waste fee revenues. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation for missed deadlines must come from sources other than the waste fund. Subsequent compensation to utilities has been paid from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund. Subsequent nuclear waste compensation to utilities has come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, a permanent account used to cover damage claims against the U.S. government. Payments from the Judgment Fund do not require appropriations. By the end of FY2017, 39 lawsuits had been settled, representing utilities that generate 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. Utilities not settled with the Department of Justice seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Awards by the Court of Claims can cover only damages that have already been incurred. Federal Claims cover damages already incurred from DOE's nuclear waste delays, with potential liabilities totaling $34.1 billion. Delays could lead to environmental enforcement action over DOE-owned waste stored in noncompliance. DOE must charge a fee on nuclear power generation for waste disposal, but after halting the Yucca Mountain project, lawsuits were filed to stop further collection. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop collecting nuclear waste fees after DOE halted the Yucca Mountain project. DOE suspended fee collections in May 2014, leading to petitions filed by NARUC and NEI to end the fees. DOE argued that fees totaling $750 million per year were necessary for future disposal costs, despite opposition claiming excess funds were being collected. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in November 2010 that there was no reasonable basis to conclude that excess funds were being collected. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in June 2012 that Secretary Chu's determination on nuclear waste fees was invalid and ordered a more thorough study within six months. DOE conducted a new fee assessment in January 2013, finding varying scenarios with costs exceeding revenues by up to $2 trillion or resulting in a surplus of $5 trillion. Due to the uncertainty, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to support the existing fee. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a review of DOE's nuclear waste fees in 2012. DOE found cost scenarios with a $2 trillion deficit or a $5 trillion surplus in 2013. Due to the uncertainty, DOE stopped collecting fees in 2014. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program in 2019. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not feasible for nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration's policy change was due to opposition from Nevada and a desire for a more accepted waste solution. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion, citing NWPA regulations. The NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the Yucca Mountain license application until NRC determines its acceptability. DOE argued for the authority to discontinue the project, but NRC commissioners upheld the denial of the withdrawal in 2011. NRC stopped further consideration due to budget constraints. The NRC halted consideration of the Yucca Mountain license application in 2011 due to budget constraints. The Court of Appeals ordered NRC to continue work on the license application in 2013, with $11.1 million in funds available. Additional funding of $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, along with DOE's estimated costs of $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license in FY2018. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for the Yucca Mountain project. DOE's FY2018 budget includes funding for a program office, legal and technical support, and managing supporting documents. NRC also requests additional funds to restart the adjudicatory proceeding. NRC must ensure safe disposal of nuclear waste before issuing licenses, with a previous decision stating waste could be stored safely for 30 years. DOE's schedule for a waste repository has been delayed, leading to updates in the Waste Confidence Decision. The NRC updated the Waste Confidence Decision in 1990, anticipating a repository by the 21st century. The 2010 rule allowed waste storage at reactor sites for 60 years post-shutdown. Lawsuits challenged this rule, leading to a court ruling in 2012 for NRC to conduct an environmental review under NEPA due to flaws in the rulemaking process. The NRC failed to calculate the environmental effects of not securing permanent storage for nuclear waste. They also did not properly assess future dangers and consequences of storing spent fuel on site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. NRC approved a new rule in 2014 for continued storage of nuclear waste, based on a generic environmental impact statement. The Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage for nuclear waste before a permanent repository would become available. A consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy. President Trump proposed restarting the project. The House consistently voted to continue or restore Yucca Mountain funding, while the Senate repeatedly zeroed it out, with President Obama's support. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has changed the dynamics of the congressional debate on nuclear waste. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 and FY2019, while the Senate did not. Senator Reid's retirement and concerns about nuclear waste were raised during former Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmation hearing for Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada issued a statement after voting to confirm Perry. After voting to confirm Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto expressed concerns about Yucca Mountain becoming a nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 aimed to withdraw the site from public lands laws and increase its capacity for storing spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 aims to increase the capacity of the Yucca Mountain repository for storing spent nuclear fuel. The bill includes provisions for interim storage facilities and mandatory funding for repository development. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 aims to transfer ownership of spent nuclear fuel to the Secretary of Energy for storage at a permanent repository. The Department of Energy is authorized to construct and operate one or more Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities, or partner with nonfederal entities for storage. Nonfederal MRS facilities require approval from the NRC, state governor, local government, and affected Indian tribe. Priority is given to nonfederal facilities unless a federal MRS can be built quicker and cheaper. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 authorizes the construction of Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities unless a federal MRS can be built more quickly and cost-effectively. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund instead of the Nuclear Waste Fund. Waste cannot be stored at the initial MRS facility until the NRC approves the Yucca Mountain repository construction or if the Secretary of Energy deems an NRC decision imminent. MRS construction would halt if the repository license is revoked. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository on federal land would be permanently withdrawn for nuclear waste storage, exempt from certain waste disposal regulations. The NRC must decide on construction within 30 months, allowing for infrastructure activities before authorization. The DOE could conduct infrastructure activities at the Yucca Mountain site, raising the limit on nuclear waste disposal to 110,000 metric tons. Planning for a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC's decision on Yucca Mountain. Collection of nuclear waste fees is tied to NRC's decision on construction authorization. Fees collected would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program. The bill allows for nuclear waste fees to offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, ensuring that annual appropriations up to the amount of fees would net to zero. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy could enter into a benefits agreement with Nevada, providing increased annual payments and a larger initial payment upon the first spent fuel receipt at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would receive increased payments under the bill for hosting the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with a larger initial payment of $400 million and annual payments of $40 million. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would oversee the functions of the Secretary of Energy related to nuclear waste management. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced companion versions of the Nuclear Waste Act. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, requires the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act, introduced by Representative Joe Wilson, prohibits the development of a repository for defense waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel are being proposed in Texas and New Mexico. Private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel in Texas and New Mexico have attracted congressional interest. Legislation such as H.R. 474 and H.R. 3053 authorize the Department of Energy (DOE) to enter into contracts with privately owned storage facilities. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility, with funding from the Nuclear Waste Fund. Additionally, H.R. 4442 authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Legislation introduced in 2017 (H.R. 4442) authorized the Department of Energy (DOE) to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Priority would be given to sites with no operating reactors and a large population nearby. Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider also introduced bills (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) to provide assistance to communities with stored nuclear waste, including financial support, tax credits, and access to government assistance programs. The bills also require DOE to explore other options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study potential economic uses for closed reactor sites. In the 115th Congress, the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) was introduced to require nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for removing spent fuel from storage pools. Spent fuel would need to be transferred to dry storage facilities within seven years if it has been in a storage pool for at least seven years. Emergency planning zones would be expanded, and NRC could use interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund to provide grants for this purpose. H.R. 4891 aims to use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to grant nuclear power plants for transferring spent fuel to dry storage. This bill is similar to previous legislation introduced in the 114th Congress by Representative Engel and Senator Markey. Senator Alexander also introduced legislation in the 114th Congress to redirect the nuclear waste program, establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for storage and disposal facilities with consent from state, local, and tribal governments. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) was planned to open a storage facility for waste from operating reactors by the end of 2025 and a permanent repository by 2048. NWA could offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste facilities, with preference given to sites that include both storage and a repository. Highly radioactive defense waste could be placed in defense-only storage and disposal facilities. President Obama authorized the pursuit of a defense-only repository in 2015. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository in 2015 under S. 854. The bill established a Working Capital Fund for nuclear waste fees collected post-enactment. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would be repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill, while NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd called it a step in the right direction but urged continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. This bill would require certain actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste could be sited. Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill due to concerns about temporary waste storage facilities opening without progress on a permanent repository and inadequate state authority to regulate repository safety. The FY2016 Energy and Water bill included language related to nuclear waste policy, influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill requiring NRC to maintain safety and security requirements. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer (S. 944) in 2015 aimed to ensure safety at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC's study found limited safety benefits in expedited fuel transfer. Radioactive waste varies in intensity and decay rates, with spent nuclear fuel being a major type. Spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive waste from a nuclear reactor after irradiation, containing fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. High-level waste is the residue from spent fuel reprocessing, while transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements. Transuranic waste, generated mainly by nuclear weapons production, requires long-term isolation due to plutonium content. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste. Low-level waste, not classified as spent fuel or high-level waste, is categorized by NRC into four classes based on radioactivity levels. Low-level waste disposal facilities are regulated by the NRC and cannot accept material that exceeds concentration limits. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, creating institutional regulatory challenges. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is highly radioactive and stored in deep pools of water to prevent overheating. The fuel assemblies consist of metal-clad fuel rods containing uranium enriched in U-235. After nuclear fission, most U-235 nuclei have split into radioactive fission products. Older spent fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to radiation-shielded storage to prevent pool overflow. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before transferring it to dry storage. Currently, there are 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory storing spent fuel. An estimated 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel was stored at U.S. nuclear plants in 2017, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. The DOE has estimated that between 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from existing U.S. reactors may need disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel were heightened after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The vulnerability of stored spent fuel has raised concerns about potential risks from aircraft crashes, sabotage, and terrorist attacks. Reports have highlighted the possibility of overheating and fires in spent fuel pools, recommending measures such as interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is sufficient time to implement cooling measures before a fire could occur. The safety benefits of expedited transfers to dry casks have been found to be minor. The NRC's report in 2013 found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel from pools to dry casks. The safety of spent fuel pools is being examined by an NRC task force post-Fukushima accident, recommending assured electrical power and water spray systems. NRC ordered reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment at spent fuel pools in 2012. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites in 2017. Volumes and radioactivity can vary yearly based on decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. The total volume of low-level radioactive waste reported in 2016 was 1.7 million cubic feet, with most of the radioactivity found in Class B and C waste. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, while states can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010, but the Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. In FY2019, a request for $110 million for Yucca Mountain and $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage at DOE, along with an additional $47.7 million for NRC was made. The Obama Administration had proposed a waste management strategy in 2013, calling for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management was created to implement the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 modified the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. The amendments also allowed for the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility, but prohibited its selection until a permanent repository is recommended and constructed at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred its functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, stating that the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site has broken down. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving negotiations with states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements. They suggested creating a congressionally chartered federal corporation for managing the waste program independently, with assured access to funds but subject to congressional oversight and regulation. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a federal corporation independent from Administration control for managing nuclear waste, with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground repository and interim storage facilities. The DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste in 2013. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale interim storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, with a site to be selected by 2016. The strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository and recommends flexibility in linking it to the development of a permanent repository. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing nuclear waste, including plans for interim storage facilities by 2021 and 2025. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, with site selection by 2016. The Obama Administration proposed a consent-based process for selecting sites, but details were lacking. A bill in the 114th Congress aimed to modify the waste program in line with the Administration's strategy. Congress by Senator Alexander (S. 854) proposed modifying the waste program to align with the Obama Administration's strategy. Privatization of waste management services has also been suggested. A 2014 DOE report recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a repository solely for defense and research waste, separate from civilian waste. This would reverse the long-standing policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The report suggested that a separate repository for defense and research waste could be developed more quickly than a repository for all highly radioactive waste. President Obama authorized DOE to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository, leading to bills introduced to delay the plan. Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, but other potential routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists applied for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas, later forming a joint venture with Orano USA. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) initially withdrew their application for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas due to high licensing costs. However, WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and resubmitted the application in 2018. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with a capacity of 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in dry casks on concrete pads. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be bound by restrictions that prohibit DOE from building a storage facility without making appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials support the development of waste facilities at the site, originally planned for high-level waste. New Mexico Governor expressed support for the project, while state senators raised concerns. Governor Susana Martinez supported ELEA's efforts in a letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, while Senators Udall and Heinrich opposed an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. The 2014 radioactive release from WIPP could impact public support for expanded waste activities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been shown in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation (H.R. 474) was introduced to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The bill (H.R. 3053) would transfer spent nuclear fuel to a private storage facility, with DOE taking title. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE for interim storage. A previous attempt to develop a private storage facility with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah was undertaken. The Department of the Interior rejected the PFS project due to risks of waste remaining indefinitely on tribal trust lands. A federal lawsuit was filed to overturn the decisions, leading to a court order for reconsideration. Despite efforts to redirect the nuclear waste program, current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for waste disposal. PFS eventually requested termination of its license in 2012. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) requires high-level waste repositories to be licensed by the NRC and meet EPA standards. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated new repository standards for Yucca Mountain. DOE shipments must use NRC-certified casks, comply with NRC requirements, and follow DOT regulations. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include compliance with EPA standards and procedures for seeking a repository license. The NRC requires a construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain repository before issuing a license for nuclear waste disposal. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were established to ensure compliance with EPA regulations. The NAS study recommended setting limits on risk to individuals near the repository, rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain repository, limiting annual radiation doses for the first 10,000 years of operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as too stringent, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short considering projected radioactive releases. EPA issued final standards on June 6, 2001. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite DOE's opposition, the site was deemed able to meet the standards. NRC revised its regulations to align with EPA standards in September 2001. A court panel on July 9, 2004, ruled the 10,000-year compliance period in the standards as inconsistent with the NAS study, which projected peak radioactive exposures hundreds of thousands of years in the future. EPA proposed a new version of the Yucca Mountain standards in response to the court decision. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards in 2001, with a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. In response to a court decision in 2005, EPA proposed new standards, retaining dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing a higher annual dose from 10,000 to 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. The final rule in 2008 reduced the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years, aligning with international standards. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to conform to new EPA standards in 2009. DOE estimated that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, significantly lower than previous estimates. Research is being conducted on technologies to improve spent nuclear fuel management. The Trump Administration's budget proposals for Fuel Cycle R&D included funding for nuclear waste processing technologies but eliminated support for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for generic nuclear waste R&D and integrated waste management activities. The FY2019 budget request includes funding for waste disposal R&D but no support for integrated waste management. The focus of the program is on reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. Nuclear utilities previously paid fees for disposal costs until halted by a court order in 2014. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in 2010. The total cost of the Yucca Mountain program was estimated at $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste, with most joining interstate compacts for disposal. Most states have joined interstate compacts for low-level radioactive waste disposal, with facilities in Barnwell, SC, Hanford, WA, and Utah handling waste. A new disposal facility in Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C waste, with capacity for waste from other states as well. The Texas disposal site in Andrews County has 30% of its capacity allocated for waste from other states. The first shipment of waste arrived from Vermont in 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998, but a proposed site near Sierra Blanca was rejected. Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities in 2003, with the Andrews County facility approved in 2011. The Barnwell, SC facility is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. The Barnwell, SC disposal facility was approved for construction on January 7, 2011. It currently accepts low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes South Carolina, Connecticut, and New Jersey. South Carolina can limit the facility's use to compact members only, with a law enacted in June 2000 phasing out acceptance of noncompact waste. The facility had previously stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact in June 1994. South Carolina's proposal to open the facility to waste generators outside the Southeast was rejected in 1995, leading to the state's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact. North Carolina also withdrew from the compact in 1999. The Barnwell disposal facility in South Carolina accepts waste from states excluding North Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not lead to sanctions. Hanford, WA is another disposal site for low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. NRC regulates licensing of low-level waste facilities, with transportation jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to disposal regulations in 2015, with final approval in 2017. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval in 2016, with further revisions issued in 2017. The regulations establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites, requiring a 1,000-year compliance period for sites without significant radioactive material and a 10,000-year period for sites with significant quantities. Post-10,000-year analysis and protection for inadvertent intruders are also mandated. The current low-level waste regulations date back to 1982, and the disposal of radioactive waste remains a key issue in the nuclear power debate. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama terminated the project. Congress is debating its future, with the NRC finding in 2014 that the site meets standards. The Trump Administration proposed restarting Yucca Mountain licensing, which may be influenced by the retirement of Senator Reid, a strong opponent of the project. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid, who strongly opposed the project, could impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. Despite the funding not being approved for FY2018, the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE may seek damages from the government if disposal delays persist, potentially leading to significant liabilities. Liabilities for waste program delays could reach $34.1 billion, with $6.9 billion already paid to utilities. The nuclear industry warns of potential future damages in the tens of billions if the disposal program fails. Lack of a disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission suggested options like centralized interim storage and a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process, which has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Previous voluntary siting efforts were blocked by potential host states, highlighting the need for state cooperation in any renewed siting effort. The curr_chunk provides links to reports and papers on current nuclear waste issues, including the economics of reprocessing vs. direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel, commercial spent nuclear fuel, and technical issues associated with high-level radioactive waste. It also mentions the experience gained from programs to manage high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in the United States and other countries. The curr_chunk provides links to reports and papers on managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, including strategy alternatives, policy implications, and a draft consent-based siting process for storage and disposal facilities. The curr_chunk includes links to reports and papers on managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, as well as safety evaluations related to disposal options. The curr_chunk mentions the death of Stu and the publication of a book by Walker on the development of radioactive waste policy in the United States."
