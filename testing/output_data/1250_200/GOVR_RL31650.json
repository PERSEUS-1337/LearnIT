    "content": "In February 2002, congressional intelligence committees launched a Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve the Intelligence Community's ability to prevent future attacks. Public hearings began in September 2002, with the final report expected in early 2003. Congress passed the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act on November 27, 2002, establishing an independent entity. The FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act passed by Congress on November 27, 2002 established an independent commission to investigate the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. The commission, led by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean, will consider the findings of the Joint Inquiry and make recommendations for preventing future terrorist attacks. The investigation was prompted by the need to assess the performance of relevant agencies following the precedent of the congressional inquiry into the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. The FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act established an independent commission to investigate the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks, following the precedent of the congressional inquiry into the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. The House initially voted for an independent commission, but it was dropped in favor of Congress conducting its own investigation focused on intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Joint Inquiry staff, led by Eleanor Hill, consisted of twenty-four professionals with backgrounds in intelligence, law enforcement, and oversight. They were divided into five investigative teams to look into different aspects of the 9/11 attacks, including the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Interviews and document collection were conducted at various federal agencies and private sector entities. Public hearings, initially scheduled for May, were delayed until mid-September. Ms. Hill and the Joint Inquiry staff have reviewed a significant amount of documents, conducted numerous interviews, and faced challenges with intelligence agencies providing information. There have been disagreements about procedures and concerns about public hearings before the investigation is complete. Despite some communication breakdowns, the public hearings in September-October 2002 have provided insights into the Joint Inquiry's direction. The September-October 2002 public hearings and statements by Ms. Hill provided insights into the Joint Inquiry staff's direction and conclusions. Testimonies included representatives of victims' families, law enforcement and intelligence officials, outside experts, and senior officials from NSC. Ms. Hill emphasized that while there were general indications of a possible terrorist attack in 2001, there was no specific information prior to September 11 about the attacks' details. Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community had detailed information on the planned attacks by Al Qaeda, dating back to the 1980s. Despite previous terrorist incidents, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1998 embassy bombings, effective intelligence and law enforcement efforts were lacking. Ms. Hill discussed the response of government agencies to terrorist attacks before 2001, highlighting the shift in threats from the Cold War era to a new breed of terrorists without state sponsors. By the mid-1990s, attention had turned to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, leading to increased focus on intelligence and law enforcement efforts, cooperation with foreign governments, and the development of new legal strategies to combat terrorism. Intelligence agencies issued warnings of growing threats of attacks. Ms. Hill highlighted the warnings issued by intelligence agencies in mid-2001 about a potential terrorist attack by Osama bin Laden. Despite consistent reporting on Al Qaeda activities, there was no comprehensive list of terrorist threats to the US, and little attention was given to the possibility of using hijacked aircraft for attacks. Despite threat warnings in mid-2001, there was a lack of comprehensive effort to educate the American public on the possibility of using hijacked aircraft for attacks. The FBI's handling of the Phoenix Memorandum, which called for further investigation of individuals with ties to terrorist organizations attending flight schools, did not receive sustained attention or action before September 11. This failure was attributed to administrative, legal, and policy barriers hindering long-term strategic analysis within the FBI. The Phoenix EC focused on short-term operational priorities, neglecting long-term strategic analysis. The Inquiry revealed that hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were not included in watchlists despite prior intelligence, leading to their entry into the U.S. due to a lack of formal systems and training for watchlisting suspected terrorists. The CIA failed to watchlist suspected terrorists like Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, allowing them entry into the U.S. despite prior intelligence. Zacarias Moussaoui, detained in August 2001 for conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, was not thoroughly investigated by the FBI before September 11. FBI officials in Minnesota sought a warrant to investigate Zacarias Moussaoui's notes and computer disks before September 11, but authorization was not approved. There were debates over the type of warrant to use, with the FBI considering deporting Moussaoui to France for a search. Additionally, there were concerns about the U.S.'s limited ability to monitor Al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan. Diplomatic pressure and missile strikes were used, but there was a lack of integration in national power instruments. Clinton ordered missile strikes on a presumed Al Qaeda site in August 1998, but there was little effort to integrate all national power instruments. Ms. Hill noted the lack of mobilization of public opinion and the failure to communicate the extent of the terrorist threat to the American public before September 11. She also expressed concerns about the FBI's focus on individual prosecutions rather than making necessary changes to fight terrorism effectively. The Bureau had few officials assigned to counterterrorism and gave the effort a low priority. Ms. Hill criticized the FBI for its lack of focus on counterterrorism efforts in the United States, pointing out the decentralized structure and inability to gather intelligence on terrorist plots. She highlighted the Bureau's narrow approach to the terrorist threat and its disinclination to target suspects residing outside the U.S. This limited attention to domestic dangers reflected a significant gap in the FBI's efforts. Ms. Hill criticized the FBI for its lack of focus on counterterrorism efforts in the United States, highlighting the agency's disinclination to target suspects residing outside the country. She pointed out the gap in the U.S. government's counterterrorism structure, emphasizing the lack of strategic analysis on how international terrorist groups might target the homeland. The FBI's emphasis on gathering evidence on crimes rather than assessing threats to the homeland was noted by the Joint Inquiry staff. Additionally, the reliance on law enforcement tools as the primary instrument of American counterterrorism strategy was highlighted, with a focus on prosecuting individuals for immigration law violations rather than targeting masterminds abroad. The FBI's focus on prosecuting individuals for immigration law violations rather than targeting masterminds abroad hindered counterterrorism efforts. Institutional \"walls\" were identified that hindered cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, stemming from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Osama Bin Laden's indictment in 1998 did not impede his activities. The \"walls\" between law enforcement and intelligence agencies created bureaucratic hurdles and hindered counterterrorism efforts. Concerns about contaminating criminal investigations with intelligence information led to ineffective resource allocation. The New York FBI office faced obstacles in using full investigative resources against Khalid al-Mihdhar due to these barriers. The FBI faced limitations in tracking Khalid al-Mihdhar's whereabouts due to constraints on using intelligence information in criminal investigations. This hindered efforts as al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi prepared for the September 11 attacks. Inadequate communication between intelligence and law enforcement agencies highlighted the need for better information sharing post-9/11. The United States Government acknowledges the need to consolidate and streamline information on threats. Concerns exist about removing barriers between different types of information and analytical functions, potentially impacting civil liberties. Public hearings discussed reactions to radical Islamic terrorism in the 1990s and efforts against Bin Laden's organization by the Clinton Administration. The public hearings in the 1990s addressed intelligence failures related to terrorist connections, efforts to improve counterterrorism capabilities, and the need for reorganizing intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Despite awareness of Al Qaeda's hostile intentions, some attacks were thwarted, and individuals were arrested and convicted. Collaboration with foreign governments had mixed success. The public hearings in the 1990s addressed intelligence failures related to terrorist connections and efforts to improve counterterrorism capabilities. Attacks were thwarted, individuals were arrested and convicted, and collaboration with foreign governments had mixed success. The hearings highlighted procedural problems in sharing information and missed opportunities to prevent the September 11 attacks. Family representatives called for an investigation into government agencies' failures. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger testified about the Clinton Administration's increased focus on counterterrorism, successes in thwarting past attacks, and the FBI's lack of emphasis on counterterrorism compared to the CIA. Family representatives expressed frustration over intelligence failures that led to the 9/11 attacks. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger highlighted the need for improved coordination and integration of intelligence, emphasizing the importance of human intelligence and predictive intelligence to provide tactical warning. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III provided a summary of information on the nineteen hijackers, their activities, and the simple tools they used in the 9/11 attacks. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III acknowledged the sophistication of the 9/11 terrorists in planning and executing the attacks using simple tools like box cutters. He also admitted to valid criticisms, such as the failure to disseminate important memos and review warrant requests properly. FBI Director Mueller acknowledged the 9/11 terrorists' sophistication in planning and executing the attacks. Former Director Louis Freeh described the Bureau's counterterrorist efforts during his tenure, including doubling the number of agents assigned to counterterrorism and establishing Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Freeh also discussed his involvement in the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh described his involvement in the investigation of the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, acknowledging the national security threat it posed. He also highlighted longstanding IT problems within the FBI, with necessary upgrades delayed until September 2000. The events of September 11 changed the operational rules for FBI officials. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh highlighted the impact of September 11 on FBI operations, including restrictions on agents visiting suspect groups' websites. In May 2002, new guidelines were issued to remove these restrictions. Admiral Lowell Jacoby of the Defense Intelligence Agency emphasized the need for analysts to have access to all available information, advocating for a new paradigm where analysts, not collectors, own information. Analysts have been increasingly separated from the raw material of their trade, hindering comprehensive analysis. In the context of intelligence and law enforcement operations post-9/11, there is a call for breaking down barriers to information exchange among agencies. Former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and NSA Director General Michael Hayden emphasize the need to address issues related to the separation of intelligence and law enforcement functions in international terrorism investigations. White suggests addressing the bifurcation of these communities, including the use of FISA and dissemination of FISA search results. Hayden points out the challenges in conducting electronic searches for law enforcement purposes compared to foreign intelligence purposes.

James Gilmore, Chairman of the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, stresses the importance of intelligence and information sharing in combating terrorism. The Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, testified about the Intelligence Community's tracking of Bin Laden as a terrorist leader and the comprehensive operation plan to disrupt Al Qaeda's finances and activities. The CIA recruited officers with relevant experience for counterterrorist assignments. By 9/11, efforts were in place to track and act against the terrorist organization. CIA recruited and trained officers with relevant experience for counterterrorist assignments. By 9/11, collection programs and human networks were in place to cover Afghanistan, providing a large body of information and assets to support military campaigns against Taliban and Al Qaeda. Successes included bringing terrorists to justice worldwide, preventing attacks during the Millennium, and efforts to identify and dismantle terrorist groups in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. Reports of potential terrorist activities in 2001 pointed to the Middle East. Tenet and other officials were aware of the danger of an Al Qaeda attack, with a focus on potential attacks abroad, especially in the Middle East. There was also concern about a catastrophic attack within the U.S. using chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. Despite past instances of hijackings and plots, analysts did not prioritize these reports among the vast amount of data. Tenet mentioned budget cuts in the early 1990s affecting CIA's capabilities. Tenet highlighted the impact of budget cuts in the early 1990s, leading to a reduction in CIA positions. Despite an increase in funding for counterterrorism, Tenet's requests for additional intelligence funding were mostly denied. Supplemental appropriations supported counterterrorist missions, but were not reliable for long-term programs. The intelligence committees released findings and recommendations in December 2002, pending a complete report after a security review. Senator Shelby also made public extensive information. The Senate Intelligence Committee released findings and recommendations in December 2002, highlighting systemic weaknesses in intelligence and law enforcement communities. These included a lack of emphasis on counterterrorism, funding cuts, poor coordination, and inadequate human intelligence. The findings emphasized the need for a government-wide strategy to address and reduce terrorist threats. The Senate Intelligence Committee's recommendations in December 2002 highlighted systemic weaknesses in intelligence and law enforcement, emphasizing the need for a government-wide strategy to combat terrorism. Recommendations included creating a Director of National Intelligence separate from the CIA, establishing priorities for intelligence collection and analysis, and improving information sharing within the Intelligence Community and Department of Homeland Security. The Senate Intelligence Committee's recommendations in December 2002 emphasized the need for improved intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities, including full access to counterterrorism-related intelligence information. Recommendations also addressed technological challenges facing NSA and called for sustained investment in counterterrorism capabilities. Senator Shelby criticized the DCI's lack of management authority over the Intelligence Community and called for a reexamination of the National Security Act. Senator Shelby criticized the lack of management authority of the DCI over the Intelligence Community and called for a reexamination of the National Security Act of 1947. He highlighted the need for the Intelligence Community to be more agile and responsive to evolving threats, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes and continuously adapting to future challenges. Senator Shelby emphasizes the importance of learning from past mistakes and continuously adapting to future challenges in the Intelligence Community. He calls for improved coordination and information sharing among agencies, criticizes the dominant role of collection agencies, and supports deeper access to data for analysts. He highlights the need to unlock and study information about terrorist groups that has been accumulated but remains unused. Senator Shelby criticizes the FBI for its collapse and dysfunction in counterterrorism functions, calling for radical reform. He also highlights the need for real human intelligence (HUMINT) presence in counterterrorism, emphasizing the importance of undercover agents among the target population. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003 established an independent commission to investigate the background of the September 2001 attacks, ensuring transparency and thorough examination of all relevant factors. An independent commission was established by the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003 to investigate the September 2001 attacks. The commission is tasked with gathering information from government agencies, conducting hearings, and making recommendations for corrective measures within 18 months. It may also study organizational arrangements for intelligence resources and the role of intelligence agencies in tracking terrorists operating in the U.S. The issue at hand involves the role of intelligence agencies in tracking potential terrorists in the U.S., including the impact of legislation like the USA Patriot Act. Some suggest an independent commission should review the relationship between intelligence and law enforcement within the Department of Homeland Security. Concerns have been raised about the need to revisit restrictions on CIA involvement in domestic law enforcement activities. Senator Graham, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, emphasized the need to re-examine domestic intelligence collection post-9/11 to balance civil liberties with national security concerns. The Joint Inquiry is exploring the scope and limitations of gathering intelligence on U.S. citizens and lawful visitors to enhance domestic collection capabilities. The Joint Inquiry has investigated the background of the September 11 attacks and highlighted issues with information sharing among government agencies. Changes have been made through legislation and administrative procedures to address these issues, but some critics argue that mixing intelligence and law enforcement roles can compromise civil liberties. An independent commission could help achieve a public consensus on balancing national security and civil liberties. The final report of the two intelligence committees, expected in 2003, may propose changes in agency responsibilities and influence oversight of counterterrorist efforts in the 108th Congress. The emphasis is on bridging the gap between intelligence and law enforcement, with a focus on the FBI's counterterrorism efforts. Investigations into the September 11 attacks are ongoing, with statutory changes enacted and the creation of a new Department. The investigations into the September 11 attacks are ongoing, with statutory changes enacted and the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. Further changes may be necessary, especially in intelligence and law enforcement, to combat international terrorism. Discussions continue on potential statutory protections for civil liberties."
