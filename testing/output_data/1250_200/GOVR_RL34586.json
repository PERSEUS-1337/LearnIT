    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. UNICEF reported a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, but still, 26,000 children die each day under the age of five. The majority of childhood deaths occur before age five, with 37% occurring in the neonatal period. The majority of child deaths occur in developing countries, with almost half in Africa. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases are responsible for nearly 90% of all child deaths. Undernutrition is a significant underlying cause of these deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals aim to reduce child and maternal mortality by two-thirds. Progress in other MDGs, such as addressing undernourishment, impacts the ability to reach these goals. Progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is affected by factors like undernourishment and lack of clean water, leading to higher maternal and child mortality rates. UNICEF reports that 62 countries show no progress in child survival goals, with a majority in Africa. Maternal health is closely linked to child survival, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Access to adequate healthcare could prevent most of these deaths. The United Nations reports that maternal mortality is linked to undernutrition and obstetric complications, with younger mothers facing higher risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Adolescents aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates for both mothers and babies. Girls in this age group are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to older women. The United Nations estimates that adolescents aged 15-19 give birth to 15 million infants annually. Girls in this age group are at a higher risk of maternal mortality, with those under 15 being five times more likely to die from childbirth. Maternal mortality rates vary by region, with hemorrhage being a significant cause of death in Africa and Asia. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 99% in industrialized nations. In many countries, health systems lack capacity to reduce maternal mortality. 80% of priority countries have low health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland meet minimum standards. Adequate health workers improve child and maternal survival rates. Southeast Asia faces the greatest shortage of healthcare workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a critical shortage of healthcare workers globally, with the greatest proportional shortage in sub-Saharan Africa. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed worldwide, with African countries needing to increase their healthcare workforce by 140% to meet minimum standards. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) leads efforts to improve child survival globally, committing over $6 billion in the past 20 years for this cause. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing six major health issues that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization highlights the impact of hunger and malnutrition on child mortality, with WHO-supported studies showing the increased risk of infectious diseases for underweight children. Children who are underweight face a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with malnourished children being more susceptible to illnesses like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding to address these issues. USAID funds research on biofortified crops to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods. Micronutrient supplementation and nutrition programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation. USAID emphasizes the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for infants to prevent malnutrition-related deaths. The study showed that exclusively breastfed infants have significantly lower rates of childhood diseases and mortality. USAID and UNICEF emphasize the importance of breastfeeding, micronutrient supplementation, and vaccination to prevent malnutrition and pneumonia in children. Since 2002, USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Malaria poses a significant risk to about 40% of the world's population, with over 500 million severe cases annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is a deadly disease affecting Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. USAID has been involved in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, including the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to increase support for international malaria programs. PMI aims to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in 15 targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates PMI activities with the CDC, reaching over 25 million people within two years. In two years, PMI activities reached over 25 million people, including indoor residual spraying, distributing LLITNs, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, with successful interventions reducing mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive PMTCT drugs like Nevirapine costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose. The cost of preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission with drugs like Nevirapine is between $0.29 and $0.40 per dose. Early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for children, but the cost of ART for children is significantly higher than for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. In low-income countries, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for adults costs $148, while for children it costs $2,000 per child. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric treatments. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART), costing about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Cotrimoxazole, a drug for treating pneumonia in HIV-positive children, reduces mortality by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986, with PEPFAR implementing agencies providing over $289.2 million for care initiatives. PEPFAR has provided over $289.2 million for care initiatives benefiting 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs support training, technology use, income-generating activities, and access to essential health care. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support, with partnerships dedicating $191.5 million to pediatric treatment. In FY2006 and FY2007, PEPFAR partnerships allocated $191.5 million for pediatric HIV treatment, benefiting 85,900 children. PEPFAR-implementing agencies supported PMTCT services for over 10 million pregnancies, providing ART to HIV-positive women in 827,000 pregnancies. This prevented an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. USAID has provided $1.5 billion for the treatment of nearly 5 billion episodes of child diarrhea with ORS since 2002. Their programs focus on training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and improving hygiene to control diarrheal disease. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs emphasize hygiene, particularly handwashing with soap, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. However, soap usage for handwashing is low in poorer communities. Public-private partnerships supported by USAID promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices, such as safe water storage, to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. WHO highlights measles immunization as a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths. The measles vaccine is a cost-effective public health intervention for preventing childhood deaths, with a high health return for the money spent. The vaccine costs less than $1 per dose and can be combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines. Immunization coverage rates vary by region, with about 80% of children vaccinated in 2006. Between 2000 and 2006, 478 million children aged nine months to 14 years received measles vaccinations in 46 priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. USAID supports immunization programs by training health workers and partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Additionally, USAID's maternal health programs aim to improve pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions, including nutritional supplementation. USAID's maternal health programs focus on ensuring healthy pregnancy outcomes in low-resource environments through interventions like nutritional supplementation, immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and training birth attendants to avert infant deaths and provide emergency obstetric care. Community-based interventions include teaching families to recognize birth complications, arranging transportation to hospitals, identifying blood donors, and creating savings plans for healthcare costs. USAID's maternal health programs aim to address key causes of maternal mortality, such as postpartum hemorrhage and infections. They train birth attendants to manage labor effectively, administer drugs to prevent bleeding, and promote hygienic practices to reduce the risk of infections. These interventions can significantly reduce maternal deaths in low-resource settings. Infections and hypertensive disorders are significant causes of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. USAID supports efforts to prevent infections by promoting hygienic delivery practices and training birth attendants to identify and treat signs of infection. Additionally, USAID trains healthcare providers to recognize and manage hypertensive disorders like pre-eclampsia and eclampsia to reduce maternal mortality rates. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to complications for both the mother and baby, including obstetric fistula. This condition is more common in young girls and women in low-resource settings. Preventative measures include delaying pregnancy until the pelvic region is fully developed and ensuring access to emergency obstetric care. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively. Obstetric fistula prevention programs are integrated with other maternal health initiatives, including increasing access to emergency obstetrical care and reducing stigma. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. In Latin America and the Caribbean, unsafe abortions account for 12% of maternal deaths, while in Africa, it is about 4%. USAID's international family planning programs aim to address these issues. USAID's international family planning programs aim to address complications from unsafe abortions, which contribute to maternal deaths globally. In Africa, about 4% of women die after attempting an unsafe abortion. USAID reports that its programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003, with a focus on HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria during this time period. From FY2004 through FY2008, U.S. appropriations for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs dominated discussions at USAID. While some Members praised the focus on HIV/AIDS, others questioned the lack of funding for child survival, maternal health, and family planning. Congress urged better integration of HIV/AIDS with other health programs like TB and nutrition. During this period, $19.7 billion was allocated to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, far surpassing support for other health initiatives at USAID. During the Administration of President George W. Bush, Congress allocated $4.6 billion to USAID's global health programs, focusing on specific diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. While funding for these diseases increased, appropriations for child survival and maternal health initiatives remained relatively unchanged. Many health experts are concerned that life-saving interventions for women and children are being overlooked in favor of disease-specific programs. Many are concerned that global health funds prioritize diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria over life-saving interventions for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa. Calls for increased funding for child survival and maternal health programs, including voluntary family planning, to improve maternal and child health outcomes. Family planning activities are highlighted for their benefits in reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and stabilizing population growth. Family planning programs aim to provide counseling, condoms, and reduce abortions to protect the environment. Some oppose funding due to concerns about coercive practices. Adolescent girls face higher risks during pregnancy and childbirth, with those under 20 at increased risk of complications. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete can prevent obstetric fistula. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases are among adolescents. Obstetric fistula cases are prevalent among adolescents and can be prevented by delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete. Repairing the condition costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected individuals. Strengthening health systems, including access to maternal and child health services, vaccinations, and safe drinking water, is crucial to reducing maternal and child mortality. UNICEF emphasizes the need for donor support to deliver essential interventions effectively. Advocates urge Congress to enhance coordination of health assistance through USAID. Supporters advocate for better coordination of health assistance through USAID to improve efficiency and overall health outcomes. They suggest creating compacts with countries to ensure predictable, long-term financing for national health plans. This approach is inspired by WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+), which aims to improve health and development outcomes in developing countries. Global health experts emphasize the need for recipient governments to take a more active role in improving health systems. Critics argue that political will plays a significant role in the low health spending of many developing countries. According to the IMF, lack of political will is cited as a major reason for unspent health funds. African countries with severe health worker shortages spend significantly less on health compared to the US. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the AU and OAU members committing to this in April 2001. African leaders pledged to increase health spending in April 2001, with the Abuja Declaration calling for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. By 2004, only Botswana had met this target, while others allocated varying percentages to health budgets. Critics argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices have limited African governments' ability to invest in public health and health worker education. Structural adjustment programs and conditional lending have hindered African governments' ability to invest in public health and health worker education, leading to shrunken health budgets and a decline in education quality for medical students. This has resulted in shortages of health supplies, medicine, and vaccines, as well as a brain drain of African health workers. The International Development Research Center notes that discussions on the impact of these practices on public health are often biased, with mixed results observed. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized significant funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with provisions for maternal and child services. The House version emphasized linkages to NGOs for multi-sectoral approaches, while the Senate version did not include language on family planning. The Senate passed H.R. 5501 by voice vote, 80-16, with a substitute amendment that inserted the language of S. 2731 after amendments were made on the Senate floor. H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, Global Poverty Act of 2007, require the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to advance U.S. efforts to promote the reduction of global poverty, including improving maternal and child health. H.R. 2266 and S. 1418, U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007, provide assistance to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The House and Senate introduced bills to improve global child survival and maternal health in developing countries. H.R. 1225 focuses on family health programs, H.R. 2114 supports the prevention of obstetric fistula, and H.R. 2604 provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for women's health initiatives. The House and Senate introduced bills to improve global child survival and maternal health in developing countries. The bills aim to save women's lives, reduce unsafe abortions, promote family planning, and assist women, children, and men in developing countries. The bills were referred to the respective committees for further consideration. The resolution H.Res. 1022 aims to reduce nuclear armaments to save money for child survival, hunger, and education. It also promotes maternal health and child survival globally."
