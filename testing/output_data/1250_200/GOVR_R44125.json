    "content": "The consumer data industry provides information to firms about consumer behavior during financial transactions. This data is used by lenders, banks, insurance companies, and merchants to make decisions about offering products and setting premiums. Payday lenders also use consumer data to assess the risk of repayment for small-dollar cash advances. Consumer data is crucial for firms in making decisions about financial transactions. It is used to assess the risk of repayment for small-dollar cash advances, screen prospective employees, and evaluate risks associated with entering into financial relationships. Negative information like overdrafts and loan defaults can limit consumer access to credit for several years. The report discusses how inaccurate consumer data can limit access to credit and the challenges consumers face in correcting errors. It also covers the factors used to calculate credit scores and policy issues related to consumer data reports. The report addresses policy issues related to consumer data reports, including the accuracy of information, the impact of billing and collection practices, consumer rights, and data protection. In the 116th Congress, the House Financial Services Committee has shown interest in credit reporting and the consumer data industry, with Chairwoman Maxine Waters releasing draft bills for credit reporting reform. The House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters has released two draft bills addressing policy issues in the consumer data industry. The bills aim to reform credit reporting and protect innocent consumers affected by a shutdown. The consumer data industry includes credit reporting agencies (CRAs) and credit scoring services, regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). CRAs prepare consumer reports based on financial transaction history data, including credit repayment, tenant payment, employment, insurance claims, arrests, bankruptcies, and account management. Consumer reports from credit reporting agencies (CRAs) contain historical data on credit repayment, tenant payment, employment, insurance claims, arrests, bankruptcies, and account management. They do not include information on income or assets, race, ethnicity, religious or political preference, or medical history. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are the largest nationwide providers of credit reports, while other CRAs offer specialized consumer reporting services such as phone, utilities, and telecommunication payment data. Some CRAs focus on rent payment data for tenant and employment screening, while others cater to underbanked, near prime, and subprime consumer segments. Some CRAs specialize in consumer reporting for underbanked, near prime, and subprime consumers, debt collection, and fraud verification. Firms that use consumer reports may also report information to CRAs as furnishers. Tradelines are accounts reported to CRAs by furnishers, serving as records of transaction activity. Furnishing tradelines is voluntary, with different reporting practices among furnishers. They may report unpaid obligations, surpassing minimum thresholds, principal balances minus penalties, or all monies owed. Furnishers have discretion over the types of obligations they report. Benefits to users of consumer data increase as more companies choose to participate as furnishers, but there are costs involved. Firms must be approved and comply with CRA policies to report data, which involves security risks. Compliance with industry data transfer requirements may require investing in technology compatible with CRAs' systems. Smaller firms may find compliance costs burdensome, leading some to opt out of becoming furnishers. Legal obligations under the FCRA require furnishers to report accurate information and investigate consumer disputes, potentially resulting in legal costs. Consumer reporting obligations may lead to legal costs and influence a firm's decision to become a furnisher. Different CRAs have varying policies on reporting consumer information, leading to differences in consumer reports. Consumer scores are numeric metrics used to predict financial behaviors like loan default or insurance claims. Consumer scores are computed using information from consumer reports, with firms specializing in producing these scores. Different scoring firms may use varying data sources and statistical models, leading to differences in calculated scores for the same individual. Each firm has its own proprietary algorithms for weighting consumer information. Consumer scores are determined by firms using consumer reports, with each firm having its own algorithms for weighting information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, enacted in 1970, regulates the industry by requiring consumer reporting agencies to adopt fair procedures for handling consumer information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) establishes consumers' rights regarding their credit reports and imposes responsibilities on those who collect, furnish, and use the information. It includes consumer protection provisions such as free disclosure of information after adverse actions, the right to one free credit report annually, and the ability to dispute inaccurate information. The FCRA also limits the time negative information can remain on reports. The FCRA mandates that CRAs investigate and correct errors within 30 days. Negative information can only stay on credit reports for a limited time, such as 7 years for collection tradelines and 10 years for personal bankruptcy. The CFPB, established by Dodd-Frank, supervises CRAs with $7 million or more in annual receipts, conducting examinations to enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB supervises CRAs to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws, focusing on data accuracy, dispute resolution, and furnisher reporting. Efforts have been made to improve credit reporting systems, including new consumer protections established by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in response to the 2017 Equifax data breach. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 introduced new consumer protections regarding credit reporting, such as the right to a free credit freeze to prevent fraud and identity theft. The accuracy of consumer information in credit reports is a key concern, with the FTC reporting a high rate of errors in credit reports. Legislative proposals from the 116th Congress aim to address issues related to credit reporting and consumer lending decisions. The FTC study found that correcting errors on credit reports led to a 13% increase in credit scores for participants. Over 40% of those who saw an increase had their scores rise by more than 20 points, potentially leading to better credit terms. Inaccuracies in credit reporting can stem from various reasons, including consumer errors and furnisher mistakes. Ensuring accurate and up-to-date consumer data can enhance the predictive power of credit reports. The CFPB has encouraged credit bureaus and financial firms to improve data accuracy in credit reporting. Since 2014, accuracy reports are required from the largest consumer reporting firms, detailing consumer disputes, top furnishers, and dispute resolution information. The top 100 furnishers provide 76% of tradeline information to CRAs and regularly update account status. CRAs have improved communication tools for dispute resolution. Public record data standards were enhanced on July 1, 2017, for civil judgments and tax liens. Chairwoman Waters' draft bill, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019 (CCRRA), aims to address concerns regarding inaccurate or disputed data in credit reports. The bill would establish new consumer rights around the dispute process, providing more information about dispute investigations, granting the right to appeal disputes to credit bureaus, and allowing consumers to seek injunctive relief. Additionally, the bill would offer credit restoration to victims of predatory activities. The draft bill, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019, aims to address concerns about inaccurate data in credit reports. It would establish new consumer rights around the dispute process and provide credit restoration to victims of predatory activities. Policymakers are also considering the appropriate length of time negative information should remain on credit reports, which can impact consumers' access to financial services and job opportunities. The draft bill aims to address concerns about inaccurate data in credit reports and establish new consumer rights around the dispute process. It also considers the appropriate length of time negative information should remain on credit reports, impacting consumers' access to financial services and job opportunities. Retaining negative information on credit reports may have benefits and detriments, affecting consumers' credit options and the reliability of credit scores. Negative tradelines on consumer reports can impact the reliability of credit scores and lead to stricter lending policies. Early removal of negative information could hinder fraud detection and favor lenders with more consumer information. Maintaining longer durations of negative tradelines may help in accurate credit scoring. The CCRRA aims to shorten the time adverse information stays on credit reports by three years, allowing for more accurate credit scoring. Inconsistent reporting practices by different debt holders lead to variations in when unpaid debts appear on reports. The CFPB found that approximately 33% of credit reports surveyed had collection tradelines, with medical collections accounting for approximately 52% of those tradelines. Other significant collection tradelines included unclassified debts (17.3%), cable or cellular bills (8.2%), utilities (7.3%), and retail stores (7.2%). Medical debts were typically less than $1,000 for 85% of respondents. More than half of collection tradelines were associated with medical debt, with amounts owed typically under $1,000. The median amount owed for medical collection tradelines was $207, and 75% were under $490. Medical debt is often disputed by consumers due to inconsistent billing practices, leading to delays in payment and appearing as unpaid on credit reports. This raises specific policy issues related to understanding medical costs and insurance coverage. Regulators and industry have taken actions to reduce the negative effects of medical tradelines. Regulators and industry have taken actions to reduce the negative effects of medical tradelines. The IRS rule requires nonprofit hospitals to allow patients 120 days to pay before collection procedures. Credit reporting agencies now have a 180-day waiting period before posting medical collections on credit reports. The CCRRA imposes restrictions on medical collections on credit reports, including a 180-day waiting period before posting. It also provides credit reporting protections for veterans, such as excluding certain medical debt and removing fully paid debts. Active duty military personnel receive free credit monitoring. Consumers may struggle to advocate for themselves regarding credit reporting issues due to lack of awareness of their rights. Consumers face challenges advocating for themselves in credit reporting issues due to lack of awareness of their rights. The CFPB receives numerous credit reporting complaints and provides financial education resources to help consumers understand their rights. The CCRRA proposes that credit reporting agencies offer free credit scores and reports to consumers, especially during significant financial events or identity theft. The CCRRA proposes that credit reporting agencies provide free credit scores and reports to consumers during significant financial events or identity theft. Policy questions arise regarding the use of credit bureau data for purposes such as employment decisions, with some organizations using credit background checks to reduce risks like employee theft. Employers must inform applicants if credit reports are part of hiring decisions to comply with the FCRA. The FCRA requires employers to inform applicants about credit report use in hiring decisions and obtain written permission. If adverse action is taken based on credit information, the applicant must receive a copy of the report and their FCRA rights summary. The CCRRA aims to restrict credit information use in employment decisions, with exceptions for legal requirements or national security. The CFPB notes that 20% of the U.S. population lacks credit scores due to limited credit histories. The CFPB estimates that 20% of the U.S. population cannot have credit scores due to limited credit histories. This includes credit invisibles with no credit record and nonscorable consumers with insufficient or outdated credit histories, totaling approximately 45 million individuals. Younger adults are more likely to be credit invisible or nonscorable, but this issue tends to decrease as they age. Older adults may face the problem of having stale credit records as they reduce credit usage in preparation for retirement. Being nonscorable can depend on credit reporting data and scoring models used. Borrowers with missing credit histories can improve by using credit building loans like secured credit cards. These cards require security deposits as collateral and can help build or repair credit histories. Secured credit card lending can assist borrowers in building or repairing credit histories by reporting favorable payment activity to credit bureaus. Alternative credit scoring models may benefit credit invisibles by considering additional predictive consumer payment activity. Including utility and rent payments in credit scores could increase access to financial relationships for individuals with limited credit histories. Including rent payments in credit scores could benefit individuals with limited credit histories, potentially increasing their access to credit. Newer credit scoring models are applying less weight to medical debt due to inconsistencies in reporting and consumer lack of choice in incurring such debt. Regulators and Congress are exploring alternative credit scoring methods, with the FHFA directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider updated credit scoring models in mortgage underwriting. The FHFA is pushing for updated credit scoring models in mortgage underwriting, but full implementation may be slow due to costs. Alternative credit scoring models may not be widely adopted, and other factors like debt-to-income ratio still play a significant role in the underwriting process. The use of alternative credit scores in mortgage underwriting may help some borrowers near a threshold, but may not lead to significant changes in credit access overall. Congressional interest in data protection has increased following the Equifax cybersecurity breach. CRAs are required to adhere to data protection standards under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The FTC enforces data protection standards for CRAs under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, with limited upfront authority. Bills in Congress aim to strengthen oversight of credit bureaus and data furnishers, directing the FTC to ensure sufficient standards for safeguarding consumer information. The CCRRA would expand protections for identity theft victims, including free credit monitoring and identity theft services. It would require the CFPB to create new regulations for these benefits."
