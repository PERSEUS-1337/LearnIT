    "title": "AB 1144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles for a balanced portfolio procurement. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products must meet specific criteria, including having a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority or having an agreement to transfer electricity dynamically to a California balancing authority. Unbundled renewable energy credits earned by entities excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation can also qualify. The renewable energy credit criteria require the generating facility to meet specific requirements, including being used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity put into service after January 1, 2016. The facility's generating capability must result in incremental increases in electricity generation, excluding participation in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for procurement credited towards each compliance period, including a minimum percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. This excludes participation in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program and includes firmed and shaped renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Retail sellers must meet procurement requirements for eligible renewable energy resource electricity products. Contracts executed after specific dates have limitations on meeting product content requirements. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy resource was eligible at the time of contract execution. The commission may reduce a procurement content requirement for retail sellers if they demonstrate inability to comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The reduction cannot go below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. The public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. The renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser. The electricity generated and sold by the public entity must be included in the total retail sales for calculating renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations."
