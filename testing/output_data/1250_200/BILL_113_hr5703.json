    "content": "The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" defines cultural property and identifies the appropriate congressional committees. It also includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that protecting international cultural property is crucial for US cultural diplomacy, as it reflects respect for other cultures and the shared heritage of humanity. Instances of cultural property loss, damage, and destruction have occurred due to various factors like political instability, armed conflict, and natural disasters. Specific examples include the ransacking of museums in Egypt, looting of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, and damage to medieval cities in Syria due to the civil war. These incidents have resulted in the irreversible destruction and loss of valuable ancient artifacts, leaving gaps in the historical record. In Syria, ongoing civil war has led to the shelling of medieval cities, damage to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and looting of museums and archaeological sites. ISIS/ISIL in Iraq and Syria has destroyed cultural sites and artifacts, while in Mali, Ansar Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in Timbuktu. Afghanistan saw the Taliban decree the destruction of cultural heritage sites. In Afghanistan, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, leading to worldwide condemnation. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge systematically destroyed Buddhist temples, statues, and literature. In China, the Cultural Revolution resulted in the destruction of antiques and old Beijing. In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, artifacts, and archives, partially damaging the 17th century city of Jacmel. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused massive loss of life and damaged cultural properties in eleven countries, including UNESCO World Heritage Sites like Mahabalipuram in India, Sun Temple of Koranak, and Old Town of Galle in Sri Lanka. The destruction of these sites represents an irreparable loss of humanity's cultural heritage. The United States Armed Forces have played a role in preserving cultural property through the establishment of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas. The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) teams, known as the \"Monuments Men,\" were formed by the military to secure and return art stolen by the Nazis during World War II. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield supports the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts and disasters. The United States policy is to protect and preserve international cultural property. The United States policy is to protect and preserve international cultural property at risk of destruction due to various factors, prevent the importation of pillaged cultural property, and enforce laws to prevent trafficking in stolen or looted cultural property.

The President appoints a White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection to coordinate and promote efforts involving multiple Federal agencies, submit annual reports to congressional committees, provide policy recommendations, resolve interagency differences, and work with domestic and international actors.
